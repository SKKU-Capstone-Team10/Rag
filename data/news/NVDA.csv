Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after US export curbs, sources say",1748088000000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's TWSE:2330 advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported. The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market."" TSMC declined to comment.MARKET SHARE PLUNGE China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name.Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei (HWT.UL) which produces the Ascend 910B chip.Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU045:0-nvidia-to-launch-cheaper-blackwell-ai-chip-for-china-after-us-export-curbs-sources-say/"
Nvidia CEO calls Trump re-industrialisation policies 'visionary',1748085487000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden.Nvidia will provide its latest generation AI data centre platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson OMXSTO:ERIC_A and drug developer AstraZeneca LSE:AZN . Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by previous President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips. Huang, who had earlier called controls ""a failure,"" said President Donald Trump wanted U.S. firms to ""win"".""American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown,"" he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University. ""The President would like American technology to win with Nvidia and American companies to sell chips all over the world and to generate revenues, tax revenues, invest and build in the United States,"" he said. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues. Many businesses and economists, though, have warned tariffs could have the opposite effect and lead to a recession in the United States and a global downturn by pushing up costs, upending supply chains and hurting consumer and business confidence.Huang said many policies related to re-industrialisation were ""very visionary"". ""Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain - all of that is excellent,"" he said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L5N3RW01A:0-nvidia-ceo-calls-trump-re-industrialisation-policies-visionary/"

How CoreWeave Stock Became a $2 Billion Win for Nvidia — Barron's,1748050200000,"Ed LinNvidia may be best known for artificial-intelligence chips, but the company hasn't been a slouch in some of its investing activity. An early stake in a hot stock has paid off enormously.In April 2023, Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, long before that cloud provider's initial public offering this March. The 17.9 million preferred CoreWeave shares Nvidia purchased, at $5.58 each, were converted into an equivalent amount of common shares with the IPO. Nvidia invested another $250 million in CoreWeave's IPO, paying $40 a share for 6.25 million more shares.All told, as of the end of March, Nvidia owned 24.2 million CoreWeave shares, a 7% stake, according to a form Nvidia filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using a recent trading price of $83.42 — already more than double the $40 IPO price — that stake is valued at $2.02 billion, a paper profit of $1.67 billion on the $350 million Nvidia paid.Nvidia declined to comment. It referred Barron's to CoreWeave's regulatory filings.CoreWeave is a pure play on AI. All of its revenue comes from cloud-based rentals of AI servers that use Nvidia chips.In April 2023, the same month Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, the two companies reached a master services agreement for CoreWeave to provide Nvidia with infrastructure and platform services. Through the end of 2024, Nvidia had paid CoreWeave about $320 million under the pact.Inside Scoop is a regular Barron's feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members — so-called insiders — as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/
Income Investing: Options Can Be a Source Of Cash — or Information — Barron's,1748050200000,"They can be a source of cash or a source of information. By Al RootIncome investors usually want to keep it simple, and stock options are anything but. They can still be a useful tool, however, especially when pondering the safety of a dividend.That's not the first thing that people typically think of when they contemplate stock options. Though they're often viewed as synonymous with speculation, they can also hedge positions, provide portfolio income, and gauge the potential size of stock moves around significant events such as earnings.Options, as their name suggests, give the holder the ""option"" to buy or sell a stock at a fixed price in the future. Call options give the right to buy a stock, while put options grant the right to sell. How does that work? Let's say investors think Nvidia stock will go up. They could buy shares for a recent $132, and wait. If the stock trades to $240, they would make about 82%.But for $10, investors who believe that Nvidia stock is heading higher can purchase a call option on the stock that gives them the right to buy the shares for $200 each in about one year. If the stock trades up to $240 in a year, they would then execute the option, take ownership of the stock for $200, and then sell it for $240, giving them a gain of $30 — they paid $10 for the option — or 300% on their initial investment. Of course, an option can be an all-or-nothing bet. If Nvidia stock closes below $200 in a year, the $10 disappears.Investors don't need to buy and sell options for them to be useful. Options can also tell investors a lot about the safety of the dividends for the stocks they own, says Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics, a 27-year-old research firm. That's a valuable tool these days, considering the volatility induced by trade wars, geopolitics, and recession fears.The math to determine dividend direction can get complicated. Options prices reflect a lot of factors simultaneously, including a stock's expected volatility, the time to expiration, the level of interest rates, and, yes, dividend payments. Traders have to account for all of these when figuring out what to pay for an option, and if all other factors are controlled for, it's possible to see what traders are predicting for the dividend.They're not always right. After Covid-19 crushed markets in early 2020, options prices for Philip Morris International reflected a dividend cut. The cut never arrived. Instead, the company raised its dividend about 3% that year. More recently, markets took a dip around President Donald Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day,"" as investors worried that high tariff rates and an escalating trade war would create a Covid-like market crisis. The Cboe Volatility index — better known as the VIX — spiked from less than 20 shortly before the announcement to more than 50 in early April. Despite the volatility, options on Philip Morris, which yields 3.1%, never reflected a dividend cut after the tariff announcements, says DeSimone.Philip Morris is known for the safety of its dividend, but what about some others with high yields that appear increasingly uncertain? DeSimone looked at chemical makers Dow and LyondellBasell Industries, which yield 9.3% and 9%, respectively, and food company Kraft Heinz, which has a 5.7% payout, and found that the options market isn't implying a dividend cut in their futures. There's no guarantee that the companies won't cut their dividends. Dow and Lyondell have been suffering from depressed earnings and cash flow resulting from falling chemical prices amid weak global demand . Kraft, for its part, hasn't grown earnings for a decade and recently announced a strategic review to boost lagging performance.Those situations have made investors nervous. The options analysis, however, suggests that there's reason for optimism. For income investors, it's a place to start.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522002520:0/

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/
Platinum Gets a Glimmer of Hope. But Gold Still Rules. — Barrons.com,1748041860000,"By Andrew BaryPlatinum prices are starting to rise, and the rally could have legs. It has been a while since it was a precious-metal king. In May 2014, platinum traded for $1,500 an ounce, $200 more than gold. But since then, it has trailed gold. On Thursday, gold was at $3,323 an ounce, and platinum, $1,017.Platinum supply runs about seven million ounces annually from mining and recycling, compared with more than 100 million ounces of gold. Platinum has been in deficit for the past two years, meaning that demand has exceeded supply and the market has been drawing down aboveground stocks. The World Platinum Investment Council estimates that the deficit will continue in 2025.One reason: More than half of mined platinum comes from South Africa, where mines are often old, deep, and expensive to operate. The WPIC sees mined supply falling 6% this year to 5.4 million ounces. Unlike gold, platinum lacks central bank demand. Some 40% of demand comes from car catalytic converters, threatened by electric vehicles, which lack converters. But EV sales have stalled, and popular hybrids use converters.Meanwhile, Chinese buyers priced out of gold are turning to platinum. The largest platinum exchange-traded fund, Abrdn Physical Platinum Shares, hit a 52-week high this past week and is up 18% in 2025. As Aberdeen's director of ETF investment strategy, Bob Minter, says, ""For platinum investors, the long wait may be over.""Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsOn Monday, markets digested Moody's U.S. debt downgrade and the passage through a House committee of Republicans' tax and budget bill.

Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues. A Closer Look At Retail EarningsThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:360202c0e094b:0-taking-stock-of-the-earnings-picture/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

On Friday, Wedbush analysts maintained their Outperform rating on the stock and raised their price target to $500 from $350.Intuit, the owner of TurboTax and Credit Karma, rose 8% after boosting its fiscal-year outlook following stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. The company expects fiscal-year revenue of $18.72 billion to $18.76 billion, an increase of 15% from a year earlier compared with previous guidance that called for a revenue jump of 12% to 13%.Workday reported first-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates as subscription revenue rose 13% to about $2.06 billion. The software company said it anticipates second-quarter subscription revenue of $2.16 billion — up nearly 14% from a year earlier, but slightly below forecasts. Shares fell 12.5%.Nuclear energy stocks surged after President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders that were meant to kickstart the production of nuclear power in the U.S., including a directive to speed up the construction of advanced reactors at federal sites.

Former Oklo board member Chris Wright was appointed Trump's energy secretary earlier this year.Copart, the platform for online car auctions, reported improved fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue. The stock declined 12%, however, as revenue of $1.21 billion, up 7.5% from a year earlier, was below expectations of $1.21 billion.Ross Stores tumbled 10% after the discount department store chain withdrew its fiscal-year guidance because of the uncertainty surrounding tariffs. The company said that while it directly imports ""only a small portion of our merchandise, more than half of the goods we sell originate from China. As such, we expect pressure on our profitability if tariffs remain at elevated levels.""Deckers Outdoor cratered 20% after the maker of Hoka running shoes and UGG boots issued fiscal first-quarter guidance that missed Wall Street expectations. Deckers said it expects earnings in the period of 62 cents to 67 cents a share, below consensus of 79 cents. The company also forecast first-quarter revenue that missed estimates. Deckers said it wouldn't be providing fiscal 2026 guidance because of ""macroeconomic uncertainty related to evolving global trade policies.""Hinge Health gained 7.3%. Shares of the digital physical therapy company, which makes a device that eases muscle and joint pain as well as software to treat musculoskeletal issues, opened for trading Thursday at $39.25, up 23% from its initial public offering price of $32, and finished the session at $37.56.MNTN rose 4% after wavering throughout the session. It made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, opening at $21 a share — well above its IPO price of $16 — and closed up 65% at $26.36. MNTN makes marketing software aimed at streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon.com.Booz Allen Hamilton, the technology consulting company, sank 16% after fiscal fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates and current fiscal-year guidance disappointed, and said it would be cutting 2,500 jobs.

U.S. Stock Futures Plunge on Trump Tariff Concerns,1748012160000,"Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet.After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K.

It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation. See you next week.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Hims & Hers Health and AST SpaceMobile have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1748004600000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Tutor Perini Corp. TPC as the Bull of the Day and YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Tutor Perini Corp. just beat and raised 2025 earnings guidance as its construction backlog hit a record high. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) expects earnings in 2026 and 2027 to more than double 2025 earnings.Tutor Perini is a civil, building and specialty construction company offering general contracting and design-build services to private customers and public agencies worldwide. It has expertise on large, complex projects.Tutor Perini often self-performs multiple project components including earthwork, excavation, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditions as well as fire protection.It's a small cap company with a market cap of $1.88 billion.Big Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini reported its first quarter 2025 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 783%. It reported earnings of $0.53 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.06.It was the company's second best first quarter EPS ever.Tutor Perini has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters.Revenue was up 19% to $1.25 billion from $1.05 billion in the year ago period. Growth was solid across all three segments but was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects. These projects have significant scope of work remaining.During the first quarter, the company voluntarily repaid the remaining $121.9 million outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, which contributed to a 24% reduction in the company's total debt as compared to the total debt at the end of 2024.Tutor Perini expects solid operating cash flow for the rest of 2025.Tutor Perini has a Record BacklogThe business keeps rolling in. In the first quarter, Tutor Perini booked another $2 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, bringing the company's new backlog to a record of $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2025.That is up 94% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2024.Included in those new awards and contracts was the $1.18 billion Manhattan Tunnel project in New York; a $100 million electrical project in Texas; $241 million in additional funding for the Apra Harbor Waterfront Repairs project in Guam; and $111 million of additional funding for certain healthcare facility projects in California.Additionally, the backlog is expected to remain robust as it has already won more than $500 million in new awards in the second quarter of 2025.But it is not resting on these laurels. Other big projects are available. In the Civil segment, Tutor Perini recently bid the multi-billion-dollar Midtown Bus Terminal Replacement project in New York and was awaiting contractor selection by the owner.Tutor Perini Expects No Impact from the TariffsMany investors are worried about the impact of the 2025 tariffs. As of May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini did not expect to see any significant impact from the tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding.But they will take that quarter by quarter.Tutor Perini Raised Full Year Earnings GuidanceWith a record backlog and opportunities to add to it further, it's not a surprise that Tutor Perini is bullish about 2025.It raised full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.95 from its prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.90.Tutor Perini is lightly followed on the Street, but one analyst did raise their earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026 after the earnings report.The Zacks Consensus jumped to $1.84 from $1.53 prior to the report. That is earnings growth of 158.8% as the company lost $3.13 last year.2026 is also looking bullish as the company said they expect earnings to more than double that of 2025 in 2026 and 2027.1 estimate was raised for 2026 in the last 30 days as well, pushing up 2026 to $2.87. That is further earnings growth of 56%.Here's what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart.Shares Soar in 2025Tutor Perini is a small cap company. The small caps have struggled in 2025 but not Tutor Perini.Shares soared to new 5-year highs on the earnings beat and guidance raise and are outperforming the Russell 2000 small cap index year-to-date.Yet, the company is still attractively priced. Tutor Perini trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.3.But it has even cheaper value metrics with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.4 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. A P/S ratio under 1.0 and a P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicate value.With a record backlog, Tutor Perini is a small cap stock to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:YETI Holdings, Inc. cut guidance in May 2025 due to the impact of the tariffs. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is now expected to see a double-digit decline in earnings this year.YETI is a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor products worldwide. This includes coolers, drinkware, backpacks and bags.A Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 8, 2025, YETI reported its first quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.04. Earnings were $0.31 compared to the consensus of $0.27.This was the 5th earnings beat in a row.Net sales rose 3% to $351.1 million from $341.4 million a year ago. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 4% to $196.2 million primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.While Wholesale channel sales rose just 1% to $154.9 million, also due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.However, the first quarter seems like a different world as Liberation Day tariffs changed the business in April.YETI's Plan to Mitigate the TariffsYETI already had a plan for supply chain diversification, which is ahead of plan. It is aggressively diversifying its sourcing out of China.It expects, by the end of 2025, to have limited exposure to future goods sourced from China. Less than 5% of its total costs of goods will be related to products from China, for the U.S. market.YETI's ability to generate cash is expected to be intact, even with the disruption from the tariff impacts.YETI Lowers 2025 GuidanceBut while it is mitigating the tariffs, sales and earnings are still expected to be impacted.For 2025, adjusted sales are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, down from its prior projection of 5% to 7%.Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.02, down from the prior projection of $2.90 to $2.95.Not surprisingly, the analysts had to cut their estimates to get in line with the new guidance. 10 estimates were cut in the last 30 days for 2025.The Zacks Consensus fell to $2.04 from $2.88. That's down 25.3% from 2024, when YETI made $2.73.10 estimates were also cut for 2026.You can see the results on the price and consensus chart.Shares Near 1-Year LowsYETI was a pandemic winner as people headed outdoors. But since 2022, it's been tougher.Shares are down double digits over the last year.It's cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value.YETI has a strong balance sheet. It had cash of $259 million as of the end of the first quarter and total debt of $77 million.However, it lowered its 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $100 to $125 million from $200 million due to the impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher tariff cost.Investors interested in YETI might want to wait for more certainty on the tariff fall-out before jumping in.Additional content:3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Scales All-Time HighsThe cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. , PayPal Holdings and NVIDIA Corp. . Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers.Bitcoin's rally followed the U.S. equity market's slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value.Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing.Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market.3 Crypto-Centric Stocks With UpsideVisaVisa Inc. is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.

PYPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3.NVIDIANVIDIA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of NVDA's stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.NVIDIA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 41.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 90 days.

Nvidia Stock Rises. Why Next Week Is a Big One for the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1748002440000,"By George Glover and Adam ClarkNvidia stock was edging higher in muted trading on Friday, with the artificial-intelligence chip maker's next blockbuster earnings report now just days away.Shares ticked up 0.1% to $132.90 in early trading. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.3%.Friday is expected to be a quiet trading session, with many on Wall Street already looking forward to the Memorial Day long weekend. But next week ought to be a big one for Nvidia, with the company set to post its first-quarter results after Wednesday's close.The report is expected to underline surging AI demand. Analysts expect earnings of 73 cents a share and forecast that revenue will jump 66% from a year ago to $43.3 billion, according to a FactSet poll.""We believe that demand for H200 [chips], coupled with initial GB200 ramps should drive a modest beat relative to consensus/guidance, despite in quarter disruption of H20 sales to China,"" wrote Stifel analyst Ruben Roy in a research note.Nvidia is set to lose out on $15 billion worth of sales from the Trump administration's tightened controls over its H20 chip for the Chinese market, according to CEO Jensen Huang.""We would expect this set of results/outlook to drive sideways to modestly higher share price performance given the imminent GB300 ramp later this year.""Roy has a Buy rating and $180 target price.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices shares climbed 0.7% Friday.

Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/
"Amid 'Jensanity', Nvidia signals plans to keep AI crown",1747989780000,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry, and delivering a subtle but crucial message from the U.S. AI chip king on how it plans to keep its crown. While 'Jensanity' swirled around Huang at the Computex trade fair, Nvidia itself was at a crossroads. Having grown to become the world's most valuable chip company, investors fear a drop in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as damage to sales from U.S. trade friction.U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips and designs inferior alternatives compliant with evolving U.S. policy. Now, cloud computing giants such as Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have signalled cuts to AI spending. And while the 62-year old CEO has in the past month announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars in regions such as the Gulf, analysts said such deals are likely to become scarce.""Is every country going to announce a $10 billion or $50 billion data centre like the Saudis? Of course not,"" said Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg. ""They're sort of running out of obvious deals."" When asked by Reuters how Nvidia planned to deal with AI spending slowdown, Huang said, ""AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world... AI infrastructure is going to be a part of society."" NEW GROWTHAt Computex, Huang revealed a means of growth that does not rely on mega sovereign infrastructure arrangements: new technology that expands Nvidia's grip on the AI market.The tech's centrepiece is called NVLink Fusion. It allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure, thereby becoming a platform upon which others can build. ""Instead of having to build the entire rack of equipment themselves, (companies) could innovate or differentiate on the custom (chip) itself,"" said Nick Kucharewski, vice president at Marvell Technology NASDAQ:MRVL .The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells.Nvidia has also begun to reach into the enterprise market. This week, it launched a line of servers that Huang described as an ""enterprise AI supercomputer"".Huang's pitch was that the servers open up a multi-billion dollar market because customers can use them for ""everything"", such as graphics, virtual machines and AI applications. The enterprise market is large but difficult to break into, said Seaport Research's Goldberg. Deals tend to be small - compared with a sovereign data centre - and more expensive and time-consuming to win.""My sense is we're sort of bumping up against the limits of expanding the customer base,"" Goldberg said.TAIWAN ECOSYSTEM Nvidia works with some of Taiwan's biggest names in tech, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TWSE:2330 , which makes many of its chips. However, the underlying infrastructure for AI would not be possible without the hundreds of Taiwanese companies big and small supplying components and manufacturing know-how needed to construct Nvidia's complex AI systems.""The purpose of Computex was to bring together the ecosystem and the supply chain,"" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consultancy More Than Moore.Such a network is necessary to support the deals announced in the Gulf and that are likely coming elsewhere in the world in the coming months, Cutress said.Taiwanese industry has embraced Huang, who is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old.By the time he flew out on Friday, Huang had appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive, including Chairman Young Liu of AI server builder Foxconn TWSE:2317 who called him the ""leader of Team Taiwan"".MediaTek TWSE:2454 CEO Rick Tsai gave Huang chunks of guava in a plastic bag from the Nvidia leader's favoured fruit stall in Taipei during one of the chip designer's events.Solomon Technology TWSE:2359 , a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions which uses Nvidia's software tools, said working with Nvidia is a win-win situation.Shares of Solomon have surged 241% since Huang mentioned the firm at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in March last year.""The collaboration with Nvidia has given us greater visibility. We weren't very well-known before, but with Nvidia's support, many more people know us now,"" said Solomon Chairman Johnny Chen.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RV068:0-amid-jensanity-nvidia-signals-plans-to-keep-ai-crown/"
NVDA: Nvidia Stock in the Red for the Year Ahead of Big Earnings Update. Here’s What to Expect.,1747988409000,"Chipmaker is floating at a loss for the year as the AI run has lost some of its steam. Can the quarterly figures catapult the shares in the black? 📉 Nvidia in Red in 2025- Nvidia stock NASDAQ:NVDA was gyrating 4% under the flatline for the year Thursday as traders and investors were cautiously waiting for the company’s first-fiscal quarter 2026 earnings report. - Coming Wednesday, May 28, after the closing bell, this one’s going to be a massive event that could shake the fabric of the stock market. 🧐 The Figures: Big Hopes- Investors are looking for Nvidia to pull off another blockbuster print — or risk deeper doubt that the AI-fueled rally can keep pace. - Expectations are high: the Street is eyeballing earnings per share of $0.73, up from $0.61 a year earlier, and a staggering, record $43.3 billion in revenue versus $26 billion picked up at the same time last year. 🥊 $5.5 Billion Hit- There’s also a potential hit that could weigh on Nvidia’s top and bottom lines. The chipmaker recently disclosed a $5.5 billion writeoff tied to H20 chips designed for the Chinese market. Why? US export controls torpedoed Nvidia’s ability to sell them. - That painful loss — even for a company with Nvidia’s firepower — raises questions about the vital China exposure and whether that part of the business can be made whole. 🎤 Hear It from the Man Himself- Besides the actual performance figures for the quarter, markets will be tuning in to hear from the man himself. Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, will be speaking to shareholders, presenting the roadmap and laying out the forward guidance. - Is there a pivot in play to replace lost China revenue? What’s the status of AI chip demand in other markets? But also, what’s up with the shift to selling to whole nations as a way to diversify away from selling to Big Tech? 🎨 New Revenue Streams in the Works- That’s the potentially bullish case. Nvidia is expanding its footprint in the Middle East . The company has been deepening ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where sovereign-backed AI investments are ramping up. - While it’s early innings, Wall Street will be eager to hear whether Gulf demand can help fill the China gap — and whether it will show up on the revenue line this year or next.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:854a3c676094b:0-nvda-nvidia-stock-in-the-red-for-the-year-ahead-of-big-earnings-update-here-s-what-to-expect/

"Nvidia Remains 'Best Positioned' in AI Despite China Export Restrictions, Oppenheimer Says",1747940319000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA remains ""best positioned"" in artificial intelligence despite the loss of H20 chip sales to China following US government restrictions, Oppenheimer said in a Thursday note. The firm said it sees upside to the company's fiscal Q1 results due next week and expects the company to issue fiscal Q2 outlook in line with analyst expectations. Oppenheimer expects the chipmaker to report fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings of $0.92 per share, up from its previous forecast of $0.91. Segment wise, the firm said it expects the data center business to record a 71% increase in revenue year-over-year thanks to ""robust demand"" for the company's GB200 AI systems. Oppenheimer said production of the flagship rack-scale systems appears to have moved past initial growing pains. The firm said it also sees sovereign AI as a growing portion of Nvidia's revenue, with China representing a total addressable market of $50 billion. The firm expects a potential China-compliant SKU from Nvidia in July. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously called US export restrictions on AI chips to China a ""failure,"" saying the measures have prompted Chinese firms to shift purchases to domestic chipmakers, including Huawei. Still, as recently as Wednesday, the White House said it would maintain its efforts to prevent advanced AI technology from reaching China, rebuffing Huang's call for relief. China currently represents less than 5% of Nvidia's sales, Oppenheimer said. The firm reiterated an outperform rating on the stock and $175 price target.

"Nvidia Faces China Pressure Ahead of Key Q1 Report, Oppenheimer Warns",1747937958000,"May 22 - Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA is expected to post strong fiscal first-quarter earnings on May 28, though its outlook may be tempered by weakness in China, according to Oppenheimer.Analyst Rick Schafer said Nvidia will likely exceed earnings estimates but forecast guidance may come in ""roughly in line"" due to reduced shipments of the H20 chip to China.Schafer noted production challenges for Nvidia's GB200 systems appear resolved. The firm expects full-year shipments of Blackwell 200/300 NVL72 systems to meet or exceed 40,000 units.Nvidia's upcoming GB300 (Ultra) remains on track for a third-quarter release, Schafer added. Roughly half of Nvidia's sales are tied to its top five hyperscale customers, though management is working to broaden its revenue base.The analyst maintained an ""Outperform"" rating and $175 price target, citing Nvidia's advantage from its integrated stack of AI-focused hardware and software and its rack-level systems approach.Wall Street expects the company to report earnings of $0.73 per share on $43.18 billion in revenue for the quarter, according to a consensus of analysts.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:a28d7d72a094b:0-nvidia-faces-china-pressure-ahead-of-key-q1-report-oppenheimer-warns/

OpenAI and Nvidia back $100B Stargate AI project in UAE,1747930110000,"The United Arab Emirates is set to become a central player in global artificial intelligence infrastructure as tech giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, and Cisco partner with Emirati firm G42 to build one of the largest AI campuses in the world. The Stargate UAE project, confirmed by the companies on Thursday, will be located in Abu Dhabi and marks the international expansion of a sweeping AI development programme launched earlier this year by the Trump administration. The site is expected to span 10 square miles and feature a 5-gigawatt capacity, with its first 200-megawatt AI cluster scheduled to go live in 2026.UAE project part of Trump-era $100B AI infrastructure dealThe Stargate UAE initiative stems from a joint infrastructure commitment announced in January by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The US-led plan initially pledged $100 billion in funding for domestic data centre projects and later expanded with an additional $500 billion earmarked for global efforts through 2029. The UAE campus will be the first major overseas project under this framework, directly supporting the administration’s strategy to build secure, decentralised AI infrastructure with allied nations.President Donald Trump, during his Middle East visit last week, unveiled a series of commercial AI deals, including the UAE venture.The collaboration aims to support not only US national AI resilience but also to offer trusted infrastructure to allied governments seeking advanced compute capacity.OpenAI and Oracle to manage 1 GW of computeUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Oracle will jointly operate a 1-gigawatt compute cluster, with G42 leading construction and deployment. Nvidia will supply high-performance AI chips, while Cisco is tasked with providing networking and connectivity solutions for the site. The firms said that the first phase will activate in 2026 with 200 megawatts of AI compute, which will be scaled up to full capacity in phases.OpenAI noted the partnership is part of its broader initiative to build AI facilities that promote responsible use while strengthening US-aligned digital infrastructure abroad. Oracle, which already has cloud operations in the region, is expected to integrate Stargate into its international cloud network, allowing the UAE campus to serve as a key node in global AI compute availability.UAE emerges as AI infrastructure hubThe Stargate UAE project positions the Gulf nation as a critical AI hub amid a broader push by the UAE government to diversify its economy and accelerate digital transformation. G42, which has partnered with OpenAI since 2023, is a major player in the UAE’s tech ecosystem, overseeing AI projects spanning healthcare, smart cities, and defence. The new campus will build on this foundation and contribute to local upskilling, energy innovation, and regional AI adoption.The partnership also aligns with Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment goals, allowing it to anchor AI infrastructure in the Middle East with support from US technology leaders. While the project highlights growing ties between US firms and the Gulf state, it also comes as global tech supply chains shift, particularly in data centre energy sourcing and chip availability.International rollout follows 16-state US expansion planIn February, OpenAI revealed it was evaluating sites in 16 US states to build similar data centre campuses as part of the original $100 billion initiative. The UAE project marks the first confirmed international site, although more are expected to follow as the programme expands.By combining sovereign funding with private sector leadership, the Stargate series of projects represents one of the largest coordinated AI infrastructure developments in history. It aims to provide compute access for startups, governments, and enterprises in a secure and geopolitically aligned manner, at a time when demand for AI power is rapidly outpacing current capacity.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:78195b5cf094b:0-openai-and-nvidia-back-100b-stargate-ai-project-in-uae/

These Are the Only 6 Stock Stocks in NVIDIA's 13F Portfolio,1747929420000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NVDA] Many investors closely watch 13F filings from institutional money managers. While chip giant NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA isn’t typically seen in that role, it must file as well, since it manages over $100 million in U.S.-traded securities.Below is a breakdown of the six stocks listed on  NVIDIA’s most recent 13F .Examining these holdings provides insight into the types of technology that this pioneering company is betting on.All return data calculates the change in price through the May 21 close, since NVIDIA revealed its initial stake in these companies, including their initial rise.NVIDIA’s Top 3 Chip and AI Infrastructure Investments Don’t Fall Far From the Tree [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] By far, NVIDIA’s largest 13F holding was CoreWeave NASDAQ:CRWV .CoreWeave accounted for 78% of NVIDIA’s total reported 13F holdings in Q1.Aside from owning approximately 7% of CoreWeave, the company is also one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers. CoreWeave uses its close relationship with NVIDIA to rent out the company’s most advanced AI chips to customers before anyone else.On its last earnings call, CoreWeave said it was the first to deploy NVIDIA’s GB200 Grace Blackwell systems at scale.Since going public in March, CoreWeave has increased by a staggering 169%, driven largely by the excitement surrounding its  NVIDIA relationship . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] The next two largest NVIDIA 13F holdings are Arm NASDAQ:ARM and Applied Digital NASDAQ:APLD .They represent around 10% and 4% of NVIDIA’s total $1.15 billion 13F portfolio . NVIDIA actually tried to fully acquire ARM in 2020 for $40 billion; however, the transaction fell through due to regulatory issues.ARM provides “IP cores,"" essentially the basic designs of chips that companies base their advanced chips on.As such, ARM is a very important but somewhat underappreciated player in semiconductors. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:APLD] Applied Digital is somewhat similar to CoreWeave, renting out computing power to customers.However, it still gets a good amount of its revenue from cryptocurrency miners , something that CoreWeave no longer dabbles in.The company is also tiny, comparatively, worth only around $1.5 billion.Since November 2024, when  NVIDIA first reported owning Applied Digital , the stock is down approximately 1%.AI-Drug Research, Computing, & Autonomous Driving Round Out NVIDIA’s 13F Portfolio [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:RXRX] NVIDIA’s fourth largest 13F holding is the clinical-stage drug company, Recursion Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ:RXRX .The company has no medicines approved by regulators yet, and thus doesn’t generate much revenue.Overall, the company’s free cash flow over the last 12 months was around -$400 million.The company is attempting to use AI to accelerate drug discovery and development.Importantly,  Recursion is an NVIDIA customer that uses the firm’s chips to power its supercomputer to achieve its mission.It is prioritizing work on four cancer treatments and two rare disease treatments.Even after jumping 24% the day NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February 2024, shares are down 51%. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NBIS] NVIDIA’s final two holdings are Nebius Group NASDAQ:NBIS and WeRide NASDAQ:WRD , each making up around 2% of its portfolio.Nebius’s business model is also very similar to CoreWeave’s, which is renting out AI computing power. Like CoreWeave, it is also seeing incredible revenue growth , reporting a 385% increase in sales in Q1.Nebius will be among the first companies that will offer NVIDIA’s new Blackwell Ultra AI factory platform.Despite rising 7% on the day the initial NVIDIA investment came out, investors have seen shares drop nearly 7% overall. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:WRD] Last up is WeRide. The company operates a variety of robotaxis and other autonomous driving vehicle platforms, primarily in China.WeRide uses NVIDIA’s advanced chips to operate its technology.Even including the 83% surge in shares after NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February, they have fallen nearly 40% overall since then as of May 21.NVIDIA’s 13F Holdings: Prudent Examination Still Reigns SupremeThere is one clear common thread among all these companies in which NVIDIA is investing : they are either customers or suppliers of NVIDIA. This makes sense considering that NVIDIA would deeply understand their businesses.Overall, having investments from NVIDIA doesn't mean investors should blindly follow behind the tech giant and invest in these stocks.This is especially true as merely associating with NVIDIA can often drive wild up moves in these names, only to see their shares crater back to earth.Still, NVIDIA's investment is a positive, and directing a watchful eye toward these names makes sense.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:35d463924094b:0-these-are-the-only-6-stock-stocks-in-nvidia-s-13f-portfolio/
"Nvidia Outlook in Focus Amid China Headwinds, Wedbush Says",1747927541000,"Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA ability to grow sales to offset the loss of H20 chip sales to China will be in focus when the company releases its Q1 results on May 28, Wedbush said in a report Thursday. ""The primary question around results and guidance is can NVDA lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20/China business,"" Wedbush analysts said. They said H20 demand was running ahead of expectations into early April when the US announced a ban on sales into China. They also said Blackwell, if anything, has ramped better than anticipated following some initial stumbles. ""We remain comfortable with our CQ1 and consensus estimates at $43B,"" the analysts said, adding that they were less certain about Q2 amid the loss of China sales. ""We also believe NVDA's Q2 revenue outlook matters less, as investors become more confident around NVDA's intermediate term growth outlook following recent announcements around planned AI data center investments,"" they said.

3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High,1747927320000,"The cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain.

President Trump's SALT Bill in Focus,1747926000000,"Well, all week we had been looking for a market catalyst, with economic prints scarce and Q1 earnings season winding down. We finally got it yesterday, with news that the “big, beautiful bill” was about to pass the House — that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk’s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending.However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1.

Semtech to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards for the Stock?,1747924560000,"Semtech Corporation SMTC is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results after market close on May 27.For first-quarter fiscal 2026, Semtech expects net sales of $250 million (+/- $5 million), indicating 21% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $249.79 million, indicating a rise of 21.20% from the year-ago quarter.SMTC anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share to be 37 cents (+/- 3 cents). The consensus mark for the same is pegged at 38 cents, unchanged over the past 60 days, indicating a robust year-over-year improvement of 533%.Factors to Consider for SMTCSemtech’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strength across its infrastructure and high-end-consumer end markets. Similarly, the wireless end-market is likely to have witnessed strong growth owing to SMTC’s increasing 5G offerings. Continued growth in FiberEdge and Tri-Edge products, particularly for 400G/800G modules, is likely to boost the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Semtech Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Semtech Corporation price-eps-surprise | Semtech Corporation QuoteStrong Momentum across its Signal Integrity and Analog Mixed Signal & Wireless product lines is expected to have contributed well. The growing adoption of artificial intelligence might have been a plus for the upcoming quarter.Growing traction across hyperscale data center applications on the back of Tri-Edge and FiberEdge transimpedance amplifier products is expected to have aided SMTC’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The increasing demand for LoRa devices and LoRaWAN standards is expected to have contributed positively to top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The availability of its one-channel LoRaWAN hub reference design and evaluation kit targeting smaller-scale network deployments, such as for SMB/SME and smart home applications, is anticipated to impact its fourth-quarter results positively.However, Macroeconomic challenges, including the protracted inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates, are likely to have posed challenges for the company in the fiscal fourth quarter. Delayed adoption of CopperEdge products due to architectural changes in server racks is likely to affect SMTC’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 results.Additionally, escalating tensions between the United States and China might have raised concerns. Softness in the industrial end-market and the Connectivity segment is expected to have been a major negative.What Our Proven Model Says for SMTC’s Q1 EarningsAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

We finally got it yesterday, with news that the “big, beautiful bill” was about to pass the House — that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk’s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending.However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1.

Kraken launches tokens to offer 24/7 trading of U.S. equities,1747923186000,"Crypto exchange Kraken said on Thursday it is launching tokens of U.S. equities that will trade around the clock, giving non-U.S. investors exposure to high-profile companies such as Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA .Tokenization refers to the process of issuing digital representations of publicly-traded securities. Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities.The tokens' launch outside the U.S. comes amid growing interest in blending traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. While tokenized securities have yet to gain widespread adoption, proponents say they hold the potential to significantly reshape how people access and invest in financial markets.In a January opinion piece for the Washington Post, Robinhood NASDAQ:HOOD CEO Vlad Tenev said tokenization could also allow retail investors to access private companies' stocks. Kraken's tokens, called xStocks, will be available in select markets outside the United States, it said, without naming the markets. The move was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.The offering is currently not available for U.S. customers.The renewed enthusiasm for blockchain has also coincided with bitcoin's BITSTAMP:BTCUSD rally as investors anticipate lighter regulation under President Donald Trump.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU156:0-kraken-launches-tokens-to-offer-24-7-trading-of-u-s-equities/"

The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.2%.Nvidia is set to report its first-quarter earnings after next Wednesday's closing bell. The company's results have become a must-see event in recent years, with sales of its graphics processing units tending to be a good barometer of broader AI demand.Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a research note published late Wednesday that he was expecting ""upside results and a roughly in-line July-quarter outlook, despite the loss of the loss of H20 sales to China following U.S. government restrictions."" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has slammed Washington's chip curbs, designed to stop Beijing from getting its hands on the company's advanced AI chips, this week.Schafer said the stock remained ""best-positioned in AI."" He rates shares at Outperform, with a $175 price target that implies they have upside of 33%.Other chip maker stocks were also rising on Thursday.

'Stargate UAE' AI datacenter to begin operation in 2026,1747922400000,"The first phase of a massive new artificial data center in the United Arab Emirates will come online in 2026, likely with 100,000 Nvidia chips.The ""Stargate UAE"" project is part of a deal brokered last week by U.S. President Donald Trump to build the world's largest set of AI data centers outside the United States, despite previous U.S. restrictions on sending advanced technology to the UAE because of its close ties to China.The 10-square-mile (26-sq-km) site in Abu Dhabi will eventually host 5 gigawatts worth of data centers.The first phase of that project will be the 1-gigawatt Stargate UAE project, built by state-backed UAE firm G42 in partnership with U.S. firms OpenAI, Oracle NYSE:ORCL , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Cisco Systems NASDAQ:CSCO , as well as Japan's SoftBank Group TSE:9984 . The companies on Thursday said that the Stargate UAE project will use Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, currently the most advanced AI server that Nvidia offers.The first 200 megawatts of capacity will go live in 2026, the companies said. The group did not give a number of servers, but analyst firm TrendForce estimates that GB300 servers with 72 chips each consume about 140-kilowatts of power, which equates to about 1,400 servers or 100,000 Nvidia chips.This first-in-the-world platform will enable every UAE government agency and commercial institution to connect their data to the world's most advanced AI models,"" Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief technology officer and chairman, said in a statement.The Trump administration earlier this month rescinded a rule put in place by President Joe Biden that would have restricted the flow of AI chips to countries such as the UAE. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has not said what will replace the rule but said last week that it will convene a working group between the U.S. and UAE to ensure that the project meets ""robust U.S. security standards and other efforts to responsibly deploy AI infrastructure, both in the UAE and globally.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RT0Y9:0-stargate-uae-ai-datacenter-to-begin-operation-in-2026/"

Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives.

"Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after US export curbs, sources say",1748088000000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's TWSE:2330 advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported. The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market."" TSMC declined to comment.MARKET SHARE PLUNGE China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name.Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei (HWT.UL) which produces the Ascend 910B chip.Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU045:0-nvidia-to-launch-cheaper-blackwell-ai-chip-for-china-after-us-export-curbs-sources-say/"

Nvidia CEO calls Trump re-industrialisation policies 'visionary',1748085487000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden.Nvidia will provide its latest generation AI data centre platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson OMXSTO:ERIC_A and drug developer AstraZeneca LSE:AZN . Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by previous President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips. Huang, who had earlier called controls ""a failure,"" said President Donald Trump wanted U.S. firms to ""win"".""American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown,"" he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University. ""The President would like American technology to win with Nvidia and American companies to sell chips all over the world and to generate revenues, tax revenues, invest and build in the United States,"" he said. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues. Many businesses and economists, though, have warned tariffs could have the opposite effect and lead to a recession in the United States and a global downturn by pushing up costs, upending supply chains and hurting consumer and business confidence.Huang said many policies related to re-industrialisation were ""very visionary"". ""Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain - all of that is excellent,"" he said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L5N3RW01A:0-nvidia-ceo-calls-trump-re-industrialisation-policies-visionary/"

How CoreWeave Stock Became a $2 Billion Win for Nvidia — Barron's,1748050200000,"Ed LinNvidia may be best known for artificial-intelligence chips, but the company hasn't been a slouch in some of its investing activity. An early stake in a hot stock has paid off enormously.In April 2023, Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, long before that cloud provider's initial public offering this March. The 17.9 million preferred CoreWeave shares Nvidia purchased, at $5.58 each, were converted into an equivalent amount of common shares with the IPO. Nvidia invested another $250 million in CoreWeave's IPO, paying $40 a share for 6.25 million more shares.All told, as of the end of March, Nvidia owned 24.2 million CoreWeave shares, a 7% stake, according to a form Nvidia filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using a recent trading price of $83.42 — already more than double the $40 IPO price — that stake is valued at $2.02 billion, a paper profit of $1.67 billion on the $350 million Nvidia paid.Nvidia declined to comment. It referred Barron's to CoreWeave's regulatory filings.CoreWeave is a pure play on AI. All of its revenue comes from cloud-based rentals of AI servers that use Nvidia chips.In April 2023, the same month Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, the two companies reached a master services agreement for CoreWeave to provide Nvidia with infrastructure and platform services. Through the end of 2024, Nvidia had paid CoreWeave about $320 million under the pact.Inside Scoop is a regular Barron's feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members — so-called insiders — as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.

Nvidia: Top Analyst Calls May 28 Earnings a 'Positive Clearing Event',1747916122000,"May 22 - Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA is set to report Q1 FY26 results on May 28, offering investors a chance to reassess growth drivers and ease lingering concerns.Cantor Fitzgerald's C.J. Muse, who carries an Overweight rating and $200 price target, expects earnings of $0.88 per share on revenue of $43.26 billion. He calls the upcoming call a likely positive clearing event.Despite anticipated headwinds in China, Muse projects July-quarter revenue of about $46 billion, just shy of the $46.3 billion Wall Street consensus, factoring in a $15 billion hit from H20 chip restrictions and solid early demand for Blackwell chips.He sees a meaningful ramp in GB300 shipments starting in Q4, with roughly 25,000 units shipping in 2025, and forecasts Data Center revenue climbing toward $200 billion next year, up from a $175 billion estimate.Looking beyond the quarter, Muse expects management to maintain a positive tone on AI spending, peg second-half gross margins in the mid-70s, and spotlight emerging areas such as AI factories and Physical AI.On valuation, Nvidia trades at 26.8 times projected 2025 earnings and 19.9 times 2026 estimates, suggesting room for upside as profit growth accelerates.Is NVDA a 'Buy' Before Earnings?Based on the one year price targets offered by 51 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $163.81 with a high estimate of $235.92 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +24.29% from the current price of $131.80.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:62af6a86c094b:0-nvidia-top-analyst-calls-may-28-earnings-a-positive-clearing-event/
How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/

Income Investing: Options Can Be a Source Of Cash — or Information — Barron's,1748050200000,"They can be a source of cash or a source of information. By Al RootIncome investors usually want to keep it simple, and stock options are anything but. They can still be a useful tool, however, especially when pondering the safety of a dividend.That's not the first thing that people typically think of when they contemplate stock options. Though they're often viewed as synonymous with speculation, they can also hedge positions, provide portfolio income, and gauge the potential size of stock moves around significant events such as earnings.Options, as their name suggests, give the holder the ""option"" to buy or sell a stock at a fixed price in the future. Call options give the right to buy a stock, while put options grant the right to sell. How does that work? Let's say investors think Nvidia stock will go up. They could buy shares for a recent $132, and wait. If the stock trades to $240, they would make about 82%.But for $10, investors who believe that Nvidia stock is heading higher can purchase a call option on the stock that gives them the right to buy the shares for $200 each in about one year. If the stock trades up to $240 in a year, they would then execute the option, take ownership of the stock for $200, and then sell it for $240, giving them a gain of $30 — they paid $10 for the option — or 300% on their initial investment. Of course, an option can be an all-or-nothing bet. If Nvidia stock closes below $200 in a year, the $10 disappears.Investors don't need to buy and sell options for them to be useful. Options can also tell investors a lot about the safety of the dividends for the stocks they own, says Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics, a 27-year-old research firm. That's a valuable tool these days, considering the volatility induced by trade wars, geopolitics, and recession fears.The math to determine dividend direction can get complicated. Options prices reflect a lot of factors simultaneously, including a stock's expected volatility, the time to expiration, the level of interest rates, and, yes, dividend payments. Traders have to account for all of these when figuring out what to pay for an option, and if all other factors are controlled for, it's possible to see what traders are predicting for the dividend.They're not always right. After Covid-19 crushed markets in early 2020, options prices for Philip Morris International reflected a dividend cut. The cut never arrived. Instead, the company raised its dividend about 3% that year. More recently, markets took a dip around President Donald Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day,"" as investors worried that high tariff rates and an escalating trade war would create a Covid-like market crisis. The Cboe Volatility index — better known as the VIX — spiked from less than 20 shortly before the announcement to more than 50 in early April. Despite the volatility, options on Philip Morris, which yields 3.1%, never reflected a dividend cut after the tariff announcements, says DeSimone.Philip Morris is known for the safety of its dividend, but what about some others with high yields that appear increasingly uncertain? DeSimone looked at chemical makers Dow and LyondellBasell Industries, which yield 9.3% and 9%, respectively, and food company Kraft Heinz, which has a 5.7% payout, and found that the options market isn't implying a dividend cut in their futures. There's no guarantee that the companies won't cut their dividends. Dow and Lyondell have been suffering from depressed earnings and cash flow resulting from falling chemical prices amid weak global demand . Kraft, for its part, hasn't grown earnings for a decade and recently announced a strategic review to boost lagging performance.Those situations have made investors nervous. The options analysis, however, suggests that there's reason for optimism. For income investors, it's a place to start.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522002520:0/

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteEarnings Whispers for NVIDIAOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NVIDIA this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Though NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3, it has an Earnings ESP of -5.24%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Influence NVIDIA’s Q1 ResultsNVIDIA’s first-quarter top line is likely to have benefited from the continued strength in its Datacenter business. The increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is anticipated to have boosted demand for its chips across the datacenter end market. An increase in hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have acted as tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.The Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $38.5 billion, which indicates robust year-over-year growth of 70.6%.Moreover, NVIDIA’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s results have improved year over year in six out of the last seven quarters, as inventory levels with channel partners have returned to normal. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market is pegged at $3.29 billion, which implies a 24.4% increase from the year-ago quarter’s level.NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing in six consecutive quarters. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $567.6 million, which suggests a 32.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The company’s Automotive segment demonstrated an improvement in trends over the preceding four quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $551.7 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 67.7%.NVIDIA Stock Price Performance & ValuationShares of NVIDIA have remained highly volatile over the past year. NVDA stock has gained 27% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s growth of 23.5%. The stock has also outperformed major semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology have lost 30.1%, 24% and 19.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value NVIDIA offers investors at the current levels. NVIDIA is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 15.48X compared with the industry’s 13.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.NVDA also trades at a premium compared with other semiconductor players, including Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology. Currently, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology trade at a forward P/S multiples of 5.37X, 2.48X and 5.94X, respectively.Investment Consideration for NVIDIAOver the past year, NVIDIA’s revenue growth has been driven by robust demand for chips required for the development of generative AI models. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven useful across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.However, the complexity of generative AI, which requires vast knowledge and immense computational power, means that enterprises will need to significantly upgrade their network infrastructures. NVIDIA’s AI chips, including the A100, H100 and B100, are the top choices for building and running these powerful AI applications, positioning the company as a leader in this space. As the generative AI revolution unfolds, we expect NVIDIA's advanced chips to drive substantial growth in both its revenues and market presence.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles. The company's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity.However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/

Platinum Gets a Glimmer of Hope. But Gold Still Rules. — Barrons.com,1748041860000,"By Andrew BaryPlatinum prices are starting to rise, and the rally could have legs. It has been a while since it was a precious-metal king. In May 2014, platinum traded for $1,500 an ounce, $200 more than gold. But since then, it has trailed gold. On Thursday, gold was at $3,323 an ounce, and platinum, $1,017.Platinum supply runs about seven million ounces annually from mining and recycling, compared with more than 100 million ounces of gold. Platinum has been in deficit for the past two years, meaning that demand has exceeded supply and the market has been drawing down aboveground stocks. The World Platinum Investment Council estimates that the deficit will continue in 2025.One reason: More than half of mined platinum comes from South Africa, where mines are often old, deep, and expensive to operate. The WPIC sees mined supply falling 6% this year to 5.4 million ounces. Unlike gold, platinum lacks central bank demand. Some 40% of demand comes from car catalytic converters, threatened by electric vehicles, which lack converters. But EV sales have stalled, and popular hybrids use converters.Meanwhile, Chinese buyers priced out of gold are turning to platinum. The largest platinum exchange-traded fund, Abrdn Physical Platinum Shares, hit a 52-week high this past week and is up 18% in 2025.

Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

NVIDIA Selects Navitas to Collaborate on Next Generation 800 V HVDC Architecture,1747858661000,"TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Navitas Semiconductor NASDAQ:NVTS , the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast™ gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC™ silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support ‘Kyber’ rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast™ and GeneSiC™ power technologies.NVIDIA’s next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity.Today’s existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency.Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia’s approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability.        Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand.The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra.Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. The high-power GaNSafe™ power ICs integrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world’s safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCC pin.Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V.Enabled by 20 years of SiC innovation leadership, GeneSiC proprietary ‘trench-assisted planar’ technology provides world-leading performance over temperature, delivering high-speed, cool-running operation for high-power, high-reliability applications. G3F SiC MOSFETs deliver high-efficiency with high-speed performance, enabling up to 25°C lower case temperature, and up to 3x longer life than SiC products from other vendors.Offering the industry’s broadest voltage range – stretching from 650 V to ultra-high voltages of 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV, the SiC technology has been implemented in multiple projects for MW energy storage and grid-tied inverters with the Department of Energy (DoE).In August 2023, Navitas introduced a high-speed, high-efficiency  3.2 kW CRPS, achieving a 40% smaller size  than best-in-class, legacy silicon solutions for power-hungry AI and Edge computing. This was followed by the  world’s highest power density 4.5 kW  CRPS, achieving a ground-breaking 137 W/in3, and an efficiency of over 97%. In November 2024, Navitas released the  world’s first 8.5 kW  AI data center power supply, powered by GaN and SiC that could meet 98% efficiency, complying with the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Rack v3 (ORv3) specifications. Additionally, Navitas created  IntelliWeave, an innovative patented new digital control  technique, that when combined with high-power GaNSafe and Gen 3-Fast SiC MOSFETs, enables PFC peak efficiencies to 99.3% and reduces power losses by 30% compared to existing solutions. Alongside the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, the latest release of their 12 kW PSU was presented at the Navitas ‘ AI Tech Night’ on 21st May.“We are proud to be selected by NVIDIA to collaborate on their 800 HVDC architecture initiative. Our latest innovations in high-power GaN and SiC technologies have seen world firsts and have created new inflections into markets such as AI datacenters and electric vehicles ”, said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. “With our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU. We appreciate that NVIDIA recognizes our technology and commitment to driving the next generation of data center power delivery.”NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC architecture will improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% (due to fewer PSU failures), and lower cooling costs by directly connecting HVDC to the IT and compute racks.To read NVIDIA’s technical blog, please click here .

Nvidia lost half its market share in China: find out how,1747857481000,"Nvidia Corp NASDAQ:NVDA is in focus on Wednesday after Jensen Huang, its chief executive, said the AI darling has lost nearly half of its market share in China due to the Trump administration’s new export controls.In a press conference at Computex, he went on to call those restrictions a “failure”, adding they’re not hurting China as much as they’re hurting the US businesses.Huang’s remarks arrive shortly after US President Donald Trump secured a sizable multi-year AI infrastructure deal for Nvidia during his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Following the tariffs-related crash, Nvidia stock is now up some 45% versus its year-to-date low.US export controls may be helping ChinaAccording to Jensen Huang, recently tightened restrictions on the export of sophisticated chips have slashed Nvidia’s market share in China from a whopping 95% to just 50% within weeks.Additionally, the federal controls are doing more harm to American businesses, also because they have motivated the world’s second-largest economy to accelerate plans of making its own chips, he added.This could prove a threat to the US dominance in artificial intelligence since Huang has already confirmed that Beijing is “right behind” Washington in AI, and now that it’s motivated to design its own chips, it could gain further ground on that front in no time.Note that Nvidia shares are still down some 10% versus their year-to-date high.Huawei could gain share if Nvidia is restricted from selling to ChinaStacy Rasgon, a senior Bernstein analyst, also agrees that making it harder for Nvidia to play in China, the Trump administration is practically giving away the region’s AI market to Huawei.Huawei’s capabilities in artificial intelligence are not lost on Jensen Huang either.“They’re incredible in computing and network technology, all essential capabilities to advance AI. They have made enormous progress in the last several years,” he acknowledged in a recent statement.Investors should note that there have already been reports of Huawei working on its advanced chip that could go neck-and-neck with the US chipmakers, including NVDA, in the coming years.Is Nvidia stock worth buying ahead of Q1 earnings release?Huang’s remarks arrive a week before Nvidia is scheduled to report its earnings for fiscal Q1.Consensus is for the artificial intelligence company to earn 82 cents a share in its current quarter, well above the 58 cents per share it earned in the same quarter last year.Ahead of the chipmaker’s release, the AI stock is worth owning, argued a Loop Capital analyst, Ananda Baruah, in his research note on Wednesday.Baruah maintained his “buy” rating on NVDA shares this morning.He’s convinced the stock could hit $175 over the next 12 months. The analyst’s price target indicates potential upside of another 30% from current levels.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:6c25a3a30094b:0-nvidia-lost-half-its-market-share-in-china-find-out-how/

Malik, who maintains a Buy rating and $150 price target, highlighted Huang's praise for ChatGPT as a prime example of AI transforming information access. He also noted that ending the AI Diffusion Rule under President Trump shows how well-intentioned export curbs can backfire, and he applauded Nvidia's new NVLink Fusion tech for answering customer demand for faster, more scalable interconnects. Looking ahead to the May 28 fiscal Q1 report, Malik expects revenue of $44.5 billionjust shy of the $46 billion Street viewciting lost H20 sales in China and softer Hopper demand.Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah and team also reiterated a Buy on NVDA, lifting their price target to $175 ahead of the same earnings release. They argue that Nvidia's Q1 print and July guidance can be good enough to support shares into a materially stronger second half of 2025. Their work suggests calendar-year 2026 GPU demand could exceed 8 million unitsup from 6 million this yearand they're confident the stock can look through any guidance hiccups.This matters because Nvidia's ability to translate Computex hype into sustainable revenue hinges on execution across hardware, software and supply?chain strategy, especially as geopolitical shifts reshape chip flows.Investors will want to watch Nvidia's May 28 Q1 results and management commentary for confirmation that AI momentum and new interconnect innovations can offset near-term demand headwinds and support lofty price targets.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:42801b15e094b:0-nvidia-leans-into-ai-at-computex-wins-citi-backing/

Speaking at Computex in Taipei, Huang said U.S. export controls didn't stall China's AI pushthey accelerated it. Four years ago, we had 95% of the market in China. Now we're down to 50%, he said. The other half? Homegrown competitors, supercharged by local funding and urgency. Huang pointed to Huawei and other Chinese players who are now aggressively building alternatives. They will use the second-best. Local companies are very determined, he added.It gets worse. The Biden-era AI chip rulesmeant to limit the global spread of cutting-edge AIforced Nvidia to scrap its customized H20 chip and eat a $5.5 billion write-down. Huang didn't mince words, calling the assumptions behind the AI diffusion rule fundamentally flawed. The Trump administration now appears to agree, signaling it'll reverse course and ditch the planned three-tier licensing structure. If finalized, that shift could open the door for U.S. companies to expand AI exportsjust not to nations viewed as adversarial.Meanwhile, Beijing isn't standing still. Chinese tech giants like Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba NYSE:BABA are already moving to secure domestic chips, in line with government pushback against U.S. restrictions. Washington has warned companies to stay away from Chinese AI siliconlike Huawei's Ascendbut that may only be deepening the split. While the U.S. teams up with the UAE to build mega AI data centers powered by Nvidia chips, the real takeaway is this: trying to choke off China's access might have lit a fuse that's now burning faster than expected.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:db800e0b7094b:0-nvidia-ceo-explodes-over-u-s-chip-ban-says-it-helped-china-win-the-ai-race/

These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

"Nvidia CEO Backs President Trump on AI, Blasts Biden's Chip Crackdown",1747842787000,"May 21 - Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Jensen Huang said the U.S. restrictions on exporting AI chips to China have backfired, costing American firms billions in potential sales.Huang said the 2023 ""AI Diffusion"" rule, introduced by the Biden administration, was built on fundamentally flawed assumptions. The policy, which banned exports of high-end chips to China, was aimed at curbing China's AI development but instead boosted Chinese suppliers like Huawei Technologies, he said.Since the rule came into effect, Nvidia's share of the Chinese AI chip market has dropped to about 50% from 95%, Huang noted. He warned that China's domestic AI industry is expanding rapidly, and added, They would love for us never to go back.Nvidia faces an estimated $15 billion revenue impact from restrictions affecting its H20 chips, on top of a $5.5 billion charge reported in April, Huang said. The company is now developing a modified Blackwell chip with slower memory to meet compliance standards.Huang also backed Donald Trump's stance on AI trade policy, saying the former president's plans to roll back the restrictions are a more practical approach.Nvidia shares were down about 1% in early Wednesday trading.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:9cb953187094b:0-nvidia-ceo-backs-president-trump-on-ai-blasts-biden-s-chip-crackdown/

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc.

QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Hims & Hers Health and AST SpaceMobile have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1748004600000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Tutor Perini Corp. TPC as the Bull of the Day and YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Tutor Perini Corp. just beat and raised 2025 earnings guidance as its construction backlog hit a record high. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) expects earnings in 2026 and 2027 to more than double 2025 earnings.Tutor Perini is a civil, building and specialty construction company offering general contracting and design-build services to private customers and public agencies worldwide. It has expertise on large, complex projects.Tutor Perini often self-performs multiple project components including earthwork, excavation, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditions as well as fire protection.It's a small cap company with a market cap of $1.88 billion.Big Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini reported its first quarter 2025 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 783%. It reported earnings of $0.53 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.06.It was the company's second best first quarter EPS ever.Tutor Perini has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters.Revenue was up 19% to $1.25 billion from $1.05 billion in the year ago period. Growth was solid across all three segments but was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects. These projects have significant scope of work remaining.During the first quarter, the company voluntarily repaid the remaining $121.9 million outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, which contributed to a 24% reduction in the company's total debt as compared to the total debt at the end of 2024.Tutor Perini expects solid operating cash flow for the rest of 2025.Tutor Perini has a Record BacklogThe business keeps rolling in. In the first quarter, Tutor Perini booked another $2 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, bringing the company's new backlog to a record of $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2025.That is up 94% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2024.Included in those new awards and contracts was the $1.18 billion Manhattan Tunnel project in New York; a $100 million electrical project in Texas; $241 million in additional funding for the Apra Harbor Waterfront Repairs project in Guam; and $111 million of additional funding for certain healthcare facility projects in California.Additionally, the backlog is expected to remain robust as it has already won more than $500 million in new awards in the second quarter of 2025.But it is not resting on these laurels. Other big projects are available. In the Civil segment, Tutor Perini recently bid the multi-billion-dollar Midtown Bus Terminal Replacement project in New York and was awaiting contractor selection by the owner.Tutor Perini Expects No Impact from the TariffsMany investors are worried about the impact of the 2025 tariffs. As of May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini did not expect to see any significant impact from the tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding.But they will take that quarter by quarter.Tutor Perini Raised Full Year Earnings GuidanceWith a record backlog and opportunities to add to it further, it's not a surprise that Tutor Perini is bullish about 2025.It raised full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.95 from its prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.90.Tutor Perini is lightly followed on the Street, but one analyst did raise their earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026 after the earnings report.The Zacks Consensus jumped to $1.84 from $1.53 prior to the report. That is earnings growth of 158.8% as the company lost $3.13 last year.2026 is also looking bullish as the company said they expect earnings to more than double that of 2025 in 2026 and 2027.1 estimate was raised for 2026 in the last 30 days as well, pushing up 2026 to $2.87. That is further earnings growth of 56%.Here's what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart.Shares Soar in 2025Tutor Perini is a small cap company. The small caps have struggled in 2025 but not Tutor Perini.Shares soared to new 5-year highs on the earnings beat and guidance raise and are outperforming the Russell 2000 small cap index year-to-date.Yet, the company is still attractively priced. Tutor Perini trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.3.But it has even cheaper value metrics with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.4 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. A P/S ratio under 1.0 and a P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicate value.With a record backlog, Tutor Perini is a small cap stock to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:YETI Holdings, Inc. cut guidance in May 2025 due to the impact of the tariffs. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is now expected to see a double-digit decline in earnings this year.YETI is a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor products worldwide. This includes coolers, drinkware, backpacks and bags.A Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 8, 2025, YETI reported its first quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.04. Earnings were $0.31 compared to the consensus of $0.27.This was the 5th earnings beat in a row.Net sales rose 3% to $351.1 million from $341.4 million a year ago. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 4% to $196.2 million primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.While Wholesale channel sales rose just 1% to $154.9 million, also due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.However, the first quarter seems like a different world as Liberation Day tariffs changed the business in April.YETI's Plan to Mitigate the TariffsYETI already had a plan for supply chain diversification, which is ahead of plan. It is aggressively diversifying its sourcing out of China.It expects, by the end of 2025, to have limited exposure to future goods sourced from China. Less than 5% of its total costs of goods will be related to products from China, for the U.S. market.YETI's ability to generate cash is expected to be intact, even with the disruption from the tariff impacts.YETI Lowers 2025 GuidanceBut while it is mitigating the tariffs, sales and earnings are still expected to be impacted.For 2025, adjusted sales are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, down from its prior projection of 5% to 7%.Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.02, down from the prior projection of $2.90 to $2.95.Not surprisingly, the analysts had to cut their estimates to get in line with the new guidance. 10 estimates were cut in the last 30 days for 2025.The Zacks Consensus fell to $2.04 from $2.88. That's down 25.3% from 2024, when YETI made $2.73.10 estimates were also cut for 2026.You can see the results on the price and consensus chart.Shares Near 1-Year LowsYETI was a pandemic winner as people headed outdoors. But since 2022, it's been tougher.Shares are down double digits over the last year.It's cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value.YETI has a strong balance sheet. It had cash of $259 million as of the end of the first quarter and total debt of $77 million.However, it lowered its 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $100 to $125 million from $200 million due to the impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher tariff cost.Investors interested in YETI might want to wait for more certainty on the tariff fall-out before jumping in.Additional content:3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Scales All-Time HighsThe cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. , PayPal Holdings and NVIDIA Corp. . Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers.Bitcoin's rally followed the U.S. equity market's slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value.Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing.Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market.3 Crypto-Centric Stocks With UpsideVisaVisa Inc. is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.

D-Wave Stock Surges 28%. The Company Made an Advancement in the Quantum Race. — Barrons.com,1747835280000,"By Mackenzie TatananniD-Wave Quantum said Tuesday that its sixth-generation quantum system had become available over the cloud, marking another development in the race to develop commercially viable quantum computers.The Advantage2 system is the successor to D-Wave's Advantage, which was released in September 2020. For now, customers will be able to access Advantage2 through D-Wave's Leap cloud service, though physical machines will be deployed gradually over the next few years.Management cited the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines could effectively handle.Shares soared 28% to $16.90 on Tuesday. The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.Trevor Lanting, the company's chief development officer, told Barron's that D-Wave had focused on building greater connectivity between quantum bits, or the basic units of information in a quantum machine.""This allows us to pose more complex problems and solve them with the technology, whether they're business optimization problems or lattice materials,"" Lanting explained.Other improvements allowing the technology to run more efficiently, such as improved coherence and a higher energy scale, have reduced its appetite for power compared with previous generations, Lanting said.""Fundamentally, this is energy-efficient computing for hard problems,"" Lanting continued. ""I think you're going to see a lot more focus on the energy footprint of computation over the next decade. It's growing and it's growing fast.""While Advantage2 will only be accessible over the cloud for now, D-Wave plans to upgrade on-premises systems in years to come. These include the machine purchased by the Jülich Supercomputing Centre in February and the system currently being installed at Davidson Technologies' headquarters in Alabama.CEO Alan Baratz told Barron's that an upgrade was a ""multi-month exercise.""""We've got to warm up the system, we've got to install the new processor, we've got to cool down the system, we've got to recalibrate the system — and just the calibration process itself could take four to six months, "" Baratz explained.The CEO has been one of the most outspoken advocates of quantum technology, particularly its commercial applications. This has resulted in pushback from critics including the authors of a short report in April who alleged that the company oversold itself and made false claims about the performance of its systems. (Baratz told Barron's that the allegations were ""ridiculous"" and the report itself was ""full of misinformation."")The report came at a time when shares had already been beaten down substantially. D-Wave and peers began sliding at the end of March following Nvidia's annual developer conference, where timelines for wide-scale deployment of the technology failed to materialize.Investor frustration culminated in a selloff that caused some quantum stocks to see double-digit declines, D-Wave among them. The stock closed down 18% on Nvidia's inaugural ""Quantum Day.""That wasn't the only thing weighing on shares. Ahead of the event, D-Wave claimed it had demonstrated ""quantum supremacy"" after one of its systems completed a materials simulation task in 20 minutes that would've taken one of the world's most powerful supercomputers nearly 1 million years.Shares climbed on the heels of the announcement, but as scrutiny mounted those gains slipped away. The stock's most recent ascent came on the heels of D-Wave's first-quarter financial results, which included record revenue and a narrower quarterly loss.The caveat about quantum pure-plays is that they are not yet profitable. This has been a pervasive issue for the industry, with stocks trading largely on headlines and sentiment.While D-Wave didn't turn a profit in its latest quarter, revenue increased 509% from a year earlier. Bookings, a metric representing customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future, decreased 64% to $1.6 million.Baratz had an explanation. ""We're in the early stages of commercializing quantum, so as we're getting started, bookings are going to be more lumpy as opposed to smoothly increasing,"" the CEO said.The metric can be parsed into three types of deals: professional services, quantum-as-a-service, and system sales. System sales carry a hefty price tag, to the tune of $20 to $40 million apiece, and have a longer lead time as a result.The cost barrier is one reason why it's difficult to determine a timeline for wide-scale deployment. Another is the sensitive nature of quantum computers themselves. As the basic units of information in a system are subatomic particles like photons or electrons, this makes them particularly sensitive to environmental interference, which can cause the machines to bungle calculations.Until these more pervasive issues are resolved, it is unclear when quantum computing will catch on. However, the technology has the potential to dramatically transform the field of drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and the financial sector.D-Wave, for one, is already at work on its next generation of quantum processors, with a focus on increasing qubit count to create more powerful multi-chip solutions.'We're able to do calculations beyond the reach of possibility for classical systems,"" Lanting told Barron's. ""There is a gap and that gap will continue to open up very rapidly. That's the promise of quantum computing.""Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia Stock Rises. Why Next Week Is a Big One for the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1748002440000,"By George Glover and Adam ClarkNvidia stock was edging higher in muted trading on Friday, with the artificial-intelligence chip maker's next blockbuster earnings report now just days away.Shares ticked up 0.1% to $132.90 in early trading. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.3%.Friday is expected to be a quiet trading session, with many on Wall Street already looking forward to the Memorial Day long weekend. But next week ought to be a big one for Nvidia, with the company set to post its first-quarter results after Wednesday's close.The report is expected to underline surging AI demand. Analysts expect earnings of 73 cents a share and forecast that revenue will jump 66% from a year ago to $43.3 billion, according to a FactSet poll.""We believe that demand for H200 [chips], coupled with initial GB200 ramps should drive a modest beat relative to consensus/guidance, despite in quarter disruption of H20 sales to China,"" wrote Stifel analyst Ruben Roy in a research note.Nvidia is set to lose out on $15 billion worth of sales from the Trump administration's tightened controls over its H20 chip for the Chinese market, according to CEO Jensen Huang.""We would expect this set of results/outlook to drive sideways to modestly higher share price performance given the imminent GB300 ramp later this year.""Roy has a Buy rating and $180 target price.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices shares climbed 0.7% Friday. Broadcom stock slid 0.2%, Intel gained 0.5%, and Qualcomm was up 0.2%.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"HPE Stock Is Rising Again. Expect More Gains, Analyst Says. — Barrons.com",1747835160000,"Mackenzie TatananniShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise have slumped this year due to disappointing financial results and broader market weakness. However, analysts believe the stock could see explosive gains, with their most optimistic case forecasting 72% upside to the current price.Evercore ISI analysts upgraded shares of the server and cloud-software company to Outperform from In Line, and lifted the price target to $22 from $17, citing a ""fairly attractive"" risk-reward balance, ""specially for investors that have some duration.""Shares climbed 3.4% to $18.05, on pace for their highest close since March 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.The Evercore upgrade had much to do with it. In the Tuesday note, analysts presented a handful scenarios showing how the stock price could rise as high as $31 or sink as low as $15.Investors are waiting for the Justice Department to approve HPE's merger with Juniper Networks after moving to block it earlier this year. (Evercore expects ""some concessions from HPE"" to push the deal through.)In this upside scenario, the analysts expect HPE to deliver ""double-digit [earnings per share] growth"" through the first year following the merger, with operational issues also being resolved. In their view, earnings growth could lift the stock to around $24.If the Juniper deal doesn't pan out, the analysts believe this could drive the stock price even higher. Out of options, HPE might be forced to employ ""aggressive cost reduction and optimization efforts"" to improve operating margins across both its Hybrid Cloud and Intelligence Edge segments.""This would effectively provide an 'alternative' path to an activist asking for an excessive/levered buyback,"" the analysts wrote. Like the first argument, they believe earnings growth could push HPE shares to $26 to $31.The firm's least-favorable scenario calls for ""business as usual,"" with the deal not closing, and HPE ""maintaining the status quo."" That would keep the stock range-bound, between $15 and $16, the Evercore team said.Another news item may have contributed to the stock's ascent on Tuesday. The Evercore upgrade came after HP announced it had fine-tuned its HPE Private Cloud AI, which it co-developed with Nvidia, ""to further aid AI developers.""HPE stock ended Monday's session down 1.6%. The year-to-date loss stood at 16%, tamped down by a mix of macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointing financial results.The stock cratered in March after HPE posted a mixed first-quarter print, including guidance that undershot expectations. Shares are off 26% from a record high of $24.42, set on Jan. 22.Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Criticizes AI Chip Curbs as Market Share in China Falls,1747834697000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) chief executive Jensen Huang said U.S. export controls on AI chips to China had backfired, cutting the company's market share and accelerating the rise of Chinese chipmakers like Huawei.Revenue figures weren't disclosed, but Huang said Nvidia's share of the AI chip market in China plunged to 50% from nearly 95% since the start of former President Joe Biden's administration. He attributed the decline to U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced chips, which spurred Chinese firms to develop alternatives.Huang said the export curbs energized local players, giving them spirit, energy, and government support to build a self-reliant semiconductor supply chain. Huawei and others have reportedly filled demand gaps left by U.S. companies.The Biden-era restrictions were intended to limit China's access to AI chips over national security concerns. However, Huang said former President Donald Trump's decision last week to roll back parts of the policy reflected a better understanding of global competition. He said the prior approach had the wrong goal.Beijing condemned fresh U.S. guidance discouraging the use of Chinese chips, saying it violated earlier trade understandings and warning of firm steps if U.S. actions harm Chinese interests.- Explore Nvidia's insider activity. - See valuation trends on the Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1c26b4f3e094b:0-nvidia-nvda-ceo-criticizes-ai-chip-curbs-as-market-share-in-china-falls/

"Nvidia CEO Backs Trump, Criticizes AI Chip Curbs",1747831857000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang criticized the U.S. government's restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence chips to China, calling the policy a ""failure"" that cost American companies billions in lost revenue.Speaking at the Computex conference in Taipei, Huang said the Biden-era export rules created under the so-called AI Diffusion policy were based on flawed assumptions. The rules, introduced in January, blocked high-end processor sales to China and limited supply to other countries. Huang emphasized that over half of the world's AI researchers are based in China, and the U.S. restrictions forced many to turn to local suppliers like Huawei.President Donald Trump has said he plans to end the policy if re-elected. Huang voiced support for that plan, saying it acknowledges that U.S. firms are not the only providers of advanced chips. Earlier this year, Microsoft raised similar concerns, saying the policy could boost China's AI sector.Nvidia's share of the Chinese AI chip market has dropped from 95% to 50% since President Biden took office. Huang estimated the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion next year, a major opportunity the company risks missing.Earlier this week, Nvidia said the U.S. licensing rule for its H20 GPUs could cost it $15 billion in revenue.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:928c4848f094b:0-nvidia-ceo-backs-trump-criticizes-ai-chip-curbs/

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/
Nvidia (NVDA) Backs Trump Plan to Reverse AI Chip Curbs,1747830637000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) CEO Jensen Huang said the U.S. export curbs on AI chips to China failed to achieve their goals and instead caused major financial harm to American companies. He endorsed the Trump administration's effort to abandon the tiered restrictions.Nvidia has taken a $5.5 billion charge related to U.S. limits on exports of its H20 chips to China. Huang estimated the restrictions could cost Nvidia up to $15 billion in lost revenue.The company's China market share dropped to 50% from 95% since the Biden administration imposed the AI diffusion rule, which blocked advanced chip exports to China. In response, Chinese firms like Huawei gained traction, and the country boosted its domestic chip infrastructure.Huang said competition in China has become intense and noted that many in the country would prefer Nvidia not return. He projected the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion by 2026, a key opportunity despite geopolitical hurdles.To navigate current limits, Nvidia is working on a modified Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with U.S. rules. Meanwhile, China has demanded that Washington remove discriminatory chip measures, warning of further action if curbs persist.The Trump administration is reportedly considering a new global licensing regime to replace the existing three-tier model, which could give the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.- See insider trades for NVDA. - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:15ffb745a094b:0-nvidia-nvda-backs-trump-plan-to-reverse-ai-chip-curbs/
"Amid 'Jensanity', Nvidia signals plans to keep AI crown",1747989780000,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry, and delivering a subtle but crucial message from the U.S. AI chip king on how it plans to keep its crown. While 'Jensanity' swirled around Huang at the Computex trade fair, Nvidia itself was at a crossroads. Having grown to become the world's most valuable chip company, investors fear a drop in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as damage to sales from U.S. trade friction.U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips and designs inferior alternatives compliant with evolving U.S. policy. Now, cloud computing giants such as Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have signalled cuts to AI spending. And while the 62-year old CEO has in the past month announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars in regions such as the Gulf, analysts said such deals are likely to become scarce.""Is every country going to announce a $10 billion or $50 billion data centre like the Saudis? Of course not,"" said Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg. ""They're sort of running out of obvious deals."" When asked by Reuters how Nvidia planned to deal with AI spending slowdown, Huang said, ""AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world... AI infrastructure is going to be a part of society."" NEW GROWTHAt Computex, Huang revealed a means of growth that does not rely on mega sovereign infrastructure arrangements: new technology that expands Nvidia's grip on the AI market.The tech's centrepiece is called NVLink Fusion. It allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure, thereby becoming a platform upon which others can build. ""Instead of having to build the entire rack of equipment themselves, (companies) could innovate or differentiate on the custom (chip) itself,"" said Nick Kucharewski, vice president at Marvell Technology NASDAQ:MRVL .The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells.Nvidia has also begun to reach into the enterprise market. This week, it launched a line of servers that Huang described as an ""enterprise AI supercomputer"".Huang's pitch was that the servers open up a multi-billion dollar market because customers can use them for ""everything"", such as graphics, virtual machines and AI applications.

However, the underlying infrastructure for AI would not be possible without the hundreds of Taiwanese companies big and small supplying components and manufacturing know-how needed to construct Nvidia's complex AI systems.""The purpose of Computex was to bring together the ecosystem and the supply chain,"" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consultancy More Than Moore.Such a network is necessary to support the deals announced in the Gulf and that are likely coming elsewhere in the world in the coming months, Cutress said.Taiwanese industry has embraced Huang, who is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old.By the time he flew out on Friday, Huang had appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive, including Chairman Young Liu of AI server builder Foxconn TWSE:2317 who called him the ""leader of Team Taiwan"".MediaTek TWSE:2454 CEO Rick Tsai gave Huang chunks of guava in a plastic bag from the Nvidia leader's favoured fruit stall in Taipei during one of the chip designer's events.Solomon Technology TWSE:2359 , a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions which uses Nvidia's software tools, said working with Nvidia is a win-win situation.Shares of Solomon have surged 241% since Huang mentioned the firm at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in March last year.""The collaboration with Nvidia has given us greater visibility.

Malaysia government not involved in local AI project involving Huawei chips,1747829410000,"Malaysia's government did not develop, coordinate or endorse an artificial intelligence project involving a local company and Huawei Technologies, its trade ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, backtracking on a previous announcement. The statement followed local media reports on Monday that a Malaysian company, Skyvast Corporation, would deploy Huawei's Ascend chips for the project. The ministry said it wanted ""to clarify that the said initiative was not developed, endorsed, or coordinated by the Government of Malaysia, nor does it form part of any Government-to-Government agreement or nationally mandated technology programme.""Huawei told Reuters that it has not sold any Ascend chips in Malaysia, and the Malaysian government has not purchased any of those chips from them. Huawei developed the Ascend chips after it was blocked by the U.S. government from receiving advanced semiconductors. The chips have since become an alternative for Chinese firms after Washington moved to further curb sales of high-end chips by top AI chip maker Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA to China. The Trade Ministry added that the country remains committed to fully complying with all applicable export control laws, national security directives, and emerging guidance from global regulatory authorities.

NVDA: Nvidia Stock in the Red for the Year Ahead of Big Earnings Update. Here’s What to Expect.,1747988409000,"Chipmaker is floating at a loss for the year as the AI run has lost some of its steam. Can the quarterly figures catapult the shares in the black? 📉 Nvidia in Red in 2025- Nvidia stock NASDAQ:NVDA was gyrating 4% under the flatline for the year Thursday as traders and investors were cautiously waiting for the company’s first-fiscal quarter 2026 earnings report. - Coming Wednesday, May 28, after the closing bell, this one’s going to be a massive event that could shake the fabric of the stock market. 🧐 The Figures: Big Hopes- Investors are looking for Nvidia to pull off another blockbuster print — or risk deeper doubt that the AI-fueled rally can keep pace. - Expectations are high: the Street is eyeballing earnings per share of $0.73, up from $0.61 a year earlier, and a staggering, record $43.3 billion in revenue versus $26 billion picked up at the same time last year. 🥊 $5.5 Billion Hit- There’s also a potential hit that could weigh on Nvidia’s top and bottom lines. The chipmaker recently disclosed a $5.5 billion writeoff tied to H20 chips designed for the Chinese market. Why? US export controls torpedoed Nvidia’s ability to sell them. - That painful loss — even for a company with Nvidia’s firepower — raises questions about the vital China exposure and whether that part of the business can be made whole. 🎤 Hear It from the Man Himself- Besides the actual performance figures for the quarter, markets will be tuning in to hear from the man himself. Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, will be speaking to shareholders, presenting the roadmap and laying out the forward guidance. - Is there a pivot in play to replace lost China revenue? What’s the status of AI chip demand in other markets? But also, what’s up with the shift to selling to whole nations as a way to diversify away from selling to Big Tech? 🎨 New Revenue Streams in the Works- That’s the potentially bullish case. Nvidia is expanding its footprint in the Middle East . The company has been deepening ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where sovereign-backed AI investments are ramping up. - While it’s early innings, Wall Street will be eager to hear whether Gulf demand can help fill the China gap — and whether it will show up on the revenue line this year or next.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:854a3c676094b:0-nvda-nvidia-stock-in-the-red-for-the-year-ahead-of-big-earnings-update-here-s-what-to-expect/
Nvidia's Huang Calls U.S. Export Controls a Failure — WSJ,1747828080000,"By Liza LinTAIPEI — Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said U.S. export controls limiting the sale of advanced chips to China were a failure, contending they have galvanized Beijing to push ahead faster with its own artificial-intelligence technologies.Nvidia has over the past four years lost market share to Chinese competitors because of the restrictions, Huang said.""The local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls give them the spirit, energy and the government support to accelerate their development,"" Huang said Wednesday in Taipei, where he is attending an industry conference.The Biden administration introduced a series of measures crimping the ability of U.S. companies to sell cutting-edge chips, chip-related equipment and technologies to China over national-security concerns. The curbs have particularly affected Nvidia, the leader in chips for AI applications.Many remain in place under President Trump, and the Trump administration added a control in April on the export of an Nvidia AI chip that the company had tailored for sale in China. Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge over the issue.Huang said China was the second-largest computer market globally and would be a $50 billion AI market next year. Revenue from China, he said, could translate to tax dollars and jobs for the U.S.""I think all along the export control was a failure,"" Huang said.At the same time, he praised Trump for reversing one export-control plan that Nvidia had forcefully criticized. In the final days of the Biden administration, officials released a draft of an AI diffusion rule that would have put country caps on the sale of AI chips around the globe, not just to China. The rule was aimed at making it harder for China to access U.S. technology through third countries.The Trump administration rescinded the rule this month before it took effect.""The goal of the AI diffusion rule as specified in the past was to limit AI diffusion. President Trump realizes that it's exactly the wrong goals, "" Huang said.""America is not the only provider of AI technology,"" he said. ""If the United States wants to stay in the lead and the U.S. would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, then we would have to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed.""The removal of the diffusion rule has benefited both Nvidia and countries in places such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia that otherwise would have been curtailed in their ability to build large AI facilities.Days after the rule was pulled, American chip makers including Nvidia unveiled deals to sell hundreds of thousands of the most powerful chips in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar during a visit by Trump and Huang to the region.Huang has crisscrossed the globe over the past month, trying to drum up sales of his AI processors and excitement for his vision of a future driven by AI supercomputers. He has drawn closer to governments around the globe because of the geopolitical importance of AI, standing by Trump's side in the Middle East and meeting senior Chinese officials.Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521002942:0/

Roughly half of Nvidia's sales are tied to its top five hyperscale customers, though management is working to broaden its revenue base.The analyst maintained an ""Outperform"" rating and $175 price target, citing Nvidia's advantage from its integrated stack of AI-focused hardware and software and its rack-level systems approach.Wall Street expects the company to report earnings of $0.73 per share on $43.18 billion in revenue for the quarter, according to a consensus of analysts.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:a28d7d72a094b:0-nvidia-faces-china-pressure-ahead-of-key-q1-report-oppenheimer-warns/
Bull of the Day: D-Wave Quantum (QBTS),1747819200000,"D-Wave Quantum QBTS shares soared over 25% on Tuesday after the company announced its next-generation Advantage quantum computing system.Featuring D-Wave's most advanced quantum processor to date, the Advantage2 system is commercial-grade, and built to address real-world use cases in areas such as optimization, materials simulation and artificial intelligence (AI).But the immediate breakthrough might be that customers will be able to access Advantage2 initially only through D-Wave's Leap cloud service. This marks the first instance of quantum-as-a-service.Quantum Completes the TriumvirateD-Wave CEO Alan Baratz emphasized in the company's Q1 earnings release two weeks ago that they ""became the first to demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computing on a useful real-world problem.""From the May 8 press release...Published the peer-reviewed paper “Beyond-Classical Computation in Quantum Simulation” in Science, validating D-Wave’s demonstration of quantum computational supremacy on a useful real-world problem. This research showed that D-Wave’s annealing quantum computer was able to perform a magnetic materials simulation in minutes that would take nearly one million years and more than the world’s electricity supply on one of today’s most powerful classical supercomputers, the Frontier massively parallel, GPU-based exascale supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This claim met resistance from some technology observers who debated the apples vs. oranges comparisons. But the accomplishments of D-Wave should not be so easily dismissed as there is definitely a ""there, there"" under the surface. As we learned from NVIDIA NVDA CEO Jensen Huang and other quantum experts recently at the first ever NVIDIA Quantum Summit in March, the world's most advanced computers will use a combination of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs, or quantum computing units.QPUs are not only very far from competing with GPUs, they will likely never replace them. And Jensen made sure everyone knew that when he graciously invited those leaders for a pow-wow, a month after completely dismissing the nascent industry.You can learn more about that exciting and controversial event in a podcast I did with Neena Mishra in March... Quantum Computing: Tech's Next Giant Leap?D-Wave's outspoken CEO Baratz sat next to Jensen and you could only cut the tension with a laser. But Baratz had already acknowledged that quantum systems will work in tandem with GPU-based AI, and he proved it with the company's first big sale in February.D-Wave made a big splash in the quantum computing space with their first sale of an Advantage annealing quantum computing system to a high-performance computing (HPC) center, the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), about 54 kilometers west of Cologne, Germany.As Europe’s first and only exascale HPC, the JSC JUPITER supercomputer will utilize D-Wave's Advantage system to facilitate breakthroughs in AI and quantum optimization applications.JUPITER is expected to surpass the threshold of one exaFLOP, or one quintillion floating point operations per second. This will be the world’s first coupling of an annealing quantum computer with an exascale supercomputer, providing a first-of-a-kind opportunity for tackling the world's toughest computational problems.Advantage2 Raises the BarThe Advantage2 system is expected to deliver significant performance gains and efficiency with doubled coherence, increased connectivity and a 40% boost to the energy scale for advanced problem solving.In addition to the Jülich Supercomputing Center, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has already been using prototypes of the new Advantage2 system to advance their research. A LANL engineer and Dale Moore, President and CEO of defense contractor Davidson Technologies, both were quoted in the press release regarding their enthusiasm for continued R&D.Davidson, located in Huntsville, Alabama is a trusted provider of advanced engineering and technical solutions supporting the U.S. Department of Defense, intelligence community, and aerospace industry. With a focus on mission-driven innovation, Davidson combines deep domain knowledge with emerging technologies to solve the nation’s most complex defense challenges.Ahead of this announcement, QBTS shares were already a Zacks #2 Rank because EPS estimates had moved significantly higher between the company's last two quarterly reports, with the full-year 2025 bottom line rising from a loss of 38-cents to only -$0.21.After the Q1 sale to JSC, D-Wave had bragging rights of a 500% jump in revenues on an admittedly small base. Before Tuesday's announcement, full-year 2025 sales were projected to cross $25 million, representing 183% growth.So it's fair to say that with a meteoric 125%+ gain in just 9 trading sessions, investors will be looking for increased sales and clarity on the expected delivery of physical Advantage2 systems -- or if margins will be better with the Leap cloud service.Large hyperscalers (think Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and even Meta and Tesla) and other supercomputing research centers aiming to integrate quantum computing into their infrastructure will definitely want the Advantage2 system in a dedicated on-premise configuration.Qatar Goes Full QuantumAnother fortunate trade wind for D-Wave this past week may be the sizable investments and partnerships being lavished on a private competitor.Quantinuum, the private quantum-computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, finalized a $1 billion agreement with a Qatari investment firm last week. That number is spread over a decade, but it does show a commitment to the technology that has not been seen in the revenues of any of the companies yet.It was thought last year that Quantinuum might fetch a valuation as high as $10 billion if it IPOs this year. That estimate is probably higher now, and driving more investors to bet on the ponies already running on the public track, including Rigetti Computing RGTI and IonQ IONQ.Rigetti was a big winner for members of my TAZR Trader portfolio recently where we took gains of 1,340% and 703%. And IonQ has been of particular interest in my special report Beyond AI: The Quantum Leap in Computing Power because it utilizes the same technology approach as Quantinuum known as ""trapped ion"" computation.After Tuesday's rally in D-Wave shares, TAZR is sitting on open gains of over 1,600% in QBTS.Future's So Fast, You Gotta Wear a HelmetWriting for Barron's on May 15, Mackenzie Tatananni explained the ""ramping global demand"" for the technology.""Quantum computing is often seen as a speculative bet by investors and detractors could argue that its appearance alongside sectors like defense and energy was a surprise. However, the announcement was just another sign that enthusiasm for the technology continues to mount, both in the U.S. and abroad.""Quantinuum said its joint venture agreement with Al Rabban Capital would accelerate the adoption of quantum technology in Qatar and the surrounding region.The 10-year investment horizon includes training new developers and enabling access to Quantinuum's systems. As we've learned with NVIDIA, getting developers on-board and building in the platform ecosystem is key to further adoption across corporations and countries.The partners plan to develop regional-specific uses of quantum in fields such as finance, precision medicine, and genomics, both for academic and industrial clients.Bottom line: While the stock valuations of QBTS, RGTI, and IONQ may be ahead of their revenues, there is excitement among investors big and small, from Qatar to Queens, that QPUs will change the world as fast GPUs in the coming decade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ede8fd1e6094b:0-bull-of-the-day-d-wave-quantum-qbts/
"Oppenheimer Sees Nvidia Beating Q1 Estimates, Warns on China Exposure",1747934834000,"Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer expects Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA to beat consensus EPS of $0.73 and $43.18 billion in revenue for fiscal Q1 ending May 28, driven by recovering GB200 rack-scale production and on-track Blackwell 200/300 volumes set to hit or exceed 40,000 units this year. He notes that the loss of the H20 chip in China could weigh on near-term growth even as GB300 (Ultra) prepares for a seamless Q3 debut. Top-five hyperscale customers still account for roughly half of Nvidia's sales, but management's ongoing diversification of its customer base should help smooth regional headwinds.Schafer, who reiterates an Outperform rating with a $175 price target, underscores Nvidia's full-stack advantage in AI hardware and software and its unique rack-level approach. Despite healthy demand signals, investors will scrutinize this quarter's guidance for signs that China restrictions on the H20 chip will bleed into fiscal Q2. Compared with peers like AMD and Intelwhere shifts in GPU supply and data-center investment remain choppyNvidia's integrated ecosystem and strong hyperscaler relationships could help it navigate geopolitical disruptions more smoothly.Why It Matters Investors should watch whether Nvidia's guidance stays roughly in-line despite upside in Q1 results, as any cautious commentary on China could trigger sectorwide rerating amid stretched AI valuations.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:2de84f830094b:0-oppenheimer-sees-nvidia-beating-q1-estimates-warns-on-china-exposure/

"Paris named as Europe’s leading tech ecosystem, beating London",1747818000000,"Paris has been named as the new European tech champion, beating London for the first time on some metrics, according to data from Dealroom, which collects information on startups and venture capital firms.Between 2017 and 2024, the combined enterprise value of Paris startups increased 5.3 times, compared with 4.2 times for London, Dealroom said, after assessing dozens of metrics that contribute to a successful tech ecosystem.Although London attracted bigger funding rounds, the actual valuations of the companies have not increased dramatically, while the funding rounds secured by Paris-based companies have had a bigger impact on valuations, it said. French tech companies, including Mistral AI and Poolside, raised $7.8 billion last year, less than London’s $11.3 billion.Europe has been falling behind other regions in tech innovations, with only some countries trying to boost tech investments.While the market capitalisation of global tech, media and telecom companies rose from $7 trillion in 2000 to $34 trillion last year, Europe's share dropped from 30% to just 7%, a McKinsey report said on Wednesday. If Europe had maintained its share, it would have generated an additional $8 trillion in market value, it said.Paris is also the only European city on Dealroom's top five global champions list, which is dominated by U.S. cities.It comes a month ahead of Paris hosting one of the largest global tech conferences, VivaTech, featuring top executives from companies such as Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Alibaba NYSE:BABA , Meta NASDAQ:META , OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic and Cohere.

OpenAI and Nvidia back $100B Stargate AI project in UAE,1747930110000,"The United Arab Emirates is set to become a central player in global artificial intelligence infrastructure as tech giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, and Cisco partner with Emirati firm G42 to build one of the largest AI campuses in the world. The Stargate UAE project, confirmed by the companies on Thursday, will be located in Abu Dhabi and marks the international expansion of a sweeping AI development programme launched earlier this year by the Trump administration. The site is expected to span 10 square miles and feature a 5-gigawatt capacity, with its first 200-megawatt AI cluster scheduled to go live in 2026.UAE project part of Trump-era $100B AI infrastructure dealThe Stargate UAE initiative stems from a joint infrastructure commitment announced in January by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The US-led plan initially pledged $100 billion in funding for domestic data centre projects and later expanded with an additional $500 billion earmarked for global efforts through 2029. The UAE campus will be the first major overseas project under this framework, directly supporting the administration’s strategy to build secure, decentralised AI infrastructure with allied nations.President Donald Trump, during his Middle East visit last week, unveiled a series of commercial AI deals, including the UAE venture.The collaboration aims to support not only US national AI resilience but also to offer trusted infrastructure to allied governments seeking advanced compute capacity.OpenAI and Oracle to manage 1 GW of computeUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Oracle will jointly operate a 1-gigawatt compute cluster, with G42 leading construction and deployment. Nvidia will supply high-performance AI chips, while Cisco is tasked with providing networking and connectivity solutions for the site. The firms said that the first phase will activate in 2026 with 200 megawatts of AI compute, which will be scaled up to full capacity in phases.OpenAI noted the partnership is part of its broader initiative to build AI facilities that promote responsible use while strengthening US-aligned digital infrastructure abroad. Oracle, which already has cloud operations in the region, is expected to integrate Stargate into its international cloud network, allowing the UAE campus to serve as a key node in global AI compute availability.UAE emerges as AI infrastructure hubThe Stargate UAE project positions the Gulf nation as a critical AI hub amid a broader push by the UAE government to diversify its economy and accelerate digital transformation. G42, which has partnered with OpenAI since 2023, is a major player in the UAE’s tech ecosystem, overseeing AI projects spanning healthcare, smart cities, and defence. The new campus will build on this foundation and contribute to local upskilling, energy innovation, and regional AI adoption.The partnership also aligns with Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment goals, allowing it to anchor AI infrastructure in the Middle East with support from US technology leaders. While the project highlights growing ties between US firms and the Gulf state, it also comes as global tech supply chains shift, particularly in data centre energy sourcing and chip availability.International rollout follows 16-state US expansion planIn February, OpenAI revealed it was evaluating sites in 16 US states to build similar data centre campuses as part of the original $100 billion initiative. The UAE project marks the first confirmed international site, although more are expected to follow as the programme expands.By combining sovereign funding with private sector leadership, the Stargate series of projects represents one of the largest coordinated AI infrastructure developments in history. It aims to provide compute access for startups, governments, and enterprises in a secure and geopolitically aligned manner, at a time when demand for AI power is rapidly outpacing current capacity.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:78195b5cf094b:0-openai-and-nvidia-back-100b-stargate-ai-project-in-uae/

These Are the Only 6 Stock Stocks in NVIDIA's 13F Portfolio,1747929420000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NVDA] Many investors closely watch 13F filings from institutional money managers. While chip giant NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA isn’t typically seen in that role, it must file as well, since it manages over $100 million in U.S.-traded securities.Below is a breakdown of the six stocks listed on  NVIDIA’s most recent 13F .Examining these holdings provides insight into the types of technology that this pioneering company is betting on.All return data calculates the change in price through the May 21 close, since NVIDIA revealed its initial stake in these companies, including their initial rise.NVIDIA’s Top 3 Chip and AI Infrastructure Investments Don’t Fall Far From the Tree [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] By far, NVIDIA’s largest 13F holding was CoreWeave NASDAQ:CRWV .CoreWeave accounted for 78% of NVIDIA’s total reported 13F holdings in Q1.Aside from owning approximately 7% of CoreWeave, the company is also one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers. CoreWeave uses its close relationship with NVIDIA to rent out the company’s most advanced AI chips to customers before anyone else.On its last earnings call, CoreWeave said it was the first to deploy NVIDIA’s GB200 Grace Blackwell systems at scale.Since going public in March, CoreWeave has increased by a staggering 169%, driven largely by the excitement surrounding its  NVIDIA relationship . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] The next two largest NVIDIA 13F holdings are Arm NASDAQ:ARM and Applied Digital NASDAQ:APLD .They represent around 10% and 4% of NVIDIA’s total $1.15 billion 13F portfolio . NVIDIA actually tried to fully acquire ARM in 2020 for $40 billion; however, the transaction fell through due to regulatory issues.ARM provides “IP cores,"" essentially the basic designs of chips that companies base their advanced chips on.As such, ARM is a very important but somewhat underappreciated player in semiconductors. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:APLD] Applied Digital is somewhat similar to CoreWeave, renting out computing power to customers.However, it still gets a good amount of its revenue from cryptocurrency miners , something that CoreWeave no longer dabbles in.The company is also tiny, comparatively, worth only around $1.5 billion.Since November 2024, when  NVIDIA first reported owning Applied Digital , the stock is down approximately 1%.AI-Drug Research, Computing, & Autonomous Driving Round Out NVIDIA’s 13F Portfolio [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:RXRX] NVIDIA’s fourth largest 13F holding is the clinical-stage drug company, Recursion Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ:RXRX .The company has no medicines approved by regulators yet, and thus doesn’t generate much revenue.Overall, the company’s free cash flow over the last 12 months was around -$400 million.The company is attempting to use AI to accelerate drug discovery and development.Importantly,  Recursion is an NVIDIA customer that uses the firm’s chips to power its supercomputer to achieve its mission.It is prioritizing work on four cancer treatments and two rare disease treatments.Even after jumping 24% the day NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February 2024, shares are down 51%. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NBIS] NVIDIA’s final two holdings are Nebius Group NASDAQ:NBIS and WeRide NASDAQ:WRD , each making up around 2% of its portfolio.Nebius’s business model is also very similar to CoreWeave’s, which is renting out AI computing power. Like CoreWeave, it is also seeing incredible revenue growth , reporting a 385% increase in sales in Q1.Nebius will be among the first companies that will offer NVIDIA’s new Blackwell Ultra AI factory platform.Despite rising 7% on the day the initial NVIDIA investment came out, investors have seen shares drop nearly 7% overall. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:WRD] Last up is WeRide. The company operates a variety of robotaxis and other autonomous driving vehicle platforms, primarily in China.WeRide uses NVIDIA’s advanced chips to operate its technology.Even including the 83% surge in shares after NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February, they have fallen nearly 40% overall since then as of May 21.NVIDIA’s 13F Holdings: Prudent Examination Still Reigns SupremeThere is one clear common thread among all these companies in which NVIDIA is investing : they are either customers or suppliers of NVIDIA. This makes sense considering that NVIDIA would deeply understand their businesses.Overall, having investments from NVIDIA doesn't mean investors should blindly follow behind the tech giant and invest in these stocks.This is especially true as merely associating with NVIDIA can often drive wild up moves in these names, only to see their shares crater back to earth.Still, NVIDIA's investment is a positive, and directing a watchful eye toward these names makes sense.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:35d463924094b:0-these-are-the-only-6-stock-stocks-in-nvidia-s-13f-portfolio/
Nvidia CEO praises Trump move to scrap some AI export curbs,1747793411000,"U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China were ""a failure"" as they have cost American companies billions of dollars in lost sales, Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on Wednesday.Huang's comments were levelled at the Biden administration's AI diffusion rule that sought to curb exports of sophisticated AI chips by dividing the world into three tiers, with China blocked entirely. The Trump administration has said it is going to modify the rules.""All in all, the export control was a failure,"" Huang said adding, ""The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, in the first place, have been proven to be fundamentally flawed.""The U.S. block on sales of advanced AI chips to China has forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers such as Huawei, while also spurring China to invest aggressively to develop a supply chain that doesn't rely on manufacturers outside the country.The Nvidia chief executive said that despite the U.S. controls, research continues, which requires vast sums of capital to acquire the necessary AI infrastructure.At a press conference at the annual Computex event in Taipei, Huang praised Trump's approach to AI and said by reversing the prior restrictions, the president demonstrated he understands U.S. companies are not the only providers of such technology.""President Trump realises it's exactly the wrong goal,"" he said in reference to the prior rules.From the start of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, Nvidia's China market share has dropped to 50% from 95%, Huang said.Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach to chip export curbs and replacing it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, which could give the U.S. clout in trade talks. 'INTENSE' COMPETITION IN CHINAMore than half the world's AI researchers are based in China and because of the U.S. export controls on AI chips those experts have been forced to turn to local Chinese technology, Huang said.""Our competition in China is really intense,"" Huang said. ""They would love for us never to go back to China.""Huang estimated the entire AI market in China would be worth roughly $50 billion next year, which represented a significant opportunity for the company.At the Computex event, Nvidia announced several new technologies and businesses that will expand its $130.5 billion revenue. The company said in April it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the Trump administration limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.Earlier this week, Huang estimated that the H20-related revenue damage would amount to roughly $15 billion.But Nvidia is working on a version of its current-generation Blackwell AI chip that will include a less speedy form of memory to comply with restrictions on the typical advanced memory included on AI chips, according to two sources familiar with the matter.In 2022, the Biden administration effectively banned exports of advanced microchips and equipment to produce advanced chips by Chinese chipmakers, part of an effort to hobble China's semiconductor industry and in turn the military.After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips such as H20 that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.China on Monday urged the United States to ""immediately correct its wrongdoings"" and stop ""discriminatory"" measures following U.S. guidance warning companies not to use advanced computer chips from China, including Huawei's Ascend AI chips.The U.S. action seriously undermined consensus reached at the high-level bilateral trade talks in Geneva, a statement from China's commerce ministry said, vowing resolute measures if the U.S. continues to ""substantially"" harm China's interests.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT01X:0-nvidia-ceo-praises-trump-move-to-scrap-some-ai-export-curbs/"
"Nvidia Outlook in Focus Amid China Headwinds, Wedbush Says",1747927541000,"Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA ability to grow sales to offset the loss of H20 chip sales to China will be in focus when the company releases its Q1 results on May 28, Wedbush said in a report Thursday. ""The primary question around results and guidance is can NVDA lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20/China business,"" Wedbush analysts said. They said H20 demand was running ahead of expectations into early April when the US announced a ban on sales into China. They also said Blackwell, if anything, has ramped better than anticipated following some initial stumbles. ""We remain comfortable with our CQ1 and consensus estimates at $43B,"" the analysts said, adding that they were less certain about Q2 amid the loss of China sales. ""We also believe NVDA's Q2 revenue outlook matters less, as investors become more confident around NVDA's intermediate term growth outlook following recent announcements around planned AI data center investments,"" they said.

3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High,1747927320000,"The cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers.Bitcoin’s rally followed the U.S. equity market’s slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value.Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing.Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market.3 Crypto-Centric Stocks With UpsideVisa Inc.Visa is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement. In a move aimed at enhancing the efficiency of global transactions, V is expanding its stablecoin settlement capabilities to the high-performing Solana blockchain.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Sparks 'Jensanity' Frenzy in Taiwan During Computex Visit,1747778572000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) CEO Jensen Huang's return to Taiwan for the Computex trade show triggered massive public and media attention, with fans crowding events and officials responding to intense coverage.Revenue and valuation were not discussed in the report, but Nvidia's symbolic market presence loomed large during Huang's interactions with top executives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Local outlets dubbed the gathering the trillion dollar dinner, referencing the combined valuations of the companies in attendance.Fans shouted Huang's name, requested autographs, and received fried ice cream outside a Taipei restaurant. Nvidia capitalized on the popularity by launching a pop-up merchandise store featuring Huang-themed memorabilia.Security teams struggled to control the crowds, while Huang's U.S.-based peers expressed confusion at the celebrity status he commands in Taiwanespecially compared to his lower profile in the United States.Huang also made a high-profile appearance at the World Masters Games as a guest of honor alongside Olympic boxer Lin Yu-ting and actor Sylvia Chang. Political controversy briefly emerged after Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim's attendance was questioned as opportunistic. Her office denied prior knowledge of Huang's involvement.Following speculation in local media, Taiwan's transport ministry clarified that the cost to park Huang's private Bombardier jet at Songshan airport for six days was T$95,562 ($3,167).

President Trump's SALT Bill in Focus,1747926000000,"Well, all week we had been looking for a market catalyst, with economic prints scarce and Q1 earnings season winding down. We finally got it yesterday, with news that the “big, beautiful bill” was about to pass the House — that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk’s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending.However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1. This is before the Senate has gotten its hooks into the bill, and we know changes are going to be made. It has also gotten the attention of the bond market, which is now up over +4.6% on the 10-year, +4.0% on the 2-year and above +5.0% on the 30-year.The 20-year bond option yesterday triggered the mid-day sell-off. Major indexes fell from -1.4% (Nasdaq) to -1.9% (Dow) by yesterday’s close. This morning, we sank temporarily but are climbing at this hour: -120 points on the Dow, -5 on the S&P 500 and +15 points on the Nasdaq. The small-cap Russell 2000, which dropped -2.6% yesterday, is down another -10 points currently.Weekly Jobless Claims Stay In-RangeThankfully, this morning we do have economic reports to parse. Among them, like every normal Thursday, we see Initial Jobless Claims remaining in the groove with a healthy labor environment, at 227K — 2000 lower than the unrevised 229K reported for the previous week. Every several weeks or so we tend to see a pop above 240K, but always come back down in the subsequent prints.Continuing Claims came in at 1.903 million — above the psychological threshold of 1.9 million, but which has been revised down below it in all but one week of 2025 so far. This follows a downwardly revised 1.87 million from the prior week (these longer-term claims are reported a week behind initial claims). With aging workers taking their pink slips as a sign to call it a career, along with ex-federal employees currently living on severance packages, the long-awaited pressure on the labor market has been mild at worst to this point.Earnings Reports Ahead of Today’s Open: RL, BJThe parade of retailers reporting quarterly earnings continues this morning, with upscale retailer Ralph Lauren RL outpacing fiscal Q4 earnings estimates by 3 cents to $2.03 per share, on $1.70 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $1.63 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares are up modestly on the news, adding to the stock’s +18% gains year to date.Down the tax bracket a bit, BJ’s Wholesale BJ put up mixed numbers in its Q1 earnings report this morning. Earnings of $1.14 per share amounted to a nice beat on the bottom line, above the 91 cents analysts were expecting. Revenues, on the other hand, came in -0.5% from expectations to $5.15 billion. But reaffirming forward guidance has kept the stock up +2% this morning, adding to its +31% gains year to date.What to Expect in the Stock Market TodayAfter the opening bell, we’ll see S&P flash PMI for both Services and Manufacturing for the month of May. While both are expected to tick down a tad, Services is expected to remain above the 50-threshold (between growth and loss) and Manufacturing is anticipated to dip back below it.Existing Home Sales for April are expected to come in somewhat stronger: 4.13 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units versus 4.02 million posted a month ago. We have seen more homes come on line for sale of late, but off a very scarce base overall. New Home Sales, which come out tomorrow, are expected to slide back a bit.Also, earnings continues the final leg of its tour for the quarter, with Workday WDAY, AutoDesk ADSK and Deckers Outdoor DECK coming out with results after today’s close.

Foxconn to Build 100 MW AI Data Center With Nvidia (NVDA),1747778361000,"Foxconn said Tuesday it will develop a 100-megawatt AI data center with Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), with construction starting in phases across Taiwan. The project was announced during the Computex 2025 trade show in Taipei.The initial phase will begin with 20 MW of power in Kaohsiung, expanding to other locations based on local power capacity. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said the rollout will be gradual due to Taiwan's constrained energy resources. We know that power is a very critical resource in Taiwan, Liu said.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the project as an AI factory meant for use by Foxconn, Nvidia, and Taiwan's entire tech ecosystem. He noted Nvidia has over 350 local partners who will benefit from the infrastructure.The initiative is also backed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC, 2330.TW, Financials) and the Taiwanese government. The move comes amid rising global competition in AI and semiconductor infrastructure, positioning Taiwan to play a central role in next-gen compute capacity.Investors will be watching for updates on construction timelines, power allocation strategies, and downstream AI applications tied to the center's output.- Track NVDA financials. - See NVDA insider trades.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1bbecf51e094b:0-foxconn-to-build-100-mw-ai-data-center-with-nvidia-nvda/
Semtech to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards for the Stock?,1747924560000,"Semtech Corporation SMTC is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results after market close on May 27.For first-quarter fiscal 2026, Semtech expects net sales of $250 million (+/- $5 million), indicating 21% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $249.79 million, indicating a rise of 21.20% from the year-ago quarter.SMTC anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share to be 37 cents (+/- 3 cents). The consensus mark for the same is pegged at 38 cents, unchanged over the past 60 days, indicating a robust year-over-year improvement of 533%.Factors to Consider for SMTCSemtech’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strength across its infrastructure and high-end-consumer end markets. Similarly, the wireless end-market is likely to have witnessed strong growth owing to SMTC’s increasing 5G offerings. Continued growth in FiberEdge and Tri-Edge products, particularly for 400G/800G modules, is likely to boost the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Semtech Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Semtech Corporation price-eps-surprise | Semtech Corporation QuoteStrong Momentum across its Signal Integrity and Analog Mixed Signal & Wireless product lines is expected to have contributed well. The growing adoption of artificial intelligence might have been a plus for the upcoming quarter.Growing traction across hyperscale data center applications on the back of Tri-Edge and FiberEdge transimpedance amplifier products is expected to have aided SMTC’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The increasing demand for LoRa devices and LoRaWAN standards is expected to have contributed positively to top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The availability of its one-channel LoRaWAN hub reference design and evaluation kit targeting smaller-scale network deployments, such as for SMB/SME and smart home applications, is anticipated to impact its fourth-quarter results positively.However, Macroeconomic challenges, including the protracted inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates, are likely to have posed challenges for the company in the fiscal fourth quarter. Delayed adoption of CopperEdge products due to architectural changes in server racks is likely to affect SMTC’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 results.Additionally, escalating tensions between the United States and China might have raised concerns. Softness in the industrial end-market and the Connectivity segment is expected to have been a major negative.What Our Proven Model Says for SMTC’s Q1 EarningsAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Nvidia (NVDA) Ends Hopper AI Chip Line for China Amid U.S. Export Curbs,1747777272000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) is ending its Hopper AI chip series in China, with CEO Jensen Huang confirming the company will no longer modify the architecture to comply with U.S. export limits. A new downgraded chip is in the works as Nvidia seeks to retain footing in a critical growth market.Revenue from China totaled $17 billion in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2025, representing 13% of Nvidia's total sales. The H20 chip was the only remaining product in the Hopper series legally permitted for export to China under U.S. rules.Huang confirmed in a livestream that no further Hopper updates are possible, stating, It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore, according to Taiwan's Formosa TV.The company is expected to release a downgraded H20 chip within two months, according to earlier reports from Reuters, to help regain lost market share from competitors like Huawei.The Biden administration's Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, issued in January 2025, imposed new export restrictions, which have been criticized by Huang. He argued that the U.S. should focus on maximizing the global reach of its technologies rather than restricting exports.President Donald Trump has pledged to revoke those rules, calling them counterproductive to U.S. interests in global tech leadership.Huang visited China shortly after the H20 restrictions took effect, signaling Nvidia's ongoing commitment to the region despite tightened rules.- See insider trades for NVDA - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6ef65823d094b:0-nvidia-nvda-ends-hopper-ai-chip-line-for-china-amid-u-s-export-curbs/

"These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Moderna, Home Depot, Tesla, CATL, Nvidia, D-Wave Quantum, Viking Holdings, and More — Barrons.com",1747772880000,"By Joe Woelfel, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Connor SmithStocks fell Tuesday, as the S&P 500 snapped its six-day winning streak in a slow day for the market.These stocks were making moves:Moderna rose 6.1%. The Food and Drug Administration will stick to its existing process for updating Covid-19 shots for older adults and those at a high risk of severe illness. It's a softer approach than Trump officials had seemed poised to take, according to Barron's reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis.Home Depot, the biggest home-improvement retailer, reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.56 a share, missing analysts' estimates of $3.60. Revenue of $39.9 billion beat forecasts of $39.3 billion. The company said it plans to keep prices unchanged despite new tariffs. Home Depot shares were down 0.6%. Competitor Lowe's, which reports quarterly earnings Wednesday, fell 1.4%.Tesla was up 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk told a conference in Qatar that he expects to still be chief executive in five years, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla shares have declined 15% this year but have jumped about 44% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 22. Tesla sold 11,150 cars in China the past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung, up from 3,040 sold the week before. But that is down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Shares of Tesla supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology, the Chinese battery giant, soared 16% in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday. CATL raised almost $4.6 billion in the world's largest equity offering this year.UnitedHealth gained 1.8%. The shares rose 8.2% on Monday, ending the session at $315.89. It was the stock's largest daily percentage increase since Nov 4, 2020, when it rose more than 10%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock declined 23.3% last week after UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty resigned and the company suspended its 2025 outlook.Nvidia fell 0.9%. CEO Jensen Huang said Monday the company would be opening its artificial-intelligence server platform to rival chip makers but he also warned the U.S. government's move to limit chip exports to China could hit revenue by $15 billion.D-Wave Quantum jumped 26% as its sixth-generation quantum-computing system became available over the cloud. D-Wave management highlighted the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines effectively can handle.Amer Sports rose 19% after the sporting goods and apparel company topped first-quarter adjusted earnings estimates and raised fiscal-year profit guidance.Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained 1.5% to $17.72 after analysts at Evercore ISI upgraded shares of the technology company to Outperform from In Line and raised their price target to $22 from $17.Viking Holdings, the expedition cruises company, reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss on a revenue jump of 25% to $897.1 million. The company said it was seeing ""sustained strength in demand."" Shares, however, declined 5% as analysts questioned whether Viking will be able to sustain pricing growth as the year progresses. Cruise line peers also declined. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings was off 3.9%, Carnival fell 2.1%, and Royal Caribbean was down 1.9%.Earnings reports were expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies, and Toll Brothers.Write to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

German chipmaker Infineon to work with Nvidia on power delivery chips ,1747767578000,"German chipmaker Infineon XETR:IFX said on Tuesday it will work with Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA on developing chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centers.Infineon said it will work with Nvidia to develop high-voltage, direct current power delivery systems. In current data centers, most high-voltage power is distributed as alternating current and then converted to the direct current needed by computer chips by individual power supply units inside of servers. But that method of distributing power introduces losses in moving power around and converting it. With each server rack within AI data centers expected to take a megawatt of power by the end of the decade, Infineon and Nvidia said they are hoping to reduce those losses by creating a centralized direct-current distribution system. “Through this innovative approach, Nvidia is able to optimize the energy consumption of our advanced AI infrastructure, which supports our commitment to sustainability while also delivering the performance and scalability required for the next generation of AI workloads,” Gabriele Gorla, vice president of system engineering at Nvidia, said in a statement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RS0Q4:0-german-chipmaker-infineon-to-work-with-nvidia-on-power-delivery-chips/"

The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics ,1747763100000,"Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we’ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the “World’s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.”As this trend gains traction, it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we’ll explore four stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), the Global X Robotics & AI ETF (BOTZ) and Tesla (TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolutionGrowth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it’s a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world’s most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla’s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia ,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia’s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank’s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don’t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfd373905094b:0-the-next-major-tech-stock-trend-humanoid-robotics/
'Stargate UAE' AI datacenter to begin operation in 2026,1747922400000,"The first phase of a massive new artificial data center in the United Arab Emirates will come online in 2026, likely with 100,000 Nvidia chips.The ""Stargate UAE"" project is part of a deal brokered last week by U.S. President Donald Trump to build the world's largest set of AI data centers outside the United States, despite previous U.S. restrictions on sending advanced technology to the UAE because of its close ties to China.The 10-square-mile (26-sq-km) site in Abu Dhabi will eventually host 5 gigawatts worth of data centers.The first phase of that project will be the 1-gigawatt Stargate UAE project, built by state-backed UAE firm G42 in partnership with U.S. firms OpenAI, Oracle NYSE:ORCL , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Cisco Systems NASDAQ:CSCO , as well as Japan's SoftBank Group TSE:9984 . The companies on Thursday said that the Stargate UAE project will use Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, currently the most advanced AI server that Nvidia offers.The first 200 megawatts of capacity will go live in 2026, the companies said. The group did not give a number of servers, but analyst firm TrendForce estimates that GB300 servers with 72 chips each consume about 140-kilowatts of power, which equates to about 1,400 servers or 100,000 Nvidia chips.This first-in-the-world platform will enable every UAE government agency and commercial institution to connect their data to the world's most advanced AI models,"" Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief technology officer and chairman, said in a statement.The Trump administration earlier this month rescinded a rule put in place by President Joe Biden that would have restricted the flow of AI chips to countries such as the UAE. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has not said what will replace the rule but said last week that it will convene a working group between the U.S. and UAE to ensure that the project meets ""robust U.S. security standards and other efforts to responsibly deploy AI infrastructure, both in the UAE and globally.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RT0Y9:0-stargate-uae-ai-datacenter-to-begin-operation-in-2026/"
"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.""We see Nvidia's leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,"" the analysts said.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

NVIDIA vs. Super Micro: Which AI Hardware Stock Should You Bet On?,1747747080000,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has ignited a race among hardware suppliers, and two of the most prominent names riding this wave are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI. NVIDIA dominates the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market, while Super Micro rides the same wave by designing ultra-efficient, NVIDIA’s chip-optimized servers for hyperscalers and enterprises.Both stocks have delivered exceptional returns, but which is the better bet now? Let’s break down their fundamentals, valuation, growth outlook and looming risks to find out which one is a better investment option today.NVDA: The AI Chip Giant With DominanceNVIDIA is an undisputed leader in AI chips, data centers, gaming and autonomous vehicles. Its products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. Revenues from this end-market surged 93% year over year to $35.58 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.NVIDIA’s latest earnings call underscored the company’s continued AI dominance. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the increasing demand for next-generation AI models that require unprecedented computational power. The company’s Blackwell architecture, capable of delivering up to 25 times the token throughput of its predecessor, is expected to drive the next wave of AI adoption.Further bolstering its leadership, NVIDIA is set to launch its Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platforms, which could solidify its position as the go-to AI infrastructure provider. With governments, corporations and cloud providers ramping up AI investments, NVIDIA remains the key beneficiary of this seismic shift in computing.However, the recent restrictions imposed by the Trump administration on exporting H20 chips to China are likely to hurt NVIDIA’s overall financial growth in the near term. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently stated that export restrictions on H20 chips have cost the company $15 billion in sales and expects approximately $5.5 billion in charges due to the ban in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.Despite the headwinds, NVIDIA is anticipated to remain on a high-growth trajectory. The company expects revenues of $43 billion (+/-2%) in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, indicating a year-over-year growth of more than 65%.SMCI: A High-Risk, High-Reward AI Infrastructure PlaySuper Micro Computer’s growth is driven by the need for AI workloads. As a growing number of data centers are proliferating and existing ones are expanding their capacity, the need for SMCI’s high-performance and energy-efficient servers is rising.Super Micro Computer’s liquid-cooled and modular servers are a hit among cloud service providers, government customers and enterprises as these servers possess the capacity to handle AI at scale. SMCI has further strengthened its AI expertise by collaborating with NVIDIA and integrating its Blackwell GPUs for high compute power.Despite the massive potential of Super Micro Computer’s server offerings, the company is facing some near-term challenges, including delayed purchasing decisions from customers as they are evaluating the adoption of next-generation AI platforms. SMCI is also facing margin contraction due to the growing price competition and price adjustments as companies are second-guessing their shift from older to newer platforms like Blackwell.In the last reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Super Micro Computer also incurred a one-time inventory write-down on older-generation GPUs and related components, further affecting its margins. Based on all the above factors, SMCI revised the revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 from the $23.5-$25.0 billion range to a range of $21.8 billion-$22.6 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: NVDA Stays Less Volatile Than SMCIThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Super Micro Computer’s fiscal 2025 EPS indicates a year-over-year decline of 6%, while that for fiscal 2026 signifies growth of 36%. The earnings estimate revision trend for the two fiscals has remained highly volatile over the last 60 days.SMCI Earnings Estimate Revision TrendThe consensus mark for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 43% and 27%, respectively. Also, the earnings estimate revision trend for the stock has remained more stable compared with a highly volatile trend for SMCI. This stability is a testament to NVDA’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.NVDA Earnings Estimate Revision TrendNVDA vs. SMCI: Price Performance & Valuation CheckBoth companies have seen share price fluctuations over the past year amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While NVDA shares have soared 42.8% over the past year, SMCI dropped 50.6%.Valuation-wise, both NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer are trading at earnings multiples below their respective industry averages. However, NVDA’s current price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29.25X is significantly lower than the one-year median of 37.28X. On the other hand, SMCI’s P/E multiple of 16.41X is slightly higher than the one-year median of 16.10X.While SMCI appears cheaper on a P/E basis, it comes with significantly more volatility and execution risk.Conclusion: NVIDIA is the Better AI Hardware Bet Right NowWhile both NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer are important players in the AI revolution, NVIDIA clearly stands out as the stronger investment today.NVIDIA’s dominant market position, product innovation and earnings consistency make it the AI infrastructure stock of choice. Despite geopolitical challenges, the company is still expected to deliver blockbuster growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond, driven by its next-generation Blackwell architecture and robust customer demand.Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer is more of a high-risk, high-reward satellite play. It remains a compelling company with niche strengths, but its exposure to product cycles, customer hesitation and margin pressure makes its near-term outlook more uncertain.Furthermore, NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, making the stock a stronger pick compared with SMCI, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:16898bb2a094b:0-nvidia-vs-super-micro-which-ai-hardware-stock-should-you-bet-on/
Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The AI Diffusion Rule is Over. What That Means for Trump and China. — Barrons.com,1747747020000,"By Justin ShermanAbout the author: Justin Sherman is the founder and CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, a research and advisory firm, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.In a major trade and security pivot, President Donald Trump has scrapped his predecessor's so-called artificial intelligence diffusion rule that was set to be implemented last week. That rule, signed by President Joe Biden in his final days in office, added export controls on integrated circuits and AI models to countries such as China and Iran — with big exemptions for friendly nations such as Germany. Some U.S. AI and chip companies are cheering on this reversal, their present view reflecting that of a Commerce Department spokesperson: Biden's AI rule was ""overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation.""At face value, it seems the leading industry players and the U.S. government are on the same page: Companies want to build and sell chips and AI products globally, and the administration wants U.S. industry to boom. Both worry about Beijing's AI capabilities and threats to U.S. national security. Same talk, same page.But many chip and AI companies' talk about national security and China is more or less just that — talk. For some firms, talking about China and national security is simply a way to frame their own priorities, such as relaxing export controls or building data centers, in terms that land well with the current top policymakers. It seems like talking about Biden's diffusion rule as overly burdensome for companies — and therefore bad for national security — worked.When the rubber meets the road, however, AI and chip companies may not like the Trump administration's hawkish position on China, and the administration may not like companies' true views on national security issues. Whatever replaces the AI diffusion rule will expose those critical tensions.These commercial AI and national security concerns have been brewing under the surface for months. In 2024, many AI companies were trying to present themselves as moving in lockstep with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China. But the Biden administration's domestic work on trustworthy AI certainly caused friction with industry — particularly for those who would rather do away with safeguards. And some began whittling away at the national security narrative.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in July 2024 that closing off U.S. AI systems to China would be a mistake, as America's advantage comes from openness and fewer controls. Framed in the context of helping national security, the anti-regulatory argument spoke to a bigger policy concern: China. OpenAI, shortly thereafter, pitched the administration on a massive data center buildout, likewise framed as key to geopolitical competition. This kind of rhetoric, speaking to fears of ""falling behind"" in what many reductively call the ""AI race,"" also found a receptive audience in Washington. Biden started to put his executive order on data centers in motion.The apparent alignment between the government and commercial chip and AI firms changed with the flick of a pen. When the Biden team published the AI diffusion rule on Jan. 13, the backlash was swift from companies that were, a moment ago, speaking as if they backed the president's national security rationale.Nvidia released a statement that day calling the rule a misguided, unprecedented effort that ""threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide"" and ""squander America's hard-won technological advantage."" The rule is ""cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, "" but ""would do nothing to enhance U.S. security.""That rhetoric evidently worked on the new administration — and the benefits shortly flowed to investors. The day after Trump nixed the diffusion rule, Nvidia's stock rose 4.4%. AMD's stock rose 3.4%. But ditching Biden's order is a temporary resolve between these commercial and national security tensions, likely to be disrupted when the Trump administration rolls out the rule's replacement.A replacement program could relax chip and AI model technology exports to some countries favored by Trump, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and hugely ramp up limits for China. That will prompt industry concerns for chip companies wanting to sell in China and to maintain certain China-based supply chain points. Or a new program could soften restrictions below a certain compute or model performance threshold, but broadly curb exports of higher-end technologies in ways that impact a different vertical of industry sales.As a general rule, export restrictions focused on national security are going to both limit companies' overseas market opportunities and speak to issues that aren't companies' bread and butter. Just as some investment firms are skeptical of inbound and outbound investment screening, some leading chip and AI companies are unlikely to truly buy into the scope and degree of national security concerns about exports to China.So administration officials — particularly those most hawkish on Beijing — may find themselves in direct confrontation with chip and AI companies that are keen on continuing to sell high-end chips to Chinese buyers. The administration's concerns about AI diffusion to China through third countries may also conflict with companies that feel even countries with close ties to China aren't in fact China — and therefore aren't a risk. Officials could even encounter the same amount of pushback and criticism on a more relaxed export rule than the Biden administration faced on its more sweeping one. After all, the psychological treadmill kicks in, and even a more moderate set of rules will still raise the regulatory floor — and demand higher compliance costs and impact bottom lines.This isn't to say every chip and AI company is crying ""national security"" just to get on policymakers' calendars. Plenty of chip and AI companies build tech entirely or primarily for national security use cases. Some major AI vendors, such as Anthropic, supported the AI diffusion rule with tweaks. Last month, Anthropic said stronger export controls on chips were necessary to keep a competitive lead over China.It is healthy for commercial enterprises to have a range of views on geopolitical and national security issues, especially in a volatile global trade and geopolitical environment.But as the administration talks genuinely about the country's AI advantage over China, these tensions under the surface will bubble up again. Companies will have to navigate more uncertainty and new national security guidelines. And policymakers may have to confront public-private differences of opinion on China head-on.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

"Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after US export curbs, sources say",1748088000000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's TWSE:2330 advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported. The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market."" TSMC declined to comment.MARKET SHARE PLUNGE China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name.Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei (HWT.UL) which produces the Ascend 910B chip.Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU045:0-nvidia-to-launch-cheaper-blackwell-ai-chip-for-china-after-us-export-curbs-sources-say/"

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: NVIDIA, Taiwan Semiconductor, Oracle and CoreWeave",1747744260000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights NVIDIA NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Oracle ORCL and CoreWeave CRWV.NVIDIA ""AI Factories"": More Than Just Clever Marketing?NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor , Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA's Santa Clara office ""launching"" into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA's growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA's ecosystem partners and described the industry's opportunity as ""extraordinary"" and ""once in a lifetime.""""We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,"" he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his ""AI Factory"" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about ""AI Factories"" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: ""massively parallel architectures.""I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled ""Get Your MPA in Deep Learning."" Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or ""in parallel,"" without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the ""MPAs"" faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these ""intelligence"" possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle CEO Larry Ellison mused last year ""We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more.""The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen's long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse ""digital twins"" to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between ""agentic AI"" and ""physical AI"" is mind-blowing. Agents are ""essentially digital robots,"" Huang said, able to ""perceive, understand and plan."" To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world's most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night...""AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,"" Huang said. ""These factories are essentially what we build today.""""They're not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.""I admit, ""tokens"" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink ""spine"" and said ""This moves more traffic than the entire Internet.""NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave , Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he's not talking about Bitcoin.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Nvidia: Top Analyst Calls May 28 Earnings a 'Positive Clearing Event',1747916122000,"May 22 - Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA is set to report Q1 FY26 results on May 28, offering investors a chance to reassess growth drivers and ease lingering concerns.Cantor Fitzgerald's C.J. Muse, who carries an Overweight rating and $200 price target, expects earnings of $0.88 per share on revenue of $43.26 billion. He calls the upcoming call a likely positive clearing event.Despite anticipated headwinds in China, Muse projects July-quarter revenue of about $46 billion, just shy of the $46.3 billion Wall Street consensus, factoring in a $15 billion hit from H20 chip restrictions and solid early demand for Blackwell chips.He sees a meaningful ramp in GB300 shipments starting in Q4, with roughly 25,000 units shipping in 2025, and forecasts Data Center revenue climbing toward $200 billion next year, up from a $175 billion estimate.Looking beyond the quarter, Muse expects management to maintain a positive tone on AI spending, peg second-half gross margins in the mid-70s, and spotlight emerging areas such as AI factories and Physical AI.On valuation, Nvidia trades at 26.8 times projected 2025 earnings and 19.9 times 2026 estimates, suggesting room for upside as profit growth accelerates.Is NVDA a 'Buy' Before Earnings?Based on the one year price targets offered by 51 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $163.81 with a high estimate of $235.92 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +24.29% from the current price of $131.80.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:62af6a86c094b:0-nvidia-top-analyst-calls-may-28-earnings-a-positive-clearing-event/
Nvidia's Jensen Huang Is Now a Geopolitical Superstar. It Comes With Risks. — WSJ,1747743420000,"By Liza Lin and Raffaele HuangTAIPEI — The American president called him ""my friend,"" Saudi Arabia bought hundreds of thousands of his chips and, in the land of his birth, he was hailed as ""the leader of team Taiwan.""With a visit to Taipei this week, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang capped a whirlwind month of travel that marked him as not just a business tycoon, but one of the world's most powerful geopolitical forces.Everyone wants a piece of the charismatic CEO and his coveted chips, seen as the gold standard for advanced artificial-intelligence computing. Investors celebrated his global coming-out party by pushing Nvidia shares up 40% over the past month. The stock's swoon in January is a distant memory and the company, with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, is again within striking distance of global No. 1.But international fame carries risks too — Huang does business in sensitive regions such as China and the Persian Gulf states.""His fortune and misfortune is that he created the most valuable technological input of the decade,"" said Barath Harithas, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The danger is that his visibility becomes a liability. He could end up the fall guy if things unravel in the Gulf, and then face political heat for any perceived overreach in China.""Huang's processors and investment spending have the power to change countries' fates, and the 62-year-old billionaire has himself been changed by his power. He has donned a business suit and tie for meetings with world leaders, shedding his customary leather jacket, and added praise for politicians to his salesman's patter about tokens and terabytes.""Without the president's leadership, his policies, his support and, very importantly, his strong encouragement,"" Huang said while standing beside President Trump at the White House on April 30, ""frankly, manufacturing in the United States wouldn't have accelerated to this pace.""Trump returned the favor two weeks later by giving a shout out to the CEO in a speech in Saudi Arabia. ""I see my friend is here, Jensen, that's very good,"" Trump said. ""He's putting in $500 billion,"" the president went on, referring to Nvidia's commitment to build AI supercomputers in the U.S.Since mid-April, Huang has been flying across the world, unveiling new investments and striking deals. In the Middle East last week, Huang met Saudi Arabia's crown prince and agreed to sell Nvidia's powerful AI processors to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.In Taiwan this week, the location of Nvidia's most important suppliers, Huang drew loud cheers and praise from the island's president when he announced on Monday the construction of a new Nvidia office building and plans for Taiwan's first AI supercomputer.Crowds and rock star-like excitement followed his every step. Huang, a U.S. citizen, was born on the island before moving to the U.S. as a child.When Huang was due to turn up at an Nvidia partner's booth at an industry conference on Tuesday, hordes of fans started to gather at the venue as early as an hour ahead. As he walked toward the booth, fans began pressing against the barricades, calling out ""Jensen, I love you!"" and reaching out to touch the executive.In a speech, Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn, called Huang ""the leader of team Taiwan"" for his efforts to build up Taiwan's AI industry.In return, Huang called Taiwan the ""epicenter of the world's computing industry.""Huang has pulled off the feat of staying friends with both the U.S. and China, despite tensions between the two superpowers.In early April, he attended a $1 million-a-head dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and afterward some inside Nvidia were confident the company could keep selling its H20 chips in China, which had been tailored to comply with earlier U.S. regulations. Instead, the U.S. said a few days later it would restrict the sale of the H20 chips, which led Nvidia to take a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter.Within days of the new rule, Huang flew to Beijing and publicly reassured senior Chinese officials the company would ""unwaveringly serve"" the market there. Later, he met the mayor of Shanghai and left with the city's blessing to open a new research and development center there.Huang has repeatedly said China will be a powerhouse in global AI development and it would be folly for Nvidia to neglect the market. Each time new U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors have been introduced, Nvidia has adapted by downgrading its chips' specs to continue selling to Chinese customers.Lian Jye Su, an analyst at Omdia covering AI, said Nvidia was trying to avoid picking sides between the U.S. and China.""Nvidia doesn't have the luxury of staying neutral, and can only try its best to minimize the political fallout,"" Su added.Last week, the Commerce Department put out guidance against the use of American AI chips to train Chinese models and warned against the diversion of such silicon to China.Harithas of CSIS said the perception of an American executive courting China ran against sentiment in Washington. ""If he leans too far toward China with even a neutered chip variant, he risks crossing a red line, triggering public rebuke, or worse, legal blowback,"" he said.Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com and Raffaele Huang at raffaele.huang@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250520004513:0/
How CoreWeave Stock Became a $2 Billion Win for Nvidia — Barron's,1748050200000,"Ed LinNvidia may be best known for artificial-intelligence chips, but the company hasn't been a slouch in some of its investing activity. An early stake in a hot stock has paid off enormously.In April 2023, Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, long before that cloud provider's initial public offering this March. The 17.9 million preferred CoreWeave shares Nvidia purchased, at $5.58 each, were converted into an equivalent amount of common shares with the IPO. Nvidia invested another $250 million in CoreWeave's IPO, paying $40 a share for 6.25 million more shares.All told, as of the end of March, Nvidia owned 24.2 million CoreWeave shares, a 7% stake, according to a form Nvidia filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using a recent trading price of $83.42 — already more than double the $40 IPO price — that stake is valued at $2.02 billion, a paper profit of $1.67 billion on the $350 million Nvidia paid.Nvidia declined to comment. It referred Barron's to CoreWeave's regulatory filings.CoreWeave is a pure play on AI. All of its revenue comes from cloud-based rentals of AI servers that use Nvidia chips.In April 2023, the same month Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, the two companies reached a master services agreement for CoreWeave to provide Nvidia with infrastructure and platform services. Through the end of 2024, Nvidia had paid CoreWeave about $320 million under the pact.Inside Scoop is a regular Barron's feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members — so-called insiders — as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.

"High-Yield ETFs: Big Payouts, Bigger Trade-Offs?",1747743240000,"While a significant amount of money continues to flow into low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs, the ETF universe is becoming increasingly complex. Most new ETFs being launched are actively managed, and many make use of derivatives.Two recent regulatory changes—the “ETF Rule” and the “Derivatives Rule”—have made it easier for providers to launch ETFs and incorporate derivatives into their strategies. The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking.Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:Buffer or defined outcome ETFsLeveraged or inverse single-stock ETFsOption-based income ETFsSome of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs. (See: Buffer ETFs Attract Billions as Investors Seek Shelter from Market Turmoil)This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts.We analyzed the performance of 24 single-stock covered call ETFs in the YieldMax suite from their respective inception dates. We focused on YieldMax because it is the clear leader in this niche, significantly ahead of competitors despite a recent surge in similar offerings.Many of YieldMax’s ETFs launched in 2023—providing a limited, yet more substantial, performance history compared to most rivals, which are even newer.Despite their eye-popping distribution rates, these products tend to underperform on a total return basis due to steep declines in share price. Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, only two managed to slightly outperform their respective underlying stocks.Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy WorksYieldMax currently offers 48 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of over $10 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market.According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap.These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income.To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spread strategies to further enhance yields.The YieldMax Reddit community has around 44,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income.The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums—and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM.Yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly payout and dividing it by the fund’s latest NAV. However, yields can vary significantly from month to month as income from selling options depends on fluctuations in the underlying stock, implied volatility, and other factors.Performance Since InceptionWe analyzed the total return—including distributions—of 24 YieldMax single-stock ETFs from their inception versus their respective underlying stocks. Some stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat—but in all cases except those tracking PayPal PYPL and Marathon Digital MARA, the ETF underperformed the stock.For the four most popular products, the performance gap was substantial—showing that investors may be leaving a lot of money on the table in pursuit of yield.YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY )The most popular product in the suite celebrated its one-year anniversary in February and now boasts $4 billion in assets. It is also the highest-yielding single-stock ETF in the lineup, offering a distribution rate of 136%. Since inception, it has delivered a total return of 286%, while MSTR stock has surged 457% during the same period.Once a little-known, money-losing software firm, Strategy MSTR has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and now trades like a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. Its stock commands a significant premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings.Some experts believe the financial engineering behind MSTY—and the premium valuation—may be unsustainable. If you're bullish on bitcoin, why not consider the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which charges just 0.25% and closely tracks the price of the asset?TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY)The oldest product in the suite holds $1.2 billion in assets. Since its debut in November 2022, the ETF has gained approximately 22%—significantly underperforming Tesla TSLA shares, which are up about 102% over the same period. It has also lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, which have gained 53% and 85%, respectively.For context, low-cost index funds like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM charge just 0.02% and 0.15% in fees, while most option income products charge close to 1%. TSLY currently boasts a striking yield of nearly 107%.NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY )The second most popular product in the family has generated a total return of about 187% since its inception in May 2023. However, shares of the AI darling NVIDIA NVDA have risen approximately 372% over the same period. Still, the ETF has attracted $1.3 billion in assets.YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY )CONY, which tracks Coinbase COIN—a major beneficiary of bitcoin’s rise—has returned 120% since its debut in August 2023. Over the same period, COIN stock has gained about 209%. The ETF currently sports a yield of 97% and has about $1.1 billion in assets.Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFsThese ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price. In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if the stock falls—creating an asymmetric risk-reward profile.By contrast, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI—which helped launch the covered call trend—uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of about 125 stocks. (Read: What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?)The fund then sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate monthly income. This portfolio doesn’t experience the outsized moves seen in names like Strategy or Coinbase, which explains why the performance shortfall may not be too striking.Bottom LineYou should only invest in a fund tied to a single stock if you're bullish on that specific name—in which case, you're generally better off owning the stock directly. If you expect the stock to decline, it’s best to steer clear of any product linked to it.These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound. However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don’t expect jumbo distributions.If you’re drawn to high monthly income and can accept an asymmetric risk-reward profile—as well as potentially unfavorable and inconsistent tax treatment—these funds may still appeal to you.ETFs have democratized access to markets, and innovation in the space has been remarkable. But with complex products like these, it’s essential for investors to fully understand how they work—and what outcomes are realistic.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ab88debad094b:0-high-yield-etfs-big-payouts-bigger-trade-offs/
How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/

Cadence Rises 27% in a Month: How Should You Play the Stock?,1747740720000,"Cadence Design Systems CDNS stock surged 27.3% in the past month, outperforming the Computer-Software industry, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite’s growth of 25.3%, 22.6% and 15.3%, respectively.Price PerformanceThe trigger has been the company’s stellar first-quarter results, with the stock gaining 12% since April 28. The stock closed last trading session at $320.30 and is now much closer to its 52-week high of $328.99. So, the question now arises is whether to stay invested or pull out? Can the stock rally further? Let us analyze the stock in detail to ascertain if it is worth investment consideration.CDNS Boasts Strong FundamentalsBroad-based demand for its solutions amid robust design activity is a key catalyst. Secular trends like 5G, increasing usage of hyperscale computing and autonomous driving are influencing design activity across semiconductor and systems companies. This is likely to open up opportunities for its end-to-end EDA, IP and systems solutions. The focus on Generative AI, Agentic AI and Physical AI is leading to an exponential increase in computing demand and semiconductor innovation. This bodes well for Cadence.To capitalize on this opportunity, it has been collaborating with several tech giants, including Qualcomm and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, on their next-generation AI designs across both training and inference. The company also expanded its partnership with NVIDIA for the latter’s Grace Blackwell architecture to accelerate computing and agentic AI solutions. It is among the first adopters of the NVIDIA Omniverse blueprint for AI-factory digital twins, which will augment data center design and operations. Cadence is eyeing new AI markets like Life Sciences through its OpenEye drug discovery software. The company is also expanding partnerships with its foundry partners like Taiwian Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel and Arm Holdings.Amid rapid AI proliferation, the Cadence.ai portfolio has been gaining momentum along with AI-powered products such as Cadence Cerebrus. The product had more than 1000 tapeouts year to date and 50 new logos in the first quarter. Going ahead, the company is likely to benefit from customers increasing their R&D spending in AI-driven automation. On the last earnings call, Cadence highlighted that it has not seen any shifts in customers’ behavior presently, as they continue to invest in next-generation designs.Cadence continues to invest heavily in verification and digital design products, which is helping it to launch products that address the ever-growing needs of electronics and semiconductor companies. The company’s verification business has been gaining traction due to the rising complexity of system verification and software bring-up.In April 2024, the company unveiled the latest Palladium Z3 Emulation and Protium X3 FPGA Prototyping systems. This is an advanced digital twin platform that is aimed at addressing the growing complexity of system and semiconductor design. The latest systems offer more than double the capacity and a significant performance increase compared with Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 systems. In 2024, hardware solutions added more than 30 customers and almost 200 repeat customers, especially among AI and hyperscale clients.The strategic acquisition plan has played a pivotal part in developing the company’s business in the last few years. To strengthen its IP business, the company announced the acquisition of Secure-IC, which will expand its IP portfolio, including interface, memory, AI and DSP solutions. In April 2025, Cadence signed a definitive agreement with Arm Holdings to acquire its Artisan foundation IP business. The acquisition includes a suite of standard cell libraries, memory compilers and general-purpose I/Os, all finely tuned for advanced process nodes at leading global foundries.CDNS’ Robust OutlookDriven by strong results, management upgraded its outlook for 2025. Revenues for 2025 are now estimated to be in the range of $5.15-$5.23 billion compared with $5.14-$5.22 billion guided earlier. Non-GAAP EPS for 2025 is expected to be between $6.73 and $6.83 compared with $6.65-$6.75 guided earlier.Challenges Loom Ahead for CDNSWeakness prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions and substantial exposure to the semiconductor vertical are concerning. Any reduction in R&D spending for companies within the semiconductor sector could affect CDNS' top-line performance.Higher operating costs and stiff competition in the EDA/AI space from the likes of Keysight Technologies, Synopsys SNPS and ANSYS ANSS are additional headwinds. The pending acquisition of ANSYS by Synopsys is likely to intensify competition in the EDA space for all players. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025.While Cadence is expanding aggressively through M&A, acquisitions may distract from core performance if integration falls short or synergies do not materialize as expected, which could weigh on margins.CDNS' Premium Valuation & Estimate RevisionCadence stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 45.04X compared with the industry’s 32.02X. In comparison, SNPS and ANSS trade at multiples of 32.16 and 28.01, respectively.Analysts remain bearish on the stock, as evident from the downward estimate revision in the past 60 days.Conclusion: Hold CDNS Despite HeadwindsCadence, with its strong fundamentals, robust AI-driven demand and a resilient recurring revenue model, remains a compelling opportunity. The company’s prominent position in the EDA space and strategic partnerships with tech giants like NVIDIA and Qualcomm position it well for long-term growth. While macro uncertainty, integration risks and valuation are valid concerns, the company's upgraded guidance and expanding market footprint support a continued bullish outlook. Given the strong momentum and secular tailwinds, holding the stock remains a prudent strategy for long-term investors.CDNS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see t he complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Income Investing: Options Can Be a Source Of Cash — or Information — Barron's,1748050200000,"They can be a source of cash or a source of information. By Al RootIncome investors usually want to keep it simple, and stock options are anything but. They can still be a useful tool, however, especially when pondering the safety of a dividend.That's not the first thing that people typically think of when they contemplate stock options. Though they're often viewed as synonymous with speculation, they can also hedge positions, provide portfolio income, and gauge the potential size of stock moves around significant events such as earnings.Options, as their name suggests, give the holder the ""option"" to buy or sell a stock at a fixed price in the future. Call options give the right to buy a stock, while put options grant the right to sell. How does that work? Let's say investors think Nvidia stock will go up. They could buy shares for a recent $132, and wait. If the stock trades to $240, they would make about 82%.But for $10, investors who believe that Nvidia stock is heading higher can purchase a call option on the stock that gives them the right to buy the shares for $200 each in about one year. If the stock trades up to $240 in a year, they would then execute the option, take ownership of the stock for $200, and then sell it for $240, giving them a gain of $30 — they paid $10 for the option — or 300% on their initial investment. Of course, an option can be an all-or-nothing bet. If Nvidia stock closes below $200 in a year, the $10 disappears.Investors don't need to buy and sell options for them to be useful. Options can also tell investors a lot about the safety of the dividends for the stocks they own, says Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics, a 27-year-old research firm. That's a valuable tool these days, considering the volatility induced by trade wars, geopolitics, and recession fears.The math to determine dividend direction can get complicated. Options prices reflect a lot of factors simultaneously, including a stock's expected volatility, the time to expiration, the level of interest rates, and, yes, dividend payments. Traders have to account for all of these when figuring out what to pay for an option, and if all other factors are controlled for, it's possible to see what traders are predicting for the dividend.They're not always right. After Covid-19 crushed markets in early 2020, options prices for Philip Morris International reflected a dividend cut. The cut never arrived. Instead, the company raised its dividend about 3% that year. More recently, markets took a dip around President Donald Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day,"" as investors worried that high tariff rates and an escalating trade war would create a Covid-like market crisis. The Cboe Volatility index — better known as the VIX — spiked from less than 20 shortly before the announcement to more than 50 in early April. Despite the volatility, options on Philip Morris, which yields 3.1%, never reflected a dividend cut after the tariff announcements, says DeSimone.Philip Morris is known for the safety of its dividend, but what about some others with high yields that appear increasingly uncertain? DeSimone looked at chemical makers Dow and LyondellBasell Industries, which yield 9.3% and 9%, respectively, and food company Kraft Heinz, which has a 5.7% payout, and found that the options market isn't implying a dividend cut in their futures. There's no guarantee that the companies won't cut their dividends. Dow and Lyondell have been suffering from depressed earnings and cash flow resulting from falling chemical prices amid weak global demand . Kraft, for its part, hasn't grown earnings for a decade and recently announced a strategic review to boost lagging performance.Those situations have made investors nervous. The options analysis, however, suggests that there's reason for optimism. For income investors, it's a place to start.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522002520:0/

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/

Arbe Announces Q1 2025 Financial Results,1747738800000,"TEL AVIV, Israel, May 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Arbe Robotics Ltd. NASDAQ:ARBE TASE:ARBE (""Arbe""), a global leader in perception radar solutions, today announced financial results for its first quarter, which ended March 31, 2025.Scaling Up Toward High-Volume Production:- Arbe made significant progress toward design wins with leading European OEMs, securing orders for radar systems to support advanced data collection programs. The OEMs' data collection program is one of the final steps in the automotive sourcing process. The company expects that its radar technology will serve as a key enabler for high volume 2028 passenger vehicle platforms, with revenue projected to begin in 2027. Arbe's strong financial position is expected to support the program's execution.- In April, HiRain Technologies, Arbe's Tier 1 in China, launched a production-intent long-range imaging radar system, the LRR615, powered by Arbe's high-performance chipset. Engineered for ultra-high resolution and reliable performance in all weather and lighting conditions, the LRR615 is tailored for the Chinese autonomous driving market and marks a pivotal step toward industrial-scale deployment.- Sensrad, Arbe's Tier 1 for non-automotive sectors, placed an order for over a thousand imaging radar chips to serve multiple customers across a range of applications, underscoring both confidence in the platform and growing commercial traction. These developments reflect tangible progress toward an expected launch of the Sensrad radar system later this year.Expanding Strategic Collaboration:- Arbe launched a collaboration with NVIDIA to enhance radar-based free space mapping and AI-driven capabilities. Arbe's high-resolution radar integration with the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX in-vehicle computing platform was showcased at CES 2025.Capital Raise:- In January 2025, Arbe successfully raised $33 million through an underwritten registered direct offering, which included the exercise of a $4 million over-allotment option by the underwriters, led by Canaccord Genuity. In addition, in January 2025, $21.5 million was released to the company from the escrow account, following the conversion of convertible bonds issued on the TASE in 2024.Management Comments""We're excited by the progress we've made this quarter as we scale toward high-volume production,"" said Kobi Marenko, Chief Executive Officer. ""We secured radar systems orders for data collection from leading European OEMs, marking a key step toward a design win and reinforcing our position on the path to OEM selection. In parallel, the launch of HiRain's LRR615 system, successfully industrialized using our chipset, demonstrates our Tier 1s' ability to bring Arbe-powered products to market. Sensrad's growing demand across non-automotive applications, evidenced by chipset orders, further expands our market reach and signals their readiness for mass production.""These milestones highlight the depth of our technology, the strength of our partnerships, and the maturity of our execution. Backed by a solid balance sheet, we are well-positioned to lead the transition to ultra-high-resolution radar across both automotive and non-automotive markets.""First Quarter 2025 Financial Results HighlightsRevenues for Q1 2025 were $0.04 million, compared to $0.1 million in Q1 2024. Backlog as of March 31, 2025 amounted to $0.25 million.Gross profit for Q1 2025 was negative ($0.3) million, consistent with the negative gross profit of ($0.3) million in Q1 2024.Operating expenses in Q1 2025 were $13.1 million, compared to $12.5 million in Q1 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a one-time expense related to our continued efforts to finalize chip design toward production, most notably tape-outs. A decrease in non-cash share-based compensation expenses, related to vesting period finalization was offset by year over year provision adjustments.As a result, our operating loss in Q1 2025 was $13.4 million, compared to a $12.8 million loss in Q1 2024.Net loss in Q1 2025 was $13.8 million, compared to a net loss of $12.8 million in Q1 2024. Net loss in Q1 2025 included $0.5 million in financial expenses, compared to $0.05 million in Q1 2024. Financial expenses in Q1 2025 included expenses related to bond conversion and derivative liabilities partially offset by interest from deposits and warrants revaluations. Financial expenses in Q1 2024 included exchange rate revaluation expenses offset by interest from deposits and warrants revaluations.Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation and for non-recurring items, for Q1 2025, yielded a loss of $9.7 million, compared with a loss of $8.5 million in Q1 2024. We believe that this non-GAAP measurement is important in management's evaluation of our use of cash and in planning and evaluating our cash requirements for the coming period.Balance Sheet and Liquidity HighlightsAs of March 31, 2025, Arbe had $36.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short- term bank deposits, and $35.2 million in long-term bank deposits.OutlookArbe's leading radar technology remains a top priority for key decision-makers in the automotive industry. Recent cash infusions totaling nearly $70 million further underscore investor confidence in Arbe's market potential and growth trajectory.- While broader economic shifts have led to short-term delays in automakers' roll-out of advanced driver assistance systems, decision timelines have been extended. As a result, Arbe continues to engage closely with industry leaders, advancing through RFQ stages and reinforced its position for adoption. We continue with our goal to pursue four design-ins with automakers in 2025.- 2025 Annual revenues are expected to be in the range of $2 to $5 million and will be weighted towards the end of the year.- We significantly strengthened our balance sheet, and our adjusted EBITDA for 2025 is projected to be in the range of ($29 million) and ($35 million).Conference Call & Webcast DetailsArbe will host a conference call and webcast today, May 20, 2025, at 8:30 am ET.

Platinum Gets a Glimmer of Hope. But Gold Still Rules. — Barrons.com,1748041860000,"By Andrew BaryPlatinum prices are starting to rise, and the rally could have legs. It has been a while since it was a precious-metal king. In May 2014, platinum traded for $1,500 an ounce, $200 more than gold. But since then, it has trailed gold. On Thursday, gold was at $3,323 an ounce, and platinum, $1,017.Platinum supply runs about seven million ounces annually from mining and recycling, compared with more than 100 million ounces of gold. Platinum has been in deficit for the past two years, meaning that demand has exceeded supply and the market has been drawing down aboveground stocks. The World Platinum Investment Council estimates that the deficit will continue in 2025.One reason: More than half of mined platinum comes from South Africa, where mines are often old, deep, and expensive to operate. The WPIC sees mined supply falling 6% this year to 5.4 million ounces. Unlike gold, platinum lacks central bank demand. Some 40% of demand comes from car catalytic converters, threatened by electric vehicles, which lack converters. But EV sales have stalled, and popular hybrids use converters.Meanwhile, Chinese buyers priced out of gold are turning to platinum. The largest platinum exchange-traded fund, Abrdn Physical Platinum Shares, hit a 52-week high this past week and is up 18% in 2025. As Aberdeen's director of ETF investment strategy, Bob Minter, says, ""For platinum investors, the long wait may be over.""Write to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsOn Monday, markets digested Moody's U.S. debt downgrade and the passage through a House committee of Republicans' tax and budget bill.

Nvidia Selects Navitas Semiconductor to Work on Next-Generation 800V HVDC Architecture,1747861260000,"By Connor HartNvidia will collaborate with Navitas Semiconductor on its next-generation 800V HVDC architecture.Terms of the collaboration, which sent Navitas's stock soaring in after-hours trading, weren't disclosed.Shares of Navitas surged 150%, to $4.81, after the closing bell. Through the regular session's close, shares of Navitas have lost about half their value in the past year.The architecture will support systems that power Nvidia's GPUs, aiming to establish efficient and scalable power for next-generation artificial-intelligence workloads, Navitas said Wednesday.The new device will additionally aim to improve reliability and reduce infrastructure complexity by directly converting grid power to 800V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers and industrial-grade rectifiers. The company said this conversion will eliminate several steps from the current process.As a result, Nvidia's 800V HVDC architecture is expected to improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% and lower cooling costs, according to Navitas.""With our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA's 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU,"" Navitas Chief Executive Gene Sheridan said.Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521010476:0-nvidia-selects-navitas-semiconductor-to-work-on-next-generation-800v-hvdc-architecture/
Nvidia Stock Slips. What's Weighing on the Chip Maker's Shares. — Barrons.com,1747738380000,"By George Glover and Adam ClarkNvidia stock was edging lower early Tuesday as investors weighed up a number of developments that could impact the chip maker's bottom line.Shares slid 0.3% to $135.22 in premarket trading. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 were down 0.3%.There's been a flurry of news about Nvidia, the world's second-largest company by total market capitalization, this week.CEO Jensen Huang said Monday that the chip maker would be opening its artificial-intelligence server platform to rival chip makers, which could offer a new source of revenue.""By making its proprietary interconnect technology available to a much larger set of architectures and use-cases, Nvidia is likely cementing itself further inside of AI racks, even as we see a shift toward multivendor sourcing and greater variation in how these AI racks are built,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Neji in a research note.Neji has an Outperform rating on Nvidia stock with no price target.However, while Nvidia is expanding its market in one area, its sales to China are being restricted.Huang said that the U.S. government's move to limit sales of the company's H20 chip to Chinese customers would hit revenue by $15 billion, in an interview with tech newsletter Stratechery. That's a bigger loss than the $10 billion which had been estimated by analysts at Jefferies.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

Jamie Dimon's Tariffs Warning Should Have Rocked Markets. Why He's Being Ignored. — Barrons.com,1747738080000,"Not much seems to be making a dent in the current market optimism. The latest warnings from JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon on geopolitical risks and tariffs have become par for the course.While he hasn't quite achieved the stature of legendary investor Warren Buffett, as the head of America's biggest bank people usually sit up and listen when Dimon makes predictions.To be sure, he's not always right. He foresaw an economic collapse when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates after the Covid-19 pandemic, and he has been saying for years that the collapse of Bitcoin is imminent.His comments on Monday weren't nearly as controversial. He said stocks could sell off, credit could become scarcer, geopolitical risks are high, the tariff rates that President Donald Trump has imposed are ""extreme,"" and there's a bigger chance of stagflation — the combination of weak growth and quickly rising prices — than people are counting on at the minute.That's sensible enough. But after months of peaks and troughs from tariff news, investors are basking in the relative calm. Stocks were even able to shrug off Moody's downgrade of U.S. government bonds to finish in the black yesterday.Also Dimon isn't worried about JPMorgan. The company stuck to its guidance at its investor day Monday and sees strong growth ahead, in spite of the risks that Dimon himself flagged.There will come a time when the warnings may need to be taken more seriously. Stagflation is miserable and tough to overcome — though if Home Depot's results on Tuesday are anything to go by, things aren't bad yet. The home improvement chain maintained guidance for the year even as it missed expectations for the quarter. Earnings from Target and TJX later in the week will add to the picture.Stagflation is also a tricky situation for the Fed. As interest-rate setters pointed out Monday, it creates a dilemma that could force the central bank to choose — at least in the short term — between the two mandates of keeping inflation low and maximizing employment.One thing Dimon shares with Buffett is that he's going to step down in the not-too-distant future. Investors may not have their sage advice much longer, even if they choose to ignore it now.- Brian Swint***Fed Officials Say Downgrade Complicates Inflation OutlookMoody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating could have implications for prices that Federal Reserve policymakers will need to monitor, according to Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Concern about the U.S.'s financial strength could result in investors demanding higher yields to hold Treasury debt.- Moody's expects the federal deficit to reach nearly 9% of gross domestic product this year, from 6.4% in 2024. The downgrade raises questions about long-term U.S. spending and debt. That makes anything financed by the public and private sectors more expensive, said RSM US chief economist Joe Brusuelas. - The 10-year Treasury note yield is near 4.5%, about where it was a year ago. But if yields were to rise materially again, it could influence the Fed's thinking on interest rates. Bostic, who currently isn't a Fed voting member, told CNBC he is leaning toward one rate cut in 2025. - Based on April inflation data, the average effective tariff rate is now 16%, up from 3% in February, according to Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows expectations for two quarter-point cuts this fall, down from the three cuts expected earlier this year. - Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson and Bostic spoke Monday of continuing uncertainty facing the U.S. economy. It is too early to tell how tariffs and other White House policies, as well as the administration's proposed tax changes, will affect the Fed's dual mandate, Bostic noted. What's Next: The Fed next meets June 17-18 and is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for a fourth straight meeting. Policymakers will also update their economic projections, offering fresh guidance on the likely path of inflation, employment, and interest rates.- Nicole Goodkind***Nvidia's CEO Says Ban of Its Chips to China Costs $15 BillionNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has put a number on the revenue impact of the U.S. government's latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion. He called the ban deeply painful, and said the restrictions are shortsighted and ultimately will only help China.- Last month, the Trump administration effectively banned sending Nvidia's H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter. - Critics have said offering Nvidia's AI chips to China -- even one or two generations old -- can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees, making his comments in an interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson. - The restrictions open the market in China for increased usage of Huawei's AI chips, Huang said in the interview. If more companies use Huawei's chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia's current CUDA software advantage could erode. - His comments coincide with Nvidia's announcement at a trade show in Taiwan that it is taking a significant step toward opening its platform and allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chips for use on equipment in Nvidia server racks. What's Next: The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's system when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology. For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its own server platform.- Tae Kim***At JPMorgan, CEO Dimon's Successor Still a MysteryJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon will mark 20 years in that job next year, and it's still not clear when he will step down from the helm except for his hints at Monday's investor meeting that ""nothing's changed"" from last year and ""it's up to the board."" Dimon turns 70 next year.- Wall Street has been awaiting clarity on his successor since he said last year it wouldn't take another five years. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's consumer banking head, is seen as the top contender. She appeared at investor day and said they had anticipated an economic soft landing ""until recently."" - Dimon's views are closely followed on Wall Street, where he serves as an elder statesman. He cautioned current geopolitical risk is ""very, very high,"" adding that the Trump administration's reduced tariff rates were still ""pretty extreme."" In his view, the chance of stagflation is ""a little bit higher"" than others think. - JPMorgan reaffirmed its full-year net interest income forecast of about $94.5 billion. Management said the company is well positioned to take advantage of a possibly improved regulatory environment and can navigate the current uncertainty that has weighed on the economy. - CFO Jeremy Barnum called JPMorgan one of the early movers in artificial intelligence, originally using it to prevent fraud, and now eyeing other uses for it, such as customer service functions. ""We can't afford to fall behind,"" he said. What's Next: Dimon also reiterated his still-lukewarm feelings about crypto. While he'd be open to JPMorgan offering Bitcoin to clients who want to buy it, he doesn't want the bank to custody it, and personally prefers to keep his distance.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Janet H. Cho***Regeneron Wants This DNA Testing Firm. The Question Is Why?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals entered into a head-scratching $256 million deal for most of the bankrupt consumer genetic-testing business known as 23andMe. What Regeneron seems to be aiming at is using 23andMe's data for drug development. That's what 23andMe planned to do itself as it went public in 2021.- 23andMe became famous for the home DNA tests consumers used to trace their ancestry. Regeneron plans to keep selling DNA tests to consumers. It's also buying the 23andMe ""Biobank,"" a database of genetic information from millions of customers who agreed to allow their genetic data to be used for research. - Once valued at more than $5 billion, 23andMe's business struggled. In bankruptcy filings this year, 23andMe said genetic-testing revenue and demand had declined, while competition had increased. After its bankruptcy in March, consumers raced to have their genetic information deleted from its database and genetic samples destroyed. - Regeneron's drug Eylea for wet age-related macular degeneration faces stiff competition, particularly from a new Amgen drug called Pavblu. Sales of a new dose of Eylea are lagging expectations, and analysts are watching as Regeneron defines its next chapter as Eylea and Dupixent near patent expiration. - The company's chief scientific officer, George Yancopoulos, said the 23andMe deal can help build upon its mission to help those interested in learning about their own DNA and how to improve their personal health, ""while furthering Regeneron's efforts to use large-scale genetics research to improve the way society treats and prevents illness overall."" What's Next: The bankruptcy court on June 17 is scheduled to review and potentially approve the transaction. Regeneron has assured 23andMe customers that it would comply with its consumer-privacy policies and protect its data with high standards for data privacy, security, and ethical oversight.- Josh Nathan-Kazis and Janet H. Cho*** UnitedHealth Insiders Buy Stock After SlumpThe raft of bad news weighing on UnitedHealth Group stock appeared to be a buying opportunity for a bunch of its directors. Five company insiders, including new CEO Stephen Hemsley, have bought stock, showing the embattled health insurer's execs are willing to ""put their money where their mouth is,"" according to one analyst.- Hemsley purchased about $25 million of UnitedHealth stock on Friday -- 86,700 shares at an average price of $288.57 -- according to a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday. CFO John Rex and three directors also bought shares. - UnitedHealth stock rose 8% Monday, beating every other stock in both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's still down 37% in 2025, making it the Dow's worst performer for the year. - UnitedHealth shares fell sharply last week after the company surprised Wall Street by pulling financial guidance for 2025 and bringing Hemsley back to the CEO role to replace Andrew Witty, who stepped down for ""personal reasons."" Hemsley had been CEO from 2006 to 2017. - Shares were also pressured by a report from The Wall Street Journal saying that the Justice Department is investigating the company for possible criminal Medicare fraud. UnitedHealth said in a statement that it hadn't been notified by the Justice Department of the criminal investigation and that it stands ""by the integrity of [its] Medicare Advantage program."" What's Next: The insider buys could be good news for the beaten-down stock, per Zacks Investment Research strategist Andrew Rocco. ""Heavy insider buying in a short period is one of the best 'tells' savvy investors can observe for a prospective stock. Last week, UNH insiders put their money where their mouth is,"" he said.- Andrew Bary***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert SteinerThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

NVIDIA Selects Navitas to Collaborate on Next Generation 800 V HVDC Architecture,1747858661000,"TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Navitas Semiconductor NASDAQ:NVTS , the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast™ gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC™ silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support ‘Kyber’ rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast™ and GeneSiC™ power technologies.NVIDIA’s next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity.Today’s existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency.Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia’s approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability.        Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand.The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra.Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. The high-power GaNSafe™ power ICs integrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world’s safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCC pin.Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V.Enabled by 20 years of SiC innovation leadership, GeneSiC proprietary ‘trench-assisted planar’ technology provides world-leading performance over temperature, delivering high-speed, cool-running operation for high-power, high-reliability applications. G3F SiC MOSFETs deliver high-efficiency with high-speed performance, enabling up to 25°C lower case temperature, and up to 3x longer life than SiC products from other vendors.Offering the industry’s broadest voltage range – stretching from 650 V to ultra-high voltages of 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV, the SiC technology has been implemented in multiple projects for MW energy storage and grid-tied inverters with the Department of Energy (DoE).In August 2023, Navitas introduced a high-speed, high-efficiency  3.2 kW CRPS, achieving a 40% smaller size  than best-in-class, legacy silicon solutions for power-hungry AI and Edge computing. This was followed by the  world’s highest power density 4.5 kW  CRPS, achieving a ground-breaking 137 W/in3, and an efficiency of over 97%. In November 2024, Navitas released the  world’s first 8.5 kW  AI data center power supply, powered by GaN and SiC that could meet 98% efficiency, complying with the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Rack v3 (ORv3) specifications. Additionally, Navitas created  IntelliWeave, an innovative patented new digital control  technique, that when combined with high-power GaNSafe and Gen 3-Fast SiC MOSFETs, enables PFC peak efficiencies to 99.3% and reduces power losses by 30% compared to existing solutions. Alongside the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, the latest release of their 12 kW PSU was presented at the Navitas ‘ AI Tech Night’ on 21st May.“We are proud to be selected by NVIDIA to collaborate on their 800 HVDC architecture initiative. Our latest innovations in high-power GaN and SiC technologies have seen world firsts and have created new inflections into markets such as AI datacenters and electric vehicles ”, said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. “With our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU. We appreciate that NVIDIA recognizes our technology and commitment to driving the next generation of data center power delivery.”NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC architecture will improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% (due to fewer PSU failures), and lower cooling costs by directly connecting HVDC to the IT and compute racks.To read NVIDIA’s technical blog, please click here .

Nvidia lost half its market share in China: find out how,1747857481000,"Nvidia Corp NASDAQ:NVDA is in focus on Wednesday after Jensen Huang, its chief executive, said the AI darling has lost nearly half of its market share in China due to the Trump administration’s new export controls.In a press conference at Computex, he went on to call those restrictions a “failure”, adding they’re not hurting China as much as they’re hurting the US businesses.Huang’s remarks arrive shortly after US President Donald Trump secured a sizable multi-year AI infrastructure deal for Nvidia during his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Following the tariffs-related crash, Nvidia stock is now up some 45% versus its year-to-date low.US export controls may be helping ChinaAccording to Jensen Huang, recently tightened restrictions on the export of sophisticated chips have slashed Nvidia’s market share in China from a whopping 95% to just 50% within weeks.Additionally, the federal controls are doing more harm to American businesses, also because they have motivated the world’s second-largest economy to accelerate plans of making its own chips, he added.This could prove a threat to the US dominance in artificial intelligence since Huang has already confirmed that Beijing is “right behind” Washington in AI, and now that it’s motivated to design its own chips, it could gain further ground on that front in no time.Note that Nvidia shares are still down some 10% versus their year-to-date high.Huawei could gain share if Nvidia is restricted from selling to ChinaStacy Rasgon, a senior Bernstein analyst, also agrees that making it harder for Nvidia to play in China, the Trump administration is practically giving away the region’s AI market to Huawei.Huawei’s capabilities in artificial intelligence are not lost on Jensen Huang either.“They’re incredible in computing and network technology, all essential capabilities to advance AI. They have made enormous progress in the last several years,” he acknowledged in a recent statement.Investors should note that there have already been reports of Huawei working on its advanced chip that could go neck-and-neck with the US chipmakers, including NVDA, in the coming years.Is Nvidia stock worth buying ahead of Q1 earnings release?Huang’s remarks arrive a week before Nvidia is scheduled to report its earnings for fiscal Q1.Consensus is for the artificial intelligence company to earn 82 cents a share in its current quarter, well above the 58 cents per share it earned in the same quarter last year.Ahead of the chipmaker’s release, the AI stock is worth owning, argued a Loop Capital analyst, Ananda Baruah, in his research note on Wednesday.Baruah maintained his “buy” rating on NVDA shares this morning.He’s convinced the stock could hit $175 over the next 12 months.

Taiwan president pledges peace with China but says island must strengthen defences,1747708607000,"Taiwan wants peace and dialogue with China but the government must continue to strengthen the island's defences, President Lai Ching-te said on Tuesday as he completed one year in office.China calls Lai a ""separatist"" and has rebuffed his multiple offers for talks. Lai rejects China's sovereignty claims over the democratic and separately governed island, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future.The government has warned that Beijing could mark the anniversary with military drills but speaking to reporters at the presidential office in central Taipei, Lai offered a message of peace. ""I, too, am committed to peace. Because peace is priceless and war has no winners. But when it comes to seeking peace, we cannot have dreams nor illusions,"" he said.Taiwan will continue to strengthen its defences as preparing for war is the best way to avoid it, Lai added.""I also reiterate here - Taiwan is happy to have exchanges and cooperation with China as long as there is reciprocal dignity. Using exchanges to replace hemming in, dialogue to replace confrontation.""China's Taiwan Affairs Office on Tuesday called Lai's speech a ""two-faced tactic"" that's a ""waste of effort and doomed to fail.""""No matter what the leaders of the Taiwan region say or how they say it, it cannot change the fact that Taiwan is a part of China ... nor can it stop the inevitable trend of national reunification,"" the office's spokesperson Chen Binhua said in a statement.China's defence ministry last week said Lai was a ""Taiwan Strait crisis maker"" who had increased antagonism and confrontation and undermined peace and stability.Lai also faces a challenge from possible U.S. tariffs, currently on pause, and said talks with Washington were continuing ""smoothly"".The government also plans to establish a sovereign wealth fund to boost the tech-focused economy, he added.""The government will set up a sovereign fund to create a national investment platform, making full use of Taiwan's industrial strengths, led by the government, in collaboration with the strengths of private enterprises,"" Lai said, without giving details.After finishing his media event, Lai attended the opening ceremony for the ongoing Computex trade show, where Taiwan-born Jensen Huang, the CEO of AI darling Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , is the star attraction. Lai visited the booths of Nvidia suppliers and partners, including Foxconn TWSE:2317 and Mediatek TWSE:2454 , chatting with senior executives there. Last month, China held war games code-named ""Strait Thunder-2025A"" around Taiwan, the ""A"" at its end suggesting there could be more to come.China called its May 2024 drills just after Lai took office ""Joint Sword-2024A"", and in October of that year staged ""Joint Sword-2024B"".In a daily report detailing Chinese military activities, Taiwan's defence ministry said in the past 24 hours it had detected six Chinese planes and 11 vessels near the island.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RS027:0-taiwan-president-pledges-peace-with-china-but-says-island-must-strengthen-defences/"

At Computex 2025, the chipmaker launched NVLink Fusion, a new effort to let outside CPUs and ASICs work with its GPUspart of a broader bid to remain indispensable in AI infrastructure, even when competitors build the rest.NVLink used to be Nvidia-only. Not anymore. Fusion cracks open the ecosystem, making room for third-party processors to plug into Nvidia's platform. Early partners include MediaTek, Marvell Technology (MRVL, Financials), Synopsys (SNPS, Financials), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS, Financials), and Alchip. Customers like Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials) now have more room to mix and match.That flexibility matters. Nvidia already dominates general-purpose AI chips, but rivals like Amazon and Google are pouring money into custom silicon. Analysts say Fusion helps Nvidia stay in the roomeven if it doesn't own all the furniture.There's a tradeoff. Fusion could reduce demand for Nvidia's own CPUs, but makes its GPUs harder to replace in hybrid systems.Broadcom (AVGO, Financials), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials), and Intel (INTC, Financials) are not part of this first wave.Nvidia also introduced DGX Cloud Lepton, a kind of GPU marketplace to help AI developers find cloud horsepower.

Cathie Wood Calls Healthcare the Most Overlooked AI Winner,1747692516000,"While everyone's busy chasing the next Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Cathie Wood is leaning into a very different corner of the AI story: healthcare.In a set of recent Bloomberg interviews, the Ark Invest founder said something most investors aren't ready to hear that the biggest gains from artificial intelligence may not come from the companies building the tech, but from the ones quietly using it to rewrite the rules of science.She's talking about drug discovery. Instead of spending years testing combinations in the lab, researchers are now training algorithms to predict what works and they're getting results in weeks. Costs are falling. Timelines are shrinking. And according to Wood, the market hasn't priced in just how big that shift is going to be.It's flying under the radar, according to her.And it's not just AI that's making her bullish. Wood believes the U.S. is entering a more innovation-friendly stretch something she didn't feel under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who she says nearly pushed the crypto industry out of the country. That tide is turning, she says, with digital assets regaining traction and the tech ecosystem breathing a bit easier.Add in the latest round of tariff negotiations which Wood frames as a tax cut in disguise and you've got the makings of a policy backdrop that could supercharge overlooked sectors.This is classic Ark playbook: Go where the long-term story is strong, even if the headlines haven't caught up. In the past, that meant Tesla. Then bitcoin. Now, it might just be AI-fueled healthcare.If Wood's right, the next wave of big winners won't be making chips.

Nvidia CEO Explodes Over U.S. Chip Ban--Says It Helped China Win the AI Race,1747848539000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA CEO Jensen Huang just called out Washington's chip crackdownsaying it might've done the opposite of what it intended. Speaking at Computex in Taipei, Huang said U.S. export controls didn't stall China's AI pushthey accelerated it. Four years ago, we had 95% of the market in China. Now we're down to 50%, he said. The other half? Homegrown competitors, supercharged by local funding and urgency. Huang pointed to Huawei and other Chinese players who are now aggressively building alternatives. They will use the second-best. Local companies are very determined, he added.It gets worse.

If finalized, that shift could open the door for U.S. companies to expand AI exportsjust not to nations viewed as adversarial.Meanwhile, Beijing isn't standing still.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The company is benefiting from an expanding portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business, strong balance sheet and impressive free cash flow. Broadcom has outperformed its closest semiconductor peers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Marvell Technology MRVL, shares of which have returned 35.6%, 32.6% and 21%, respectively, over the same time frame.AVGO Stock’s PerformanceBroadcom’s strategy of updating its portfolio on a frequent basis has been a key catalyst. The company is expanding its portfolio with the launch of its third-generation 200G per lane (200G/lane) Co-Packaged Optics product line. In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C) This follows March showcase of 200G/lane DSP and SerDes, 400G optics, and PCIe Gen6 over optics products at the 2025 Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC). Strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

"Citadel CEO Ken Griffin Offloads NVIDIA, Bets $326 Million on AMD",1747684189000,"May 19 - Citadel founder Ken Griffin trimmed his Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA stake by half in the first quarter while sharply boosting his position in Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD , according to a filing with the SEC.Griffin said AI tools have improved productivity but may not revolutionize core trading strategies, suggesting he sees limited near-term impact on Citadel's performance.Nvidia, long the leader in AI chips with roughly an 80 percent market share, still reported a 78 percent jump in fiscal Q4 data-center revenue to $35.6 billion. Yet Griffin sold 1.55 million shares, reducing his exposure by about 50 percent.By contrast, he acquired 2.79 million AMD shares, worth roughly $326 million, raising that position more than threefold. AMD's first-quarter revenue of $7.44 billion and 57 percent year-over-year data-center growth appear to have swayed the hedge fund titan.Market observers note growing deployment challenges for Nvidia systems, cooling, configuration and supply-chain complexities, which could benefit AMD's simpler solutions. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri remains optimistic on AMD's AI roadmap, citing rising traction with U.S. cloud providers.Griffin's moves underline a cautious view on AI investing: seeking growth in chipmakers that blend performance gains with manageable deployment demands.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:b975c714b094b:0-citadel-ceo-ken-griffin-offloads-nvidia-bets-326-million-on-amd/

"Nvidia CEO Backs President Trump on AI, Blasts Biden's Chip Crackdown",1747842787000,"May 21 - Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Jensen Huang said the U.S. restrictions on exporting AI chips to China have backfired, costing American firms billions in potential sales.Huang said the 2023 ""AI Diffusion"" rule, introduced by the Biden administration, was built on fundamentally flawed assumptions. The policy, which banned exports of high-end chips to China, was aimed at curbing China's AI development but instead boosted Chinese suppliers like Huawei Technologies, he said.Since the rule came into effect, Nvidia's share of the Chinese AI chip market has dropped to about 50% from 95%, Huang noted. He warned that China's domestic AI industry is expanding rapidly, and added, They would love for us never to go back.Nvidia faces an estimated $15 billion revenue impact from restrictions affecting its H20 chips, on top of a $5.5 billion charge reported in April, Huang said. The company is now developing a modified Blackwell chip with slower memory to meet compliance standards.Huang also backed Donald Trump's stance on AI trade policy, saying the former president's plans to roll back the restrictions are a more practical approach.Nvidia shares were down about 1% in early Wednesday trading.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:9cb953187094b:0-nvidia-ceo-backs-president-trump-on-ai-blasts-biden-s-chip-crackdown/
Nvidia CEO Says 'Deeply Painful' China H20 Ban Will Cut Sales by $15 Billion — Barrons.com,1747680300000,"Tae KimNvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government's latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia's H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.""This additional ban on Nvidia's H20 is deeply painful,"" Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. ""We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably — what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes"" for the U.S.Critics have said offering Nvidia's artificial-intelligence chips to China — even one or two generations old — can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei's AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei's chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia's current CUDA software advantage could erode.""Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,"" Huang said. ""If we don't compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we're not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they're not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.""The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia's products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"NVIDIA ""AI Factories"" -- More Than Clever Marketing?",1747676040000,"NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his ""AI Factory"" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about ""AI Factories"" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: ""massively parallel architectures.""I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled ""Get Your MPA in Deep Learning."" Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or ""in parallel,"" without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year ""We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more.""The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night...""AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”""They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, ""tokens"" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet.""NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he’s not talking about Bitcoin.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:9b9d51aa7094b:0-nvidia-ai-factories-more-than-clever-marketing/

"Nvidia Growth To Continue, But Chip Restriction Needs Consideration — Market Talk",1747675500000,"Nvidia should see its trend of strong revenue growth continue, but consensus estimates may not fully account for the recent H20 export restriction, Raymond James' Srini Pajjuri and Grant Li say in a research note. The analysts expect revenue growth between $4 billion and $5 billion during the past six quarters to continue on strong ramps for its Blackwell chip, but they note that the restrictions on the H20 chips present a roughly $4 billion headwind, leaving them to expect limited sequential growth in 2Q. ""That said, we fully expect management to sound bullish on 2H given the strong hyperscale capex trends and recent AI diffusion rule changes,"" say the analysts. Nvidia is scheduled to report 1QFY26 results on May 28. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250519007080:0/
D-Wave Stock Surges 28%. The Company Made an Advancement in the Quantum Race. — Barrons.com,1747835280000,"By Mackenzie TatananniD-Wave Quantum said Tuesday that its sixth-generation quantum system had become available over the cloud, marking another development in the race to develop commercially viable quantum computers.The Advantage2 system is the successor to D-Wave's Advantage, which was released in September 2020. For now, customers will be able to access Advantage2 through D-Wave's Leap cloud service, though physical machines will be deployed gradually over the next few years.Management cited the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines could effectively handle.Shares soared 28% to $16.90 on Tuesday. The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.Trevor Lanting, the company's chief development officer, told Barron's that D-Wave had focused on building greater connectivity between quantum bits, or the basic units of information in a quantum machine.""This allows us to pose more complex problems and solve them with the technology, whether they're business optimization problems or lattice materials,"" Lanting explained.Other improvements allowing the technology to run more efficiently, such as improved coherence and a higher energy scale, have reduced its appetite for power compared with previous generations, Lanting said.""Fundamentally, this is energy-efficient computing for hard problems,"" Lanting continued. ""I think you're going to see a lot more focus on the energy footprint of computation over the next decade. It's growing and it's growing fast.""While Advantage2 will only be accessible over the cloud for now, D-Wave plans to upgrade on-premises systems in years to come. These include the machine purchased by the Jülich Supercomputing Centre in February and the system currently being installed at Davidson Technologies' headquarters in Alabama.CEO Alan Baratz told Barron's that an upgrade was a ""multi-month exercise.""""We've got to warm up the system, we've got to install the new processor, we've got to cool down the system, we've got to recalibrate the system — and just the calibration process itself could take four to six months, "" Baratz explained.The CEO has been one of the most outspoken advocates of quantum technology, particularly its commercial applications. This has resulted in pushback from critics including the authors of a short report in April who alleged that the company oversold itself and made false claims about the performance of its systems. (Baratz told Barron's that the allegations were ""ridiculous"" and the report itself was ""full of misinformation."")The report came at a time when shares had already been beaten down substantially. D-Wave and peers began sliding at the end of March following Nvidia's annual developer conference, where timelines for wide-scale deployment of the technology failed to materialize.Investor frustration culminated in a selloff that caused some quantum stocks to see double-digit declines, D-Wave among them. The stock closed down 18% on Nvidia's inaugural ""Quantum Day.""That wasn't the only thing weighing on shares. Ahead of the event, D-Wave claimed it had demonstrated ""quantum supremacy"" after one of its systems completed a materials simulation task in 20 minutes that would've taken one of the world's most powerful supercomputers nearly 1 million years.Shares climbed on the heels of the announcement, but as scrutiny mounted those gains slipped away. The stock's most recent ascent came on the heels of D-Wave's first-quarter financial results, which included record revenue and a narrower quarterly loss.The caveat about quantum pure-plays is that they are not yet profitable. This has been a pervasive issue for the industry, with stocks trading largely on headlines and sentiment.While D-Wave didn't turn a profit in its latest quarter, revenue increased 509% from a year earlier. Bookings, a metric representing customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future, decreased 64% to $1.6 million.Baratz had an explanation. ""We're in the early stages of commercializing quantum, so as we're getting started, bookings are going to be more lumpy as opposed to smoothly increasing,"" the CEO said.The metric can be parsed into three types of deals: professional services, quantum-as-a-service, and system sales. System sales carry a hefty price tag, to the tune of $20 to $40 million apiece, and have a longer lead time as a result.The cost barrier is one reason why it's difficult to determine a timeline for wide-scale deployment. Another is the sensitive nature of quantum computers themselves. As the basic units of information in a system are subatomic particles like photons or electrons, this makes them particularly sensitive to environmental interference, which can cause the machines to bungle calculations.Until these more pervasive issues are resolved, it is unclear when quantum computing will catch on. However, the technology has the potential to dramatically transform the field of drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and the financial sector.D-Wave, for one, is already at work on its next generation of quantum processors, with a focus on increasing qubit count to create more powerful multi-chip solutions.'We're able to do calculations beyond the reach of possibility for classical systems,"" Lanting told Barron's. ""There is a gap and that gap will continue to open up very rapidly. That's the promise of quantum computing.""Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"HPE Stock Is Rising Again. Expect More Gains, Analyst Says. — Barrons.com",1747835160000,"Mackenzie TatananniShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise have slumped this year due to disappointing financial results and broader market weakness. However, analysts believe the stock could see explosive gains, with their most optimistic case forecasting 72% upside to the current price.Evercore ISI analysts upgraded shares of the server and cloud-software company to Outperform from In Line, and lifted the price target to $22 from $17, citing a ""fairly attractive"" risk-reward balance, ""specially for investors that have some duration.""Shares climbed 3.4% to $18.05, on pace for their highest close since March 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.The Evercore upgrade had much to do with it. In the Tuesday note, analysts presented a handful scenarios showing how the stock price could rise as high as $31 or sink as low as $15.Investors are waiting for the Justice Department to approve HPE's merger with Juniper Networks after moving to block it earlier this year. (Evercore expects ""some concessions from HPE"" to push the deal through.)In this upside scenario, the analysts expect HPE to deliver ""double-digit [earnings per share] growth"" through the first year following the merger, with operational issues also being resolved. In their view, earnings growth could lift the stock to around $24.If the Juniper deal doesn't pan out, the analysts believe this could drive the stock price even higher. Out of options, HPE might be forced to employ ""aggressive cost reduction and optimization efforts"" to improve operating margins across both its Hybrid Cloud and Intelligence Edge segments.""This would effectively provide an 'alternative' path to an activist asking for an excessive/levered buyback,"" the analysts wrote. Like the first argument, they believe earnings growth could push HPE shares to $26 to $31.The firm's least-favorable scenario calls for ""business as usual,"" with the deal not closing, and HPE ""maintaining the status quo."" That would keep the stock range-bound, between $15 and $16, the Evercore team said.Another news item may have contributed to the stock's ascent on Tuesday. The Evercore upgrade came after HP announced it had fine-tuned its HPE Private Cloud AI, which it co-developed with Nvidia, ""to further aid AI developers.""HPE stock ended Monday's session down 1.6%. The year-to-date loss stood at 16%, tamped down by a mix of macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointing financial results.The stock cratered in March after HPE posted a mixed first-quarter print, including guidance that undershot expectations.

Hims & Hers Health and AST SpaceMobile have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1748004600000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Tutor Perini Corp. TPC as the Bull of the Day and YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Tutor Perini Corp. just beat and raised 2025 earnings guidance as its construction backlog hit a record high. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) expects earnings in 2026 and 2027 to more than double 2025 earnings.Tutor Perini is a civil, building and specialty construction company offering general contracting and design-build services to private customers and public agencies worldwide. It has expertise on large, complex projects.Tutor Perini often self-performs multiple project components including earthwork, excavation, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditions as well as fire protection.It's a small cap company with a market cap of $1.88 billion.Big Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini reported its first quarter 2025 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 783%. It reported earnings of $0.53 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.06.It was the company's second best first quarter EPS ever.Tutor Perini has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters.Revenue was up 19% to $1.25 billion from $1.05 billion in the year ago period. Growth was solid across all three segments but was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects. These projects have significant scope of work remaining.During the first quarter, the company voluntarily repaid the remaining $121.9 million outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, which contributed to a 24% reduction in the company's total debt as compared to the total debt at the end of 2024.Tutor Perini expects solid operating cash flow for the rest of 2025.Tutor Perini has a Record BacklogThe business keeps rolling in. In the first quarter, Tutor Perini booked another $2 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, bringing the company's new backlog to a record of $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2025.That is up 94% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2024.Included in those new awards and contracts was the $1.18 billion Manhattan Tunnel project in New York; a $100 million electrical project in Texas; $241 million in additional funding for the Apra Harbor Waterfront Repairs project in Guam; and $111 million of additional funding for certain healthcare facility projects in California.Additionally, the backlog is expected to remain robust as it has already won more than $500 million in new awards in the second quarter of 2025.But it is not resting on these laurels. Other big projects are available. In the Civil segment, Tutor Perini recently bid the multi-billion-dollar Midtown Bus Terminal Replacement project in New York and was awaiting contractor selection by the owner.Tutor Perini Expects No Impact from the TariffsMany investors are worried about the impact of the 2025 tariffs. As of May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini did not expect to see any significant impact from the tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding.But they will take that quarter by quarter.Tutor Perini Raised Full Year Earnings GuidanceWith a record backlog and opportunities to add to it further, it's not a surprise that Tutor Perini is bullish about 2025.It raised full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.95 from its prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.90.Tutor Perini is lightly followed on the Street, but one analyst did raise their earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026 after the earnings report.The Zacks Consensus jumped to $1.84 from $1.53 prior to the report. That is earnings growth of 158.8% as the company lost $3.13 last year.2026 is also looking bullish as the company said they expect earnings to more than double that of 2025 in 2026 and 2027.1 estimate was raised for 2026 in the last 30 days as well, pushing up 2026 to $2.87. That is further earnings growth of 56%.Here's what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart.Shares Soar in 2025Tutor Perini is a small cap company. The small caps have struggled in 2025 but not Tutor Perini.Shares soared to new 5-year highs on the earnings beat and guidance raise and are outperforming the Russell 2000 small cap index year-to-date.Yet, the company is still attractively priced. Tutor Perini trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.3.But it has even cheaper value metrics with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.4 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. A P/S ratio under 1.0 and a P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicate value.With a record backlog, Tutor Perini is a small cap stock to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:YETI Holdings, Inc. cut guidance in May 2025 due to the impact of the tariffs. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is now expected to see a double-digit decline in earnings this year.YETI is a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor products worldwide. This includes coolers, drinkware, backpacks and bags.A Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 8, 2025, YETI reported its first quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.04. Earnings were $0.31 compared to the consensus of $0.27.This was the 5th earnings beat in a row.Net sales rose 3% to $351.1 million from $341.4 million a year ago. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 4% to $196.2 million primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.While Wholesale channel sales rose just 1% to $154.9 million, also due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.However, the first quarter seems like a different world as Liberation Day tariffs changed the business in April.YETI's Plan to Mitigate the TariffsYETI already had a plan for supply chain diversification, which is ahead of plan. It is aggressively diversifying its sourcing out of China.It expects, by the end of 2025, to have limited exposure to future goods sourced from China. Less than 5% of its total costs of goods will be related to products from China, for the U.S. market.YETI's ability to generate cash is expected to be intact, even with the disruption from the tariff impacts.YETI Lowers 2025 GuidanceBut while it is mitigating the tariffs, sales and earnings are still expected to be impacted.For 2025, adjusted sales are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, down from its prior projection of 5% to 7%.Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.02, down from the prior projection of $2.90 to $2.95.Not surprisingly, the analysts had to cut their estimates to get in line with the new guidance. 10 estimates were cut in the last 30 days for 2025.The Zacks Consensus fell to $2.04 from $2.88. That's down 25.3% from 2024, when YETI made $2.73.10 estimates were also cut for 2026.You can see the results on the price and consensus chart.Shares Near 1-Year LowsYETI was a pandemic winner as people headed outdoors. But since 2022, it's been tougher.Shares are down double digits over the last year.It's cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value.YETI has a strong balance sheet. It had cash of $259 million as of the end of the first quarter and total debt of $77 million.However, it lowered its 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $100 to $125 million from $200 million due to the impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher tariff cost.Investors interested in YETI might want to wait for more certainty on the tariff fall-out before jumping in.Additional content:3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Scales All-Time HighsThe cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. , PayPal Holdings and NVIDIA Corp. . Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers.Bitcoin's rally followed the U.S. equity market's slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value.Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing.Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market.3 Crypto-Centric Stocks With UpsideVisaVisa Inc. is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Criticizes AI Chip Curbs as Market Share in China Falls,1747834697000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) chief executive Jensen Huang said U.S. export controls on AI chips to China had backfired, cutting the company's market share and accelerating the rise of Chinese chipmakers like Huawei.Revenue figures weren't disclosed, but Huang said Nvidia's share of the AI chip market in China plunged to 50% from nearly 95% since the start of former President Joe Biden's administration. He attributed the decline to U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced chips, which spurred Chinese firms to develop alternatives.Huang said the export curbs energized local players, giving them spirit, energy, and government support to build a self-reliant semiconductor supply chain. Huawei and others have reportedly filled demand gaps left by U.S. companies.The Biden-era restrictions were intended to limit China's access to AI chips over national security concerns. However, Huang said former President Donald Trump's decision last week to roll back parts of the policy reflected a better understanding of global competition. He said the prior approach had the wrong goal.Beijing condemned fresh U.S. guidance discouraging the use of Chinese chips, saying it violated earlier trade understandings and warning of firm steps if U.S. actions harm Chinese interests.- Explore Nvidia's insider activity. - See valuation trends on the Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1c26b4f3e094b:0-nvidia-nvda-ceo-criticizes-ai-chip-curbs-as-market-share-in-china-falls/
Dell unveils new AI servers powered by Nvidia chips to boost enterprise adoption,1747672200000,"Dell Technologies NYSE:DELL on Monday unveiled new servers powered by Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA Blackwell Ultra chips, aiming to capitalize on the booming demand for artificial intelligence systems.The servers, available in both air-cooled and liquid-cooled variations, support up to 192 Nvidia Blackwell Ultra chips but can be customized to include as many as 256 chips.These servers can train AI models up to four times faster than previous models, Dell said.The pricing of these products will be ""competitive,"" Arthur Lewis, President of Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group, told Reuters, adding that ""there's a lot of interest on what's next.""Dell and Super Micro Computer NASDAQ:SMCI have benefited from the growing demand for servers designed to handle the computer-heavy AI tasks, but the high cost of producing the systems and tough competition have pressured their margins. Dell in February forecast a decline in adjusted gross margin rate for fiscal 2026, while Super Micro projected fourth-quarter revenue below estimates earlier this month as tariff-driven economic uncertainty pressures its performance.Dell will focus on increasing sales of networking and storage products to ensure the ""right level of profitability,"" Lewis said.The company's new servers will also support Nvidia's upcoming Vera central processing units, which will succeed the chip designer's Grace server processor.The AI server maker plans to support Nvidia's Vera Rubin chips, set to follow the Blackwell series.Dell also introduced a 'Pro Max Plus' laptop designed for AI development on Monday, featuring a neural processing unit that allows engineers to process large AI models directly on the device without relying on cloud services.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RR0O7:0-dell-unveils-new-ai-servers-powered-by-nvidia-chips-to-boost-enterprise-adoption/"
"Nvidia CEO Backs Trump, Criticizes AI Chip Curbs",1747831857000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang criticized the U.S. government's restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence chips to China, calling the policy a ""failure"" that cost American companies billions in lost revenue.Speaking at the Computex conference in Taipei, Huang said the Biden-era export rules created under the so-called AI Diffusion policy were based on flawed assumptions. The rules, introduced in January, blocked high-end processor sales to China and limited supply to other countries. Huang emphasized that over half of the world's AI researchers are based in China, and the U.S. restrictions forced many to turn to local suppliers like Huawei.President Donald Trump has said he plans to end the policy if re-elected. Huang voiced support for that plan, saying it acknowledges that U.S. firms are not the only providers of advanced chips. Earlier this year, Microsoft raised similar concerns, saying the policy could boost China's AI sector.Nvidia's share of the Chinese AI chip market has dropped from 95% to 50% since President Biden took office. Huang estimated the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion next year, a major opportunity the company risks missing.Earlier this week, Nvidia said the U.S. licensing rule for its H20 GPUs could cost it $15 billion in revenue.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:928c4848f094b:0-nvidia-ceo-backs-trump-criticizes-ai-chip-curbs/

"Nvidia NVLink Fusion Stuns at Computex, BofA Calls It 'Most Impactful Reveal'",1747671012000,"May 19 - Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA grabbed headlines at Computex when it rolled out NVLink Fusion, a move Bank of America NYSE:BAC says is likely the most impactful reveal of the event. NVLink Fusion lets data centers pair Nvidia GPUs with third-party CPUs or custom AI accelerators, broadening the company's reach beyond its own silicon.In a client note, BofA analyst Vivek Arya highlighted that Fusion couples Nvidia's proprietary interconnect fabric and Spectrum switch with modified ASICs from partners such as Marvell, Alchip, Synopsys and Cadence, and could even tie into ARM-based CPUs from Qualcomm or Fujitsu.Beyond Fusion, Nvidia unveiled a wider AI lineup spanning cloud, enterprise, gaming and robotics, which Arya said may help power what he calls the multi-trillion-dollar AI factory market.The firm also confirmed that its rack-scale GB200 NVL 72 Blackwell systems are now in full production, and that the RTX Pro enterprise server is accelerating competition with x86 architectures.Arya maintained his Buy rating and $160 price target, noting that ongoing Middle East sovereign AI deals could yield long-term gains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:55f41ce24094b:0-nvidia-nvlink-fusion-stuns-at-computex-bofa-calls-it-most-impactful-reveal/
Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Nvidia (NVDA) Backs Trump Plan to Reverse AI Chip Curbs,1747830637000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) CEO Jensen Huang said the U.S. export curbs on AI chips to China failed to achieve their goals and instead caused major financial harm to American companies. He endorsed the Trump administration's effort to abandon the tiered restrictions.Nvidia has taken a $5.5 billion charge related to U.S. limits on exports of its H20 chips to China. Huang estimated the restrictions could cost Nvidia up to $15 billion in lost revenue.The company's China market share dropped to 50% from 95% since the Biden administration imposed the AI diffusion rule, which blocked advanced chip exports to China. In response, Chinese firms like Huawei gained traction, and the country boosted its domestic chip infrastructure.Huang said competition in China has become intense and noted that many in the country would prefer Nvidia not return. He projected the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion by 2026, a key opportunity despite geopolitical hurdles.To navigate current limits, Nvidia is working on a modified Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with U.S. rules. Meanwhile, China has demanded that Washington remove discriminatory chip measures, warning of further action if curbs persist.The Trump administration is reportedly considering a new global licensing regime to replace the existing three-tier model, which could give the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.- See insider trades for NVDA. - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:15ffb745a094b:0-nvidia-nvda-backs-trump-plan-to-reverse-ai-chip-curbs/

"Nvidia opens NVLink Fusion ecosystem, expands Taiwan footprint with Foxconn",1747670074000,"Nvidia has unveiled a major expansion to its AI hardware strategy with the launch of NVLink Fusion, a platform that allows third-party processors to work seamlessly alongside Nvidia GPUs. Previously restricted to Nvidia’s own chips, the NVLink interconnect technology will now support central processing units (CPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from external vendors. The move, announced by CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote at Computex 2025 in Taiwan, marks a shift in Nvidia’s approach—one that aims to secure its position at the heart of next-generation AI infrastructure, even in hybrid systems that do not rely exclusively on its components.MediaTek, Qualcomm, and others onboard NVLink FusionThe new NVLink Fusion programme has already secured a number of key partners. Chipmakers including MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence have joined the initiative. The integration enables clients such as Qualcomm Technologies and Fujitsu to connect their own CPUs to Nvidia GPUs in AI data centre environments. By doing so, these companies can benefit from Nvidia’s ecosystem and interconnect bandwidth while maintaining flexibility in hardware design.This development allows clients to build semi-custom AI systems, rather than relying solely on off-the-shelf solutions from Nvidia.Ray Wang, a US-based technology analyst, noted that NVLink Fusion helps Nvidia tap into demand for data centres built on ASICs, traditionally considered alternatives to Nvidia’s general-purpose graphics processors. Wang said the new approach “consolidates Nvidia as the centre of next-generation AI factories”, especially as tech giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft continue developing proprietary AI chips.Nvidia responds to custom chip competitionNvidia currently dominates the GPU market used in general AI training, but it faces increasing competition from hyperscalers investing in custom silicon. The new NVLink Fusion strategy appears to be a direct response, allowing Nvidia to retain a role in AI compute systems that integrate diverse hardware.According to Rolf Bulk, equity analyst at New Street Research, the flexibility offered by NVLink Fusion could reduce demand for Nvidia’s own CPUs. However, he pointed out that at the system level, the feature makes Nvidia’s GPUs more attractive to customers exploring alternative system architectures. While tech rivals AMD, Intel, and Broadcom are notably absent from the Fusion ecosystem, Nvidia’s willingness to work with competitors’ chips could help cement its dominance in AI compute environments, even as the architecture landscape becomes more fragmented.New DGX Cloud platform and Taiwan expansionAlongside NVLink Fusion, Nvidia also introduced the DGX Cloud Lepton, a platform designed to provide developers with access to tens of thousands of GPUs through a unified global marketplace. The system aims to address GPU supply shortages and streamline access to compute capacity across Nvidia’s cloud network.In a regional boost, Huang also announced plans for a new office and AI supercomputer project in Taiwan in collaboration with Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group. The move reinforces Taiwan’s role as a global AI hub and expands Nvidia’s presence in Asia, a critical market for its supply chain and ecosystem partners, including chip foundry TSMC.The upcoming GB300 Grace Blackwell system, scheduled for release in Q3 2025, will offer a leap in performance for AI workloads and further complement Nvidia’s evolving product stack.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:572977b64094b:0-nvidia-opens-nvlink-fusion-ecosystem-expands-taiwan-footprint-with-foxconn/
Malaysia government not involved in local AI project involving Huawei chips,1747829410000,"Malaysia's government did not develop, coordinate or endorse an artificial intelligence project involving a local company and Huawei Technologies, its trade ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, backtracking on a previous announcement. The statement followed local media reports on Monday that a Malaysian company, Skyvast Corporation, would deploy Huawei's Ascend chips for the project. The ministry said it wanted ""to clarify that the said initiative was not developed, endorsed, or coordinated by the Government of Malaysia, nor does it form part of any Government-to-Government agreement or nationally mandated technology programme.""Huawei told Reuters that it has not sold any Ascend chips in Malaysia, and the Malaysian government has not purchased any of those chips from them. Huawei developed the Ascend chips after it was blocked by the U.S. government from receiving advanced semiconductors. The chips have since become an alternative for Chinese firms after Washington moved to further curb sales of high-end chips by top AI chip maker Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA to China. The Trade Ministry added that the country remains committed to fully complying with all applicable export control laws, national security directives, and emerging guidance from global regulatory authorities. Skyvast did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RT0SU:0-malaysia-government-not-involved-in-local-ai-project-involving-huawei-chips/"

"US Chip, Software Giants Enter 'Watershed Moment' in AI Shift to Mideast, Wedbush Says",1747668681000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and other US semiconductor and software giants face a ""watershed moment"" as the artificial intelligence revolution expands to the Middle East, Wedbush Securities said Monday in a note. ""The market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names,"" Wedbush said. President Donald Trump's Middle East trip culminated in deals for the delivery of 18,000 Nvidia chips to Saudi Arabia for a 500-megawatt data center and for the largest AI data center outside the US in Abu Dhabi, the report said. The announcements mark the ""start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,"" said the investment firm. The ""massive AI buildout"" in Saudi Arabia and the UAE might open up a ""huge opportunity"" and total addressable market in the next decade for Nvidia, Palantir Technologies NASDAQ:PLTR , Microsoft, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and other companies, Wedbush said. The tech boom in the Middle East ""also speaks to this global game of high stakes poker being played by the Trump administration"" as China faces US chip restrictions, the report said.

Nvidia's Huang Calls U.S. Export Controls a Failure — WSJ,1747828080000,"By Liza LinTAIPEI — Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said U.S. export controls limiting the sale of advanced chips to China were a failure, contending they have galvanized Beijing to push ahead faster with its own artificial-intelligence technologies.Nvidia has over the past four years lost market share to Chinese competitors because of the restrictions, Huang said.""The local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls give them the spirit, energy and the government support to accelerate their development,"" Huang said Wednesday in Taipei, where he is attending an industry conference.The Biden administration introduced a series of measures crimping the ability of U.S. companies to sell cutting-edge chips, chip-related equipment and technologies to China over national-security concerns. The curbs have particularly affected Nvidia, the leader in chips for AI applications.Many remain in place under President Trump, and the Trump administration added a control in April on the export of an Nvidia AI chip that the company had tailored for sale in China. Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge over the issue.Huang said China was the second-largest computer market globally and would be a $50 billion AI market next year. Revenue from China, he said, could translate to tax dollars and jobs for the U.S.""I think all along the export control was a failure,"" Huang said.At the same time, he praised Trump for reversing one export-control plan that Nvidia had forcefully criticized. In the final days of the Biden administration, officials released a draft of an AI diffusion rule that would have put country caps on the sale of AI chips around the globe, not just to China. The rule was aimed at making it harder for China to access U.S. technology through third countries.The Trump administration rescinded the rule this month before it took effect.""The goal of the AI diffusion rule as specified in the past was to limit AI diffusion. President Trump realizes that it's exactly the wrong goals, "" Huang said.""America is not the only provider of AI technology,"" he said. ""If the United States wants to stay in the lead and the U.S. would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, then we would have to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed.""The removal of the diffusion rule has benefited both Nvidia and countries in places such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia that otherwise would have been curtailed in their ability to build large AI facilities.Days after the rule was pulled, American chip makers including Nvidia unveiled deals to sell hundreds of thousands of the most powerful chips in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar during a visit by Trump and Huang to the region.Huang has crisscrossed the globe over the past month, trying to drum up sales of his AI processors and excitement for his vision of a future driven by AI supercomputers. He has drawn closer to governments around the globe because of the geopolitical importance of AI, standing by Trump's side in the Middle East and meeting senior Chinese officials.Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521002942:0/
What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/
Middle East Seen as Next Theater of AI Revolution — Market Talk,1747668600000,"The next major area of penetration for the AI revolution appears to be the Middle East, Dan Ives and other Wedbush analysts say in a research note. President Trump was recently there to negotiate a deal to have the U.S. tech sector make data centers, supercomputers, software, and overall infrastructure for a massive AI buildout in Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E in the coming years, the analysts say. Saudi Arabia is now due to get 18,000 Nvidia chips for a massive data center while the U.A.E. has Trump's support to guild the largest data center outside of the U.S., two factors that should start an era of new growth for the U.S. tech sector and be a game-changer for the industry, the analysts say.

"Amid 'Jensanity', Nvidia signals plans to keep AI crown",1747989780000,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry, and delivering a subtle but crucial message from the U.S. AI chip king on how it plans to keep its crown. While 'Jensanity' swirled around Huang at the Computex trade fair, Nvidia itself was at a crossroads. Having grown to become the world's most valuable chip company, investors fear a drop in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as damage to sales from U.S. trade friction.U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips and designs inferior alternatives compliant with evolving U.S. policy. Now, cloud computing giants such as Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have signalled cuts to AI spending. And while the 62-year old CEO has in the past month announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars in regions such as the Gulf, analysts said such deals are likely to become scarce.""Is every country going to announce a $10 billion or $50 billion data centre like the Saudis? Of course not,"" said Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg. ""They're sort of running out of obvious deals."" When asked by Reuters how Nvidia planned to deal with AI spending slowdown, Huang said, ""AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world... AI infrastructure is going to be a part of society."" NEW GROWTHAt Computex, Huang revealed a means of growth that does not rely on mega sovereign infrastructure arrangements: new technology that expands Nvidia's grip on the AI market.The tech's centrepiece is called NVLink Fusion. It allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure, thereby becoming a platform upon which others can build. ""Instead of having to build the entire rack of equipment themselves, (companies) could innovate or differentiate on the custom (chip) itself,"" said Nick Kucharewski, vice president at Marvell Technology NASDAQ:MRVL .The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells.Nvidia has also begun to reach into the enterprise market. This week, it launched a line of servers that Huang described as an ""enterprise AI supercomputer"".Huang's pitch was that the servers open up a multi-billion dollar market because customers can use them for ""everything"", such as graphics, virtual machines and AI applications. The enterprise market is large but difficult to break into, said Seaport Research's Goldberg. Deals tend to be small - compared with a sovereign data centre - and more expensive and time-consuming to win.""My sense is we're sort of bumping up against the limits of expanding the customer base,"" Goldberg said.TAIWAN ECOSYSTEM Nvidia works with some of Taiwan's biggest names in tech, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TWSE:2330 , which makes many of its chips. However, the underlying infrastructure for AI would not be possible without the hundreds of Taiwanese companies big and small supplying components and manufacturing know-how needed to construct Nvidia's complex AI systems.""The purpose of Computex was to bring together the ecosystem and the supply chain,"" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consultancy More Than Moore.Such a network is necessary to support the deals announced in the Gulf and that are likely coming elsewhere in the world in the coming months, Cutress said.Taiwanese industry has embraced Huang, who is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old.By the time he flew out on Friday, Huang had appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive, including Chairman Young Liu of AI server builder Foxconn TWSE:2317 who called him the ""leader of Team Taiwan"".MediaTek TWSE:2454 CEO Rick Tsai gave Huang chunks of guava in a plastic bag from the Nvidia leader's favoured fruit stall in Taipei during one of the chip designer's events.Solomon Technology TWSE:2359 , a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions which uses Nvidia's software tools, said working with Nvidia is a win-win situation.Shares of Solomon have surged 241% since Huang mentioned the firm at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in March last year.""The collaboration with Nvidia has given us greater visibility. We weren't very well-known before, but with Nvidia's support, many more people know us now,"" said Solomon Chairman Johnny Chen.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RV068:0-amid-jensanity-nvidia-signals-plans-to-keep-ai-crown/"

Zoom Gears Up to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?,1747666740000,"Zoom Communications ZM is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 21.Zoom expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues between $1.162 billion and $1.167 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of $1.29-$1.31.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ZM’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $1.16 billion, indicating a 2.03% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $1.30 per share, which has remained unchanged over the past 90 days. The figure suggests a 3.70% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.ZM surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.33%. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)Zoom Communications, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZoom Communications, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zoom Communications, Inc. QuoteLet us see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe expansion of Zoom’s AI Companion capabilities is anticipated to have played a major role in boosting the company’s top-line performance. With the launch of AI Companion 2.0 and the rollout of the customizable add-on in April, Zoom began to monetize its agentic AI features. These innovations are likely to have improved customer stickiness and platform engagement in the quarter under review, directly benefiting the top line.Enterprise is expected to have continued being the dominant growth driver. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, enterprise revenues grew 6% year over year and accounted for 60% of total revenues. The number of customers generating over $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenues grew 7% year over year, while churn rates reached record lows. This trend is expected to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supported by continued momentum in Zoom Phone, Contact Center, and Workvivo, particularly as large deals likely ramped up.The Online business segment, which includes SMB and individual customers, is expected to have remained flat to slightly down during the quarter. This performance reflects ongoing stabilization trends, including record-low churn levels achieved in the previous quarter. In contrast, Zoom’s Enterprise segment is anticipated to have carried the bulk of the growth in the fiscal first quarter. Large deal wins, such as the deployment of Zoom solutions to Amazon employees and Delta Airlines' adoption of Workvivo, is expected to have reinforced the platform’s relevance and appeal to upmarket clients.From a bottom-line perspective, strategic investments in AI are expected to have weighed on gross margins, though the company remains committed to achieving long-term efficiency gains. Zoom’s federated AI approach and infrastructure optimization efforts are expected to have helped offset these costs in the fiscal first quarter, keeping operating margins stable near 39%. Additionally, free cash flow in the quarter under review is expected to have been impacted by timing differences, tax conditions and changes in interest rates.What Our Model Says for ZMPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.ZM currently has an Earnings ESP of -1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Can the quarterly figures catapult the shares in the black? 📉 Nvidia in Red in 2025- Nvidia stock NASDAQ:NVDA was gyrating 4% under the flatline for the year Thursday as traders and investors were cautiously waiting for the company’s first-fiscal quarter 2026 earnings report. - Coming Wednesday, May 28, after the closing bell, this one’s going to be a massive event that could shake the fabric of the stock market. 🧐 The Figures: Big Hopes- Investors are looking for Nvidia to pull off another blockbuster print — or risk deeper doubt that the AI-fueled rally can keep pace. - Expectations are high: the Street is eyeballing earnings per share of $0.73, up from $0.61 a year earlier, and a staggering, record $43.3 billion in revenue versus $26 billion picked up at the same time last year. 🥊 $5.5 Billion Hit- There’s also a potential hit that could weigh on Nvidia’s top and bottom lines. The chipmaker recently disclosed a $5.5 billion writeoff tied to H20 chips designed for the Chinese market. Why? US export controls torpedoed Nvidia’s ability to sell them. - That painful loss — even for a company with Nvidia’s firepower — raises questions about the vital China exposure and whether that part of the business can be made whole. 🎤 Hear It from the Man Himself- Besides the actual performance figures for the quarter, markets will be tuning in to hear from the man himself. Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, will be speaking to shareholders, presenting the roadmap and laying out the forward guidance. - Is there a pivot in play to replace lost China revenue? What’s the status of AI chip demand in other markets? But also, what’s up with the shift to selling to whole nations as a way to diversify away from selling to Big Tech? 🎨 New Revenue Streams in the Works- That’s the potentially bullish case. Nvidia is expanding its footprint in the Middle East . The company has been deepening ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where sovereign-backed AI investments are ramping up. - While it’s early innings, Wall Street will be eager to hear whether Gulf demand can help fill the China gap — and whether it will show up on the revenue line this year or next.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:854a3c676094b:0-nvda-nvidia-stock-in-the-red-for-the-year-ahead-of-big-earnings-update-here-s-what-to-expect/
Market Chatter: Crusoe Receives $11.6 Billion in Funding for OpenAI Data Center in Texas,1747825916000,"Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's partner Crusoe has received $11.6 billion in new funding commitments for a data center in Abilene, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The funding, which will come from a mixture of debt and equity provided by Blue Owl Capital (OWL) and Crusoe, will expand the data center to eight buildings from its previously planned two, each equipped with up to 50,000 Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Blackwell chips, the report said. Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle NYSE:ORCL agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI agreed to rent servers from Oracle while Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips, according to the report. OpenAI, Blue Owl, Crusoe, and Oracle did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250521:A3382614:0/
Pre-Markets in Red on Rating Downgrade Concerns,1747666320000,"Pre-market futures are down to start a new trading week, following five-straight up-sessions for the S&P 500. Last week, optimism on the tariff front took over, as talks between the U.S. and China appeared to be making progress. But over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reminded us that if there are no trade deals after the 90-day pause, the reciprocal tariffs — many of them quite draconian — go back on.Also, harkening back to Friday, Moody’s followed Fitch and S&P in downgrading U.S. credit — from AAA to AA1. Concerns over an increasing debt and larger fiscal deficits led to the move, and we now see bond yield rates going up as a result. Both 10-year and 2-year are up on the news — to +4.55% and +4.02%, respectively — as well as the 30-year yield, which has breached +5% for the first time since late 2023.Thus, we are seeing some give-back in pre-market trading this morning. The Dow is currently -230 points, the S&P 500 is -60 and the Nasdaq -300. The small-cap Russell 2000 is -28 points at this hour. All four indexes are still up double-digits over the past month (off a low base) but are back into the red year-to-date.What to Expect from the Stock Market TodayCompared to recent weeks, we quiet down on the economic report front. Today we’ll get a look at U.S. Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) after the market opens for the month of April. Expectations are for the fifth-straight down-month to -0.9%, from -0.7% reported a month ago.What’s in Store for the Trading WeekWe do see major retailers reporting earnings this week, as the final leg of calendar Q1 earnings season winds down. On Tuesday, we’ll get numbers from Home Depot HD, and Wednesday will bring us Target TGT, Lowe’s LOW and TJX Stores TJX. Also homebuilder Toll Brothers TOL and cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks PANW will report. Chip giant NVIDIA NVDA still doesn’t report until next week.This week will bring us, in addition to LEI, S&P flash Services and Manufacturing PMI for May come out. Also New and Existing Home Sales, and Thursday morning’s Weekly Jobless Claims will hit the tape.

Cathie Wood Returns to Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) With $8.4M in Fresh Buys,1747950119000,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is circling back to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM, Financials), picking up $8.4 million worth of shares on May 20 across two ETFs. That came just a day after a much larger $38.4 million purchasesignaling renewed interest in a stock Ark had been pulling away from last year.It's more than a rebound trade. With some easing in U.S.China tensions and a renewed push for AI chips, Wood seems to be repositioning. TSM is a behind-the-scenes force in the chip world, supplying heavyweights like Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Apple (AAPL, Financials), Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials), and AMD (AMD, Financials).Shares are still slightly down this year, but that may have opened a window. Ark has long leaned into buying during market dips, and this time is no different. Even as the firm builds up its TSM stake, it hasn't stepped away from Nvidia. NVDA remains a core holding across multiple Ark funds.Ark's moves suggest a broader view: that both design leaders and manufacturing giants will ride the AI wavetogether.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:d13d48c21094b:0-cathie-wood-returns-to-taiwan-semiconductor-tsm-with-8-4m-in-fresh-buys/

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent. Higher yields tend to compress valuations for growth stocks, which rely on future earnings.Read more: Adani, Tata, Vedanta make a power play for coal-fired projects after five-year lullThe downbeat session came just after markets closed out a stellar week.

The Nasdaq had rallied over 7 percent last week, while the S&P 500 gained more than 5 percent over five straight sessions. The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone. Walmart shares slipped 1.7 percent after President Trump suggested the retailer should shoulder the burden of tariffs, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said CEO Doug McMillon had agreed to absorb some levies. Netflix dropped 2 percent after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral, citing its sharp rally. Reddit fell nearly 7 percent after Wells Fargo flagged long-term risks from AI-powered search displacing traditional web traffic, cutting the stock to equal weight.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion Ups the Ante for AI Infrastructure,1747663620000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NVDA] NVIDIA’s NASDAQ:NVDA CEO, Jensen Huang , made numerous announcements at the Computex 2025 conference that amount to one thing: NVIDIA remains at the center of all things AI. While competitors advance their technologies, they remain steps behind and may never catch up due to this critical factor: NVIDIA launched NVLink Fusion .NVIDIA NVLink is the technology linking NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs into functional supercomputers. It is the framework upon which most AI data centers are built and is now open to third-party manufacturers. Until now, NVIDIA GPUs were linked using NVIDIA’s NVLink and NVIDIA CPUs. Now, NVIDIA GPUs can be linked with third-party CPUs and ASICs, increasing the options for building semi-custom AI infrastructure and opening new revenue streams for NVIDIA.The system works with an NVIDIA chiplet that can be integrated into any ASIC or CPU. The initial announcement included commitments from numerous  semiconductor manufacturers already planning to use the technology, and more, eventually all, are expected to join the network over time. Other critical announcements at the Computex 2025 conference include updates to existing technology , upcoming product launches , and services for AI developers . The crucial product update is the RTX Pro Server , which is now in volume production. It increases performance roughly 2x to 4x, depending on the AI model, compared to the original H100 AI GPU .Other updates include the expected launch of GB300 systems later this year, an advancement of the Grace Blackwell product line , and DGX Cloud Lepton , an SaaS service linking AI developers with crucial cloud resources and computing power. NVIDIA Analysts Raise Revenue Estimates Ahead of Q1 ReleaseNVIDIA will report strong results for Q1 2025 and provide robust guidance for the year. The Computex 2025 announcements reaffirm the existing outlook and provide additional revenue streams, including a new project with Foxconn . Foxconn, a supplier to Apple , will build an advanced AI supercomputer in Taiwan using 10,000 of NVIDIA’s GPUs. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NVDA] The project will provide computing power for Taiwanese businesses, including Taiwan Semiconductor . The takeaway for investors is that analysts expect to see NVIDIA provide solid results and guidance and lift their targets ahead of the release. MarketBeat's consensus in late May is up nearly 500 basis points month-to-month, forecasting more than 65% growth on the top line . The analysts’ trends in April and May included sufficient price target reductions to land the stock on MarketBeat’s Most Dowgraded Stocks list, but investors need to look past that label. The consensus remains bullish, rated firmly at a Moderate Buy with  coverage increasing and sentiment firming , and the price target assumes that more than 20% upside is still available.The Computex announcements are a catalyst, likely to lead the analysts to revert to price target increases and spur the rally back into action. As it is, the $165 price target is sufficient for a new all-time high likely reached in tandem or shortly after the Q1 earnings report. NVIDIA’s Industry-Leading Position in AI Is Assured for Another Few YearsThe net result of NVIDIA's May 2025 news, including the deals in Saudi Arabia , is that its position as the AI industry leader is assured for another few years, highlighting the deep value opportunity that is still available. The stock trades at only 31x its current year earnings compared to over 45x in recent years, and only 20x compared to the 2030 forecast and 12x relative to 20235, suggesting significant gains lie ahead.Assuming the company only performs as expected over the next decade, it could rise by another 100% to 200% to trade in the range of 24x to 36x its 2035 forecast. The technical action in May is bullish . Although macroeconomic headwinds remain and market action is volatile, the rebound is strong and on track to retest all-time highs soon. A move to new highs would be significant, indicating a shift in market dynamics from wait-and-see into rally mode, and bring targets near $160 into play . Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f1cf434cc094b:0-nvidia-s-nvlink-fusion-ups-the-ante-for-ai-infrastructure/
"Nvidia Remains 'Best Positioned' in AI Despite China Export Restrictions, Oppenheimer Says",1747940319000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA remains ""best positioned"" in artificial intelligence despite the loss of H20 chip sales to China following US government restrictions, Oppenheimer said in a Thursday note. The firm said it sees upside to the company's fiscal Q1 results due next week and expects the company to issue fiscal Q2 outlook in line with analyst expectations. Oppenheimer expects the chipmaker to report fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings of $0.92 per share, up from its previous forecast of $0.91. Segment wise, the firm said it expects the data center business to record a 71% increase in revenue year-over-year thanks to ""robust demand"" for the company's GB200 AI systems. Oppenheimer said production of the flagship rack-scale systems appears to have moved past initial growing pains. The firm said it also sees sovereign AI as a growing portion of Nvidia's revenue, with China representing a total addressable market of $50 billion. The firm expects a potential China-compliant SKU from Nvidia in July. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously called US export restrictions on AI chips to China a ""failure,"" saying the measures have prompted Chinese firms to shift purchases to domestic chipmakers, including Huawei. Still, as recently as Wednesday, the White House said it would maintain its efforts to prevent advanced AI technology from reaching China, rebuffing Huang's call for relief. China currently represents less than 5% of Nvidia's sales, Oppenheimer said. The firm reiterated an outperform rating on the stock and $175 price target. Shares were up 1.7% in recent trading.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250522:A3383982:0/
Bull of the Day: D-Wave Quantum (QBTS),1747819200000,"D-Wave Quantum QBTS shares soared over 25% on Tuesday after the company announced its next-generation Advantage quantum computing system.Featuring D-Wave's most advanced quantum processor to date, the Advantage2 system is commercial-grade, and built to address real-world use cases in areas such as optimization, materials simulation and artificial intelligence (AI).But the immediate breakthrough might be that customers will be able to access Advantage2 initially only through D-Wave's Leap cloud service. This marks the first instance of quantum-as-a-service.Quantum Completes the TriumvirateD-Wave CEO Alan Baratz emphasized in the company's Q1 earnings release two weeks ago that they ""became the first to demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computing on a useful real-world problem.""From the May 8 press release...Published the peer-reviewed paper “Beyond-Classical Computation in Quantum Simulation” in Science, validating D-Wave’s demonstration of quantum computational supremacy on a useful real-world problem. This research showed that D-Wave’s annealing quantum computer was able to perform a magnetic materials simulation in minutes that would take nearly one million years and more than the world’s electricity supply on one of today’s most powerful classical supercomputers, the Frontier massively parallel, GPU-based exascale supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This claim met resistance from some technology observers who debated the apples vs. oranges comparisons. But the accomplishments of D-Wave should not be so easily dismissed as there is definitely a ""there, there"" under the surface. As we learned from NVIDIA NVDA CEO Jensen Huang and other quantum experts recently at the first ever NVIDIA Quantum Summit in March, the world's most advanced computers will use a combination of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs, or quantum computing units.QPUs are not only very far from competing with GPUs, they will likely never replace them. And Jensen made sure everyone knew that when he graciously invited those leaders for a pow-wow, a month after completely dismissing the nascent industry.You can learn more about that exciting and controversial event in a podcast I did with Neena Mishra in March... Quantum Computing: Tech's Next Giant Leap?D-Wave's outspoken CEO Baratz sat next to Jensen and you could only cut the tension with a laser. But Baratz had already acknowledged that quantum systems will work in tandem with GPU-based AI, and he proved it with the company's first big sale in February.D-Wave made a big splash in the quantum computing space with their first sale of an Advantage annealing quantum computing system to a high-performance computing (HPC) center, the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), about 54 kilometers west of Cologne, Germany.As Europe’s first and only exascale HPC, the JSC JUPITER supercomputer will utilize D-Wave's Advantage system to facilitate breakthroughs in AI and quantum optimization applications.JUPITER is expected to surpass the threshold of one exaFLOP, or one quintillion floating point operations per second. This will be the world’s first coupling of an annealing quantum computer with an exascale supercomputer, providing a first-of-a-kind opportunity for tackling the world's toughest computational problems.Advantage2 Raises the BarThe Advantage2 system is expected to deliver significant performance gains and efficiency with doubled coherence, increased connectivity and a 40% boost to the energy scale for advanced problem solving.In addition to the Jülich Supercomputing Center, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has already been using prototypes of the new Advantage2 system to advance their research. A LANL engineer and Dale Moore, President and CEO of defense contractor Davidson Technologies, both were quoted in the press release regarding their enthusiasm for continued R&D.Davidson, located in Huntsville, Alabama is a trusted provider of advanced engineering and technical solutions supporting the U.S. Department of Defense, intelligence community, and aerospace industry. With a focus on mission-driven innovation, Davidson combines deep domain knowledge with emerging technologies to solve the nation’s most complex defense challenges.Ahead of this announcement, QBTS shares were already a Zacks #2 Rank because EPS estimates had moved significantly higher between the company's last two quarterly reports, with the full-year 2025 bottom line rising from a loss of 38-cents to only -$0.21.After the Q1 sale to JSC, D-Wave had bragging rights of a 500% jump in revenues on an admittedly small base. Before Tuesday's announcement, full-year 2025 sales were projected to cross $25 million, representing 183% growth.So it's fair to say that with a meteoric 125%+ gain in just 9 trading sessions, investors will be looking for increased sales and clarity on the expected delivery of physical Advantage2 systems -- or if margins will be better with the Leap cloud service.Large hyperscalers (think Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and even Meta and Tesla) and other supercomputing research centers aiming to integrate quantum computing into their infrastructure will definitely want the Advantage2 system in a dedicated on-premise configuration.Qatar Goes Full QuantumAnother fortunate trade wind for D-Wave this past week may be the sizable investments and partnerships being lavished on a private competitor.Quantinuum, the private quantum-computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, finalized a $1 billion agreement with a Qatari investment firm last week. That number is spread over a decade, but it does show a commitment to the technology that has not been seen in the revenues of any of the companies yet.It was thought last year that Quantinuum might fetch a valuation as high as $10 billion if it IPOs this year. That estimate is probably higher now, and driving more investors to bet on the ponies already running on the public track, including Rigetti Computing RGTI and IonQ IONQ.Rigetti was a big winner for members of my TAZR Trader portfolio recently where we took gains of 1,340% and 703%. And IonQ has been of particular interest in my special report Beyond AI: The Quantum Leap in Computing Power because it utilizes the same technology approach as Quantinuum known as ""trapped ion"" computation.After Tuesday's rally in D-Wave shares, TAZR is sitting on open gains of over 1,600% in QBTS.Future's So Fast, You Gotta Wear a HelmetWriting for Barron's on May 15, Mackenzie Tatananni explained the ""ramping global demand"" for the technology.""Quantum computing is often seen as a speculative bet by investors and detractors could argue that its appearance alongside sectors like defense and energy was a surprise. However, the announcement was just another sign that enthusiasm for the technology continues to mount, both in the U.S. and abroad.""Quantinuum said its joint venture agreement with Al Rabban Capital would accelerate the adoption of quantum technology in Qatar and the surrounding region.The 10-year investment horizon includes training new developers and enabling access to Quantinuum's systems. As we've learned with NVIDIA, getting developers on-board and building in the platform ecosystem is key to further adoption across corporations and countries.The partners plan to develop regional-specific uses of quantum in fields such as finance, precision medicine, and genomics, both for academic and industrial clients.Bottom line: While the stock valuations of QBTS, RGTI, and IONQ may be ahead of their revenues, there is excitement among investors big and small, from Qatar to Queens, that QPUs will change the world as fast GPUs in the coming decade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ede8fd1e6094b:0-bull-of-the-day-d-wave-quantum-qbts/

French tech companies, including Mistral AI and Poolside, raised $7.8 billion last year, less than London’s $11.3 billion.Europe has been falling behind other regions in tech innovations, with only some countries trying to boost tech investments.While the market capitalisation of global tech, media and telecom companies rose from $7 trillion in 2000 to $34 trillion last year, Europe's share dropped from 30% to just 7%, a McKinsey report said on Wednesday. If Europe had maintained its share, it would have generated an additional $8 trillion in market value, it said.Paris is also the only European city on Dealroom's top five global champions list, which is dominated by U.S. cities.It comes a month ahead of Paris hosting one of the largest global tech conferences, VivaTech, featuring top executives from companies such as Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Alibaba NYSE:BABA , Meta NASDAQ:META , OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic and Cohere. Last year's conference was attended by more than 165,000 people.""It's not just about the competitiveness of Paris on the AI scene today, it's also about what will happen next and how we can keep on attracting the talent, investment, and the tech activities,"" Francois Bitouzet, managing director of VivaTech, told Reuters.Since coming to power in 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron has talked about wanting France to be a world leader in AI and 'deep-tech', inviting several firms to invest in the country and pushing for creation of startup incubator Station F.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RS15D:0-paris-named-as-europe-s-leading-tech-ecosystem-beating-london/"
"Billionaire Druckenmiller Dumps Nvidia and Palantir, Loads Up on TSMC",1747931668000,"May 22 - Stanley Druckenmiller (Trades, Portfolio)'s Duquesne Family Office sold its entire stake in Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Palantir Technologies NASDAQ:PLTR , while snapping up shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing NYSE:TSM , according to a recent SEC filing.The fund offloaded 9.5 million Nvidia shares and about 770,000 Palantir shares between mid-2023 and early 2025. In Q1 2025, it bought 491,265 TSMC shares, boosting that position by roughly 457% since year-end.Market watchers say growing competition in AI chips likely drove the Nvidia exit. Meanwhile, Palantir's steep valuation, trading at more than 100 times sales, may have looked stretched.TSMC's diverse customer base, from AMD to Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , and its role in everything from data-center accelerators to smartphone processors, probably appealed to Druckenmiller as a steadier bet.This move suggests Druckenmiller is shifting toward a more balanced AI play with broader exposure and less risk.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:15342bf2e094b:0-billionaire-druckenmiller-dumps-nvidia-and-palantir-loads-up-on-tsmc/

OpenAI and Nvidia back $100B Stargate AI project in UAE,1747930110000,"The United Arab Emirates is set to become a central player in global artificial intelligence infrastructure as tech giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, and Cisco partner with Emirati firm G42 to build one of the largest AI campuses in the world. The Stargate UAE project, confirmed by the companies on Thursday, will be located in Abu Dhabi and marks the international expansion of a sweeping AI development programme launched earlier this year by the Trump administration. The site is expected to span 10 square miles and feature a 5-gigawatt capacity, with its first 200-megawatt AI cluster scheduled to go live in 2026.UAE project part of Trump-era $100B AI infrastructure dealThe Stargate UAE initiative stems from a joint infrastructure commitment announced in January by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The US-led plan initially pledged $100 billion in funding for domestic data centre projects and later expanded with an additional $500 billion earmarked for global efforts through 2029. The UAE campus will be the first major overseas project under this framework, directly supporting the administration’s strategy to build secure, decentralised AI infrastructure with allied nations.President Donald Trump, during his Middle East visit last week, unveiled a series of commercial AI deals, including the UAE venture.The collaboration aims to support not only US national AI resilience but also to offer trusted infrastructure to allied governments seeking advanced compute capacity.OpenAI and Oracle to manage 1 GW of computeUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Oracle will jointly operate a 1-gigawatt compute cluster, with G42 leading construction and deployment. Nvidia will supply high-performance AI chips, while Cisco is tasked with providing networking and connectivity solutions for the site. The firms said that the first phase will activate in 2026 with 200 megawatts of AI compute, which will be scaled up to full capacity in phases.OpenAI noted the partnership is part of its broader initiative to build AI facilities that promote responsible use while strengthening US-aligned digital infrastructure abroad. Oracle, which already has cloud operations in the region, is expected to integrate Stargate into its international cloud network, allowing the UAE campus to serve as a key node in global AI compute availability.UAE emerges as AI infrastructure hubThe Stargate UAE project positions the Gulf nation as a critical AI hub amid a broader push by the UAE government to diversify its economy and accelerate digital transformation. G42, which has partnered with OpenAI since 2023, is a major player in the UAE’s tech ecosystem, overseeing AI projects spanning healthcare, smart cities, and defence. The new campus will build on this foundation and contribute to local upskilling, energy innovation, and regional AI adoption.The partnership also aligns with Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment goals, allowing it to anchor AI infrastructure in the Middle East with support from US technology leaders. While the project highlights growing ties between US firms and the Gulf state, it also comes as global tech supply chains shift, particularly in data centre energy sourcing and chip availability.International rollout follows 16-state US expansion planIn February, OpenAI revealed it was evaluating sites in 16 US states to build similar data centre campuses as part of the original $100 billion initiative. The UAE project marks the first confirmed international site, although more are expected to follow as the programme expands.By combining sovereign funding with private sector leadership, the Stargate series of projects represents one of the largest coordinated AI infrastructure developments in history. It aims to provide compute access for startups, governments, and enterprises in a secure and geopolitically aligned manner, at a time when demand for AI power is rapidly outpacing current capacity.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:78195b5cf094b:0-openai-and-nvidia-back-100b-stargate-ai-project-in-uae/
Nvidia CEO praises Trump move to scrap some AI export curbs,1747793411000,"U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China were ""a failure"" as they have cost American companies billions of dollars in lost sales, Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on Wednesday.Huang's comments were levelled at the Biden administration's AI diffusion rule that sought to curb exports of sophisticated AI chips by dividing the world into three tiers, with China blocked entirely. The Trump administration has said it is going to modify the rules.""All in all, the export control was a failure,"" Huang said adding, ""The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, in the first place, have been proven to be fundamentally flawed.""The U.S. block on sales of advanced AI chips to China has forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers such as Huawei, while also spurring China to invest aggressively to develop a supply chain that doesn't rely on manufacturers outside the country.The Nvidia chief executive said that despite the U.S. controls, research continues, which requires vast sums of capital to acquire the necessary AI infrastructure.At a press conference at the annual Computex event in Taipei, Huang praised Trump's approach to AI and said by reversing the prior restrictions, the president demonstrated he understands U.S. companies are not the only providers of such technology.""President Trump realises it's exactly the wrong goal,"" he said in reference to the prior rules.From the start of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, Nvidia's China market share has dropped to 50% from 95%, Huang said.Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach to chip export curbs and replacing it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, which could give the U.S. clout in trade talks. 'INTENSE' COMPETITION IN CHINAMore than half the world's AI researchers are based in China and because of the U.S. export controls on AI chips those experts have been forced to turn to local Chinese technology, Huang said.""Our competition in China is really intense,"" Huang said. ""They would love for us never to go back to China.""Huang estimated the entire AI market in China would be worth roughly $50 billion next year, which represented a significant opportunity for the company.At the Computex event, Nvidia announced several new technologies and businesses that will expand its $130.5 billion revenue. The company said in April it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the Trump administration limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.Earlier this week, Huang estimated that the H20-related revenue damage would amount to roughly $15 billion.But Nvidia is working on a version of its current-generation Blackwell AI chip that will include a less speedy form of memory to comply with restrictions on the typical advanced memory included on AI chips, according to two sources familiar with the matter.In 2022, the Biden administration effectively banned exports of advanced microchips and equipment to produce advanced chips by Chinese chipmakers, part of an effort to hobble China's semiconductor industry and in turn the military.After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips such as H20 that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.China on Monday urged the United States to ""immediately correct its wrongdoings"" and stop ""discriminatory"" measures following U.S. guidance warning companies not to use advanced computer chips from China, including Huawei's Ascend AI chips.The U.S. action seriously undermined consensus reached at the high-level bilateral trade talks in Geneva, a statement from China's commerce ministry said, vowing resolute measures if the U.S. continues to ""substantially"" harm China's interests.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT01X:0-nvidia-ceo-praises-trump-move-to-scrap-some-ai-export-curbs/"

These Are the Only 6 Stock Stocks in NVIDIA's 13F Portfolio,1747929420000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NVDA] Many investors closely watch 13F filings from institutional money managers. While chip giant NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA isn’t typically seen in that role, it must file as well, since it manages over $100 million in U.S.-traded securities.Below is a breakdown of the six stocks listed on  NVIDIA’s most recent 13F .Examining these holdings provides insight into the types of technology that this pioneering company is betting on.All return data calculates the change in price through the May 21 close, since NVIDIA revealed its initial stake in these companies, including their initial rise.NVIDIA’s Top 3 Chip and AI Infrastructure Investments Don’t Fall Far From the Tree [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] By far, NVIDIA’s largest 13F holding was CoreWeave NASDAQ:CRWV .CoreWeave accounted for 78% of NVIDIA’s total reported 13F holdings in Q1.Aside from owning approximately 7% of CoreWeave, the company is also one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers. CoreWeave uses its close relationship with NVIDIA to rent out the company’s most advanced AI chips to customers before anyone else.On its last earnings call, CoreWeave said it was the first to deploy NVIDIA’s GB200 Grace Blackwell systems at scale.Since going public in March, CoreWeave has increased by a staggering 169%, driven largely by the excitement surrounding its  NVIDIA relationship . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] The next two largest NVIDIA 13F holdings are Arm NASDAQ:ARM and Applied Digital NASDAQ:APLD .They represent around 10% and 4% of NVIDIA’s total $1.15 billion 13F portfolio . NVIDIA actually tried to fully acquire ARM in 2020 for $40 billion; however, the transaction fell through due to regulatory issues.ARM provides “IP cores,"" essentially the basic designs of chips that companies base their advanced chips on.As such, ARM is a very important but somewhat underappreciated player in semiconductors. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:APLD] Applied Digital is somewhat similar to CoreWeave, renting out computing power to customers.However, it still gets a good amount of its revenue from cryptocurrency miners , something that CoreWeave no longer dabbles in.The company is also tiny, comparatively, worth only around $1.5 billion.Since November 2024, when  NVIDIA first reported owning Applied Digital , the stock is down approximately 1%.AI-Drug Research, Computing, & Autonomous Driving Round Out NVIDIA’s 13F Portfolio [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:RXRX] NVIDIA’s fourth largest 13F holding is the clinical-stage drug company, Recursion Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ:RXRX .The company has no medicines approved by regulators yet, and thus doesn’t generate much revenue.Overall, the company’s free cash flow over the last 12 months was around -$400 million.The company is attempting to use AI to accelerate drug discovery and development.Importantly,  Recursion is an NVIDIA customer that uses the firm’s chips to power its supercomputer to achieve its mission.It is prioritizing work on four cancer treatments and two rare disease treatments.Even after jumping 24% the day NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February 2024, shares are down 51%. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NBIS] NVIDIA’s final two holdings are Nebius Group NASDAQ:NBIS and WeRide NASDAQ:WRD , each making up around 2% of its portfolio.Nebius’s business model is also very similar to CoreWeave’s, which is renting out AI computing power. Like CoreWeave, it is also seeing incredible revenue growth , reporting a 385% increase in sales in Q1.Nebius will be among the first companies that will offer NVIDIA’s new Blackwell Ultra AI factory platform.Despite rising 7% on the day the initial NVIDIA investment came out, investors have seen shares drop nearly 7% overall. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:WRD] Last up is WeRide. The company operates a variety of robotaxis and other autonomous driving vehicle platforms, primarily in China.WeRide uses NVIDIA’s advanced chips to operate its technology.Even including the 83% surge in shares after NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February, they have fallen nearly 40% overall since then as of May 21.NVIDIA’s 13F Holdings: Prudent Examination Still Reigns SupremeThere is one clear common thread among all these companies in which NVIDIA is investing : they are either customers or suppliers of NVIDIA. This makes sense considering that NVIDIA would deeply understand their businesses.Overall, having investments from NVIDIA doesn't mean investors should blindly follow behind the tech giant and invest in these stocks.This is especially true as merely associating with NVIDIA can often drive wild up moves in these names, only to see their shares crater back to earth.Still, NVIDIA's investment is a positive, and directing a watchful eye toward these names makes sense.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:35d463924094b:0-these-are-the-only-6-stock-stocks-in-nvidia-s-13f-portfolio/

A new downgraded chip is in the works as Nvidia seeks to retain footing in a critical growth market.Revenue from China totaled $17 billion in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2025, representing 13% of Nvidia's total sales. The H20 chip was the only remaining product in the Hopper series legally permitted for export to China under U.S. rules.Huang confirmed in a livestream that no further Hopper updates are possible, stating, It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore, according to Taiwan's Formosa TV.The company is expected to release a downgraded H20 chip within two months, according to earlier reports from Reuters, to help regain lost market share from competitors like Huawei.The Biden administration's Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, issued in January 2025, imposed new export restrictions, which have been criticized by Huang. He argued that the U.S. should focus on maximizing the global reach of its technologies rather than restricting exports.President Donald Trump has pledged to revoke those rules, calling them counterproductive to U.S. interests in global tech leadership.Huang visited China shortly after the H20 restrictions took effect, signaling Nvidia's ongoing commitment to the region despite tightened rules.- See insider trades for NVDA - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6ef65823d094b:0-nvidia-nvda-ends-hopper-ai-chip-line-for-china-amid-u-s-export-curbs/

"These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Moderna, Home Depot, Tesla, CATL, Nvidia, D-Wave Quantum, Viking Holdings, and More — Barrons.com",1747772880000,"By Joe Woelfel, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Connor SmithStocks fell Tuesday, as the S&P 500 snapped its six-day winning streak in a slow day for the market.These stocks were making moves:Moderna rose 6.1%. The Food and Drug Administration will stick to its existing process for updating Covid-19 shots for older adults and those at a high risk of severe illness. It's a softer approach than Trump officials had seemed poised to take, according to Barron's reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis.Home Depot, the biggest home-improvement retailer, reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.56 a share, missing analysts' estimates of $3.60. Revenue of $39.9 billion beat forecasts of $39.3 billion. The company said it plans to keep prices unchanged despite new tariffs. Home Depot shares were down 0.6%. Competitor Lowe's, which reports quarterly earnings Wednesday, fell 1.4%.Tesla was up 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk told a conference in Qatar that he expects to still be chief executive in five years, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla shares have declined 15% this year but have jumped about 44% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 22. Tesla sold 11,150 cars in China the past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung, up from 3,040 sold the week before. But that is down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Shares of Tesla supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology, the Chinese battery giant, soared 16% in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday. CATL raised almost $4.6 billion in the world's largest equity offering this year.UnitedHealth gained 1.8%. The shares rose 8.2% on Monday, ending the session at $315.89. It was the stock's largest daily percentage increase since Nov 4, 2020, when it rose more than 10%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock declined 23.3% last week after UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty resigned and the company suspended its 2025 outlook.Nvidia fell 0.9%. CEO Jensen Huang said Monday the company would be opening its artificial-intelligence server platform to rival chip makers but he also warned the U.S. government's move to limit chip exports to China could hit revenue by $15 billion.D-Wave Quantum jumped 26% as its sixth-generation quantum-computing system became available over the cloud. D-Wave management highlighted the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines effectively can handle.Amer Sports rose 19% after the sporting goods and apparel company topped first-quarter adjusted earnings estimates and raised fiscal-year profit guidance.Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained 1.5% to $17.72 after analysts at Evercore ISI upgraded shares of the technology company to Outperform from In Line and raised their price target to $22 from $17.Viking Holdings, the expedition cruises company, reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss on a revenue jump of 25% to $897.1 million. The company said it was seeing ""sustained strength in demand."" Shares, however, declined 5% as analysts questioned whether Viking will be able to sustain pricing growth as the year progresses. Cruise line peers also declined. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings was off 3.9%, Carnival fell 2.1%, and Royal Caribbean was down 1.9%.Earnings reports were expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies, and Toll Brothers.Write to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

President Trump's SALT Bill in Focus,1747926000000,"Well, all week we had been looking for a market catalyst, with economic prints scarce and Q1 earnings season winding down. We finally got it yesterday, with news that the “big, beautiful bill” was about to pass the House — that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk’s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending.However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1. This is before the Senate has gotten its hooks into the bill, and we know changes are going to be made. It has also gotten the attention of the bond market, which is now up over +4.6% on the 10-year, +4.0% on the 2-year and above +5.0% on the 30-year.The 20-year bond option yesterday triggered the mid-day sell-off. Major indexes fell from -1.4% (Nasdaq) to -1.9% (Dow) by yesterday’s close. This morning, we sank temporarily but are climbing at this hour: -120 points on the Dow, -5 on the S&P 500 and +15 points on the Nasdaq. The small-cap Russell 2000, which dropped -2.6% yesterday, is down another -10 points currently.Weekly Jobless Claims Stay In-RangeThankfully, this morning we do have economic reports to parse. Among them, like every normal Thursday, we see Initial Jobless Claims remaining in the groove with a healthy labor environment, at 227K — 2000 lower than the unrevised 229K reported for the previous week. Every several weeks or so we tend to see a pop above 240K, but always come back down in the subsequent prints.Continuing Claims came in at 1.903 million — above the psychological threshold of 1.9 million, but which has been revised down below it in all but one week of 2025 so far. This follows a downwardly revised 1.87 million from the prior week (these longer-term claims are reported a week behind initial claims). With aging workers taking their pink slips as a sign to call it a career, along with ex-federal employees currently living on severance packages, the long-awaited pressure on the labor market has been mild at worst to this point.Earnings Reports Ahead of Today’s Open: RL, BJThe parade of retailers reporting quarterly earnings continues this morning, with upscale retailer Ralph Lauren RL outpacing fiscal Q4 earnings estimates by 3 cents to $2.03 per share, on $1.70 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $1.63 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares are up modestly on the news, adding to the stock’s +18% gains year to date.Down the tax bracket a bit, BJ’s Wholesale BJ put up mixed numbers in its Q1 earnings report this morning. Earnings of $1.14 per share amounted to a nice beat on the bottom line, above the 91 cents analysts were expecting. Revenues, on the other hand, came in -0.5% from expectations to $5.15 billion. But reaffirming forward guidance has kept the stock up +2% this morning, adding to its +31% gains year to date.What to Expect in the Stock Market TodayAfter the opening bell, we’ll see S&P flash PMI for both Services and Manufacturing for the month of May. While both are expected to tick down a tad, Services is expected to remain above the 50-threshold (between growth and loss) and Manufacturing is anticipated to dip back below it.Existing Home Sales for April are expected to come in somewhat stronger: 4.13 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units versus 4.02 million posted a month ago. We have seen more homes come on line for sale of late, but off a very scarce base overall. New Home Sales, which come out tomorrow, are expected to slide back a bit.Also, earnings continues the final leg of its tour for the quarter, with Workday WDAY, AutoDesk ADSK and Deckers Outdoor DECK coming out with results after today’s close.

German chipmaker Infineon to work with Nvidia on power delivery chips ,1747767578000,"German chipmaker Infineon XETR:IFX said on Tuesday it will work with Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA on developing chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centers.Infineon said it will work with Nvidia to develop high-voltage, direct current power delivery systems. In current data centers, most high-voltage power is distributed as alternating current and then converted to the direct current needed by computer chips by individual power supply units inside of servers. But that method of distributing power introduces losses in moving power around and converting it. With each server rack within AI data centers expected to take a megawatt of power by the end of the decade, Infineon and Nvidia said they are hoping to reduce those losses by creating a centralized direct-current distribution system. “Through this innovative approach, Nvidia is able to optimize the energy consumption of our advanced AI infrastructure, which supports our commitment to sustainability while also delivering the performance and scalability required for the next generation of AI workloads,” Gabriele Gorla, vice president of system engineering at Nvidia, said in a statement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RS0Q4:0-german-chipmaker-infineon-to-work-with-nvidia-on-power-delivery-chips/"
Semtech to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards for the Stock?,1747924560000,"Semtech Corporation SMTC is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2026 results after market close on May 27.For first-quarter fiscal 2026, Semtech expects net sales of $250 million (+/- $5 million), indicating 21% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $249.79 million, indicating a rise of 21.20% from the year-ago quarter.SMTC anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share to be 37 cents (+/- 3 cents).

The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics ,1747763100000,"Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we’ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the “World’s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.”As this trend gains traction, it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we’ll explore four stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), the Global X Robotics & AI ETF (BOTZ) and Tesla (TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolutionGrowth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it’s a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world’s most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla’s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia ,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia’s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank’s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don’t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfd373905094b:0-the-next-major-tech-stock-trend-humanoid-robotics/

"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/
'Stargate UAE' AI datacenter to begin operation in 2026,1747922400000,"The first phase of a massive new artificial data center in the United Arab Emirates will come online in 2026, likely with 100,000 Nvidia chips.The ""Stargate UAE"" project is part of a deal brokered last week by U.S. President Donald Trump to build the world's largest set of AI data centers outside the United States, despite previous U.S. restrictions on sending advanced technology to the UAE because of its close ties to China.The 10-square-mile (26-sq-km) site in Abu Dhabi will eventually host 5 gigawatts worth of data centers.The first phase of that project will be the 1-gigawatt Stargate UAE project, built by state-backed UAE firm G42 in partnership with U.S. firms OpenAI, Oracle NYSE:ORCL , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Cisco Systems NASDAQ:CSCO , as well as Japan's SoftBank Group TSE:9984 . The companies on Thursday said that the Stargate UAE project will use Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, currently the most advanced AI server that Nvidia offers.The first 200 megawatts of capacity will go live in 2026, the companies said. The group did not give a number of servers, but analyst firm TrendForce estimates that GB300 servers with 72 chips each consume about 140-kilowatts of power, which equates to about 1,400 servers or 100,000 Nvidia chips.This first-in-the-world platform will enable every UAE government agency and commercial institution to connect their data to the world's most advanced AI models,"" Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief technology officer and chairman, said in a statement.The Trump administration earlier this month rescinded a rule put in place by President Joe Biden that would have restricted the flow of AI chips to countries such as the UAE. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has not said what will replace the rule but said last week that it will convene a working group between the U.S. and UAE to ensure that the project meets ""robust U.S. security standards and other efforts to responsibly deploy AI infrastructure, both in the UAE and globally.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RT0Y9:0-stargate-uae-ai-datacenter-to-begin-operation-in-2026/"

NVIDIA vs. Super Micro: Which AI Hardware Stock Should You Bet On?,1747747080000,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has ignited a race among hardware suppliers, and two of the most prominent names riding this wave are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI. NVIDIA dominates the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market, while Super Micro rides the same wave by designing ultra-efficient, NVIDIA’s chip-optimized servers for hyperscalers and enterprises.Both stocks have delivered exceptional returns, but which is the better bet now? Let’s break down their fundamentals, valuation, growth outlook and looming risks to find out which one is a better investment option today.NVDA: The AI Chip Giant With DominanceNVIDIA is an undisputed leader in AI chips, data centers, gaming and autonomous vehicles. Its products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. Revenues from this end-market surged 93% year over year to $35.58 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.NVIDIA’s latest earnings call underscored the company’s continued AI dominance. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the increasing demand for next-generation AI models that require unprecedented computational power. The company’s Blackwell architecture, capable of delivering up to 25 times the token throughput of its predecessor, is expected to drive the next wave of AI adoption.Further bolstering its leadership, NVIDIA is set to launch its Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platforms, which could solidify its position as the go-to AI infrastructure provider. With governments, corporations and cloud providers ramping up AI investments, NVIDIA remains the key beneficiary of this seismic shift in computing.However, the recent restrictions imposed by the Trump administration on exporting H20 chips to China are likely to hurt NVIDIA’s overall financial growth in the near term. The company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently stated that export restrictions on H20 chips have cost the company $15 billion in sales and expects approximately $5.5 billion in charges due to the ban in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.Despite the headwinds, NVIDIA is anticipated to remain on a high-growth trajectory. The company expects revenues of $43 billion (+/-2%) in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, indicating a year-over-year growth of more than 65%.SMCI: A High-Risk, High-Reward AI Infrastructure PlaySuper Micro Computer’s growth is driven by the need for AI workloads. As a growing number of data centers are proliferating and existing ones are expanding their capacity, the need for SMCI’s high-performance and energy-efficient servers is rising.Super Micro Computer’s liquid-cooled and modular servers are a hit among cloud service providers, government customers and enterprises as these servers possess the capacity to handle AI at scale. SMCI has further strengthened its AI expertise by collaborating with NVIDIA and integrating its Blackwell GPUs for high compute power.Despite the massive potential of Super Micro Computer’s server offerings, the company is facing some near-term challenges, including delayed purchasing decisions from customers as they are evaluating the adoption of next-generation AI platforms. SMCI is also facing margin contraction due to the growing price competition and price adjustments as companies are second-guessing their shift from older to newer platforms like Blackwell.In the last reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Super Micro Computer also incurred a one-time inventory write-down on older-generation GPUs and related components, further affecting its margins. Based on all the above factors, SMCI revised the revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 from the $23.5-$25.0 billion range to a range of $21.8 billion-$22.6 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: NVDA Stays Less Volatile Than SMCIThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Super Micro Computer’s fiscal 2025 EPS indicates a year-over-year decline of 6%, while that for fiscal 2026 signifies growth of 36%. The earnings estimate revision trend for the two fiscals has remained highly volatile over the last 60 days.SMCI Earnings Estimate Revision TrendThe consensus mark for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 EPS indicates year-over-year growth of 43% and 27%, respectively. Also, the earnings estimate revision trend for the stock has remained more stable compared with a highly volatile trend for SMCI. This stability is a testament to NVDA’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.NVDA Earnings Estimate Revision TrendNVDA vs. SMCI: Price Performance & Valuation CheckBoth companies have seen share price fluctuations over the past year amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While NVDA shares have soared 42.8% over the past year, SMCI dropped 50.6%.Valuation-wise, both NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer are trading at earnings multiples below their respective industry averages. However, NVDA’s current price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29.25X is significantly lower than the one-year median of 37.28X. On the other hand, SMCI’s P/E multiple of 16.41X is slightly higher than the one-year median of 16.10X.While SMCI appears cheaper on a P/E basis, it comes with significantly more volatility and execution risk.Conclusion: NVIDIA is the Better AI Hardware Bet Right NowWhile both NVIDIA and Super Micro Computer are important players in the AI revolution, NVIDIA clearly stands out as the stronger investment today.NVIDIA’s dominant market position, product innovation and earnings consistency make it the AI infrastructure stock of choice. Despite geopolitical challenges, the company is still expected to deliver blockbuster growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond, driven by its next-generation Blackwell architecture and robust customer demand.Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer is more of a high-risk, high-reward satellite play. It remains a compelling company with niche strengths, but its exposure to product cycles, customer hesitation and margin pressure makes its near-term outlook more uncertain.Furthermore, NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, making the stock a stronger pick compared with SMCI, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:16898bb2a094b:0-nvidia-vs-super-micro-which-ai-hardware-stock-should-you-bet-on/

The AI Diffusion Rule is Over. What That Means for Trump and China. — Barrons.com,1747747020000,"By Justin ShermanAbout the author: Justin Sherman is the founder and CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, a research and advisory firm, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.In a major trade and security pivot, President Donald Trump has scrapped his predecessor's so-called artificial intelligence diffusion rule that was set to be implemented last week. That rule, signed by President Joe Biden in his final days in office, added export controls on integrated circuits and AI models to countries such as China and Iran — with big exemptions for friendly nations such as Germany. Some U.S. AI and chip companies are cheering on this reversal, their present view reflecting that of a Commerce Department spokesperson: Biden's AI rule was ""overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation.""At face value, it seems the leading industry players and the U.S. government are on the same page: Companies want to build and sell chips and AI products globally, and the administration wants U.S. industry to boom. Both worry about Beijing's AI capabilities and threats to U.S. national security. Same talk, same page.But many chip and AI companies' talk about national security and China is more or less just that — talk. For some firms, talking about China and national security is simply a way to frame their own priorities, such as relaxing export controls or building data centers, in terms that land well with the current top policymakers. It seems like talking about Biden's diffusion rule as overly burdensome for companies — and therefore bad for national security — worked.When the rubber meets the road, however, AI and chip companies may not like the Trump administration's hawkish position on China, and the administration may not like companies' true views on national security issues. Whatever replaces the AI diffusion rule will expose those critical tensions.These commercial AI and national security concerns have been brewing under the surface for months. In 2024, many AI companies were trying to present themselves as moving in lockstep with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China. But the Biden administration's domestic work on trustworthy AI certainly caused friction with industry — particularly for those who would rather do away with safeguards. And some began whittling away at the national security narrative.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in July 2024 that closing off U.S. AI systems to China would be a mistake, as America's advantage comes from openness and fewer controls. Framed in the context of helping national security, the anti-regulatory argument spoke to a bigger policy concern: China. OpenAI, shortly thereafter, pitched the administration on a massive data center buildout, likewise framed as key to geopolitical competition. This kind of rhetoric, speaking to fears of ""falling behind"" in what many reductively call the ""AI race,"" also found a receptive audience in Washington. Biden started to put his executive order on data centers in motion.The apparent alignment between the government and commercial chip and AI firms changed with the flick of a pen. When the Biden team published the AI diffusion rule on Jan. 13, the backlash was swift from companies that were, a moment ago, speaking as if they backed the president's national security rationale.Nvidia released a statement that day calling the rule a misguided, unprecedented effort that ""threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide"" and ""squander America's hard-won technological advantage."" The rule is ""cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, "" but ""would do nothing to enhance U.S. security.""That rhetoric evidently worked on the new administration — and the benefits shortly flowed to investors. The day after Trump nixed the diffusion rule, Nvidia's stock rose 4.4%. AMD's stock rose 3.4%. But ditching Biden's order is a temporary resolve between these commercial and national security tensions, likely to be disrupted when the Trump administration rolls out the rule's replacement.A replacement program could relax chip and AI model technology exports to some countries favored by Trump, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and hugely ramp up limits for China. That will prompt industry concerns for chip companies wanting to sell in China and to maintain certain China-based supply chain points. Or a new program could soften restrictions below a certain compute or model performance threshold, but broadly curb exports of higher-end technologies in ways that impact a different vertical of industry sales.As a general rule, export restrictions focused on national security are going to both limit companies' overseas market opportunities and speak to issues that aren't companies' bread and butter. Just as some investment firms are skeptical of inbound and outbound investment screening, some leading chip and AI companies are unlikely to truly buy into the scope and degree of national security concerns about exports to China.So administration officials — particularly those most hawkish on Beijing — may find themselves in direct confrontation with chip and AI companies that are keen on continuing to sell high-end chips to Chinese buyers. The administration's concerns about AI diffusion to China through third countries may also conflict with companies that feel even countries with close ties to China aren't in fact China — and therefore aren't a risk. Officials could even encounter the same amount of pushback and criticism on a more relaxed export rule than the Biden administration faced on its more sweeping one. After all, the psychological treadmill kicks in, and even a more moderate set of rules will still raise the regulatory floor — and demand higher compliance costs and impact bottom lines.This isn't to say every chip and AI company is crying ""national security"" just to get on policymakers' calendars. Plenty of chip and AI companies build tech entirely or primarily for national security use cases. Some major AI vendors, such as Anthropic, supported the AI diffusion rule with tweaks. Last month, Anthropic said stronger export controls on chips were necessary to keep a competitive lead over China.It is healthy for commercial enterprises to have a range of views on geopolitical and national security issues, especially in a volatile global trade and geopolitical environment.But as the administration talks genuinely about the country's AI advantage over China, these tensions under the surface will bubble up again. Companies will have to navigate more uncertainty and new national security guidelines. And policymakers may have to confront public-private differences of opinion on China head-on.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Analog Devices Set to Report Q2 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,1747744560000,"Analog Devices, Inc. ADI is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22.Analog Devices expects revenues of $2.50 billion (+/- $100 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.50 billion, indicating an increase of 15.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.ADI anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $1.68 (+/-10 cents). The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $1.69 per share, indicating a 20.7% rise from the prior-year quarter’s figure.

Price and EPS Surprise Analog Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Analog Devices, Inc. QuoteFactors to Consider for ADI’s Q2 ResultsAnalog Devices’ second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from inventory normalization across both direct and distribution channels. Furthermore, the combination of improved bookings and lean inventory levels, following the end of the semiconductor industry's cyclical downturn, is expected to have supported top-line growth for ADI in the quarter to be reported.Since ADI is highly exposed to the Chinese market, the recent U.S. policies of tariff reduction on the Chinese market are likely to have given a boost to its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Analog Devices’ strong design wins in industrial automation, healthcare, automotive, and communications are expected to have boosted its second-quarter fiscal 2025 performance.Secular growth trends across industrial automation, healthcare and surgical robotics, automotive sector, AI infrastructure and high-end consumer devices are likely to have driven ADI’s top line in the fiscal second quarter. However, macroeconomic challenges, including the protracted inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates, are likely to have posed challenges for the company in the to-be-reported quarter.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: NVIDIA, Taiwan Semiconductor, Oracle and CoreWeave",1747744260000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights NVIDIA NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Oracle ORCL and CoreWeave CRWV.NVIDIA ""AI Factories"": More Than Just Clever Marketing?NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor , Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA's Santa Clara office ""launching"" into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA's growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA's ecosystem partners and described the industry's opportunity as ""extraordinary"" and ""once in a lifetime.""""We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,"" he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his ""AI Factory"" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about ""AI Factories"" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: ""massively parallel architectures.""I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled ""Get Your MPA in Deep Learning."" Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or ""in parallel,"" without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the ""MPAs"" faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these ""intelligence"" possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle CEO Larry Ellison mused last year ""We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more.""The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen's long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse ""digital twins"" to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between ""agentic AI"" and ""physical AI"" is mind-blowing. Agents are ""essentially digital robots,"" Huang said, able to ""perceive, understand and plan."" To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world's most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night...""AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,"" Huang said. ""These factories are essentially what we build today.""""They're not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.""I admit, ""tokens"" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink ""spine"" and said ""This moves more traffic than the entire Internet.""NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave , Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he's not talking about Bitcoin.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia's Jensen Huang Is Now a Geopolitical Superstar. It Comes With Risks. — WSJ,1747743420000,"By Liza Lin and Raffaele HuangTAIPEI — The American president called him ""my friend,"" Saudi Arabia bought hundreds of thousands of his chips and, in the land of his birth, he was hailed as ""the leader of team Taiwan.""With a visit to Taipei this week, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang capped a whirlwind month of travel that marked him as not just a business tycoon, but one of the world's most powerful geopolitical forces.Everyone wants a piece of the charismatic CEO and his coveted chips, seen as the gold standard for advanced artificial-intelligence computing. Investors celebrated his global coming-out party by pushing Nvidia shares up 40% over the past month. The stock's swoon in January is a distant memory and the company, with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, is again within striking distance of global No. 1.But international fame carries risks too — Huang does business in sensitive regions such as China and the Persian Gulf states.""His fortune and misfortune is that he created the most valuable technological input of the decade,"" said Barath Harithas, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The danger is that his visibility becomes a liability. He could end up the fall guy if things unravel in the Gulf, and then face political heat for any perceived overreach in China.""Huang's processors and investment spending have the power to change countries' fates, and the 62-year-old billionaire has himself been changed by his power. He has donned a business suit and tie for meetings with world leaders, shedding his customary leather jacket, and added praise for politicians to his salesman's patter about tokens and terabytes.""Without the president's leadership, his policies, his support and, very importantly, his strong encouragement,"" Huang said while standing beside President Trump at the White House on April 30, ""frankly, manufacturing in the United States wouldn't have accelerated to this pace.""Trump returned the favor two weeks later by giving a shout out to the CEO in a speech in Saudi Arabia. ""I see my friend is here, Jensen, that's very good,"" Trump said. ""He's putting in $500 billion,"" the president went on, referring to Nvidia's commitment to build AI supercomputers in the U.S.Since mid-April, Huang has been flying across the world, unveiling new investments and striking deals. In the Middle East last week, Huang met Saudi Arabia's crown prince and agreed to sell Nvidia's powerful AI processors to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.In Taiwan this week, the location of Nvidia's most important suppliers, Huang drew loud cheers and praise from the island's president when he announced on Monday the construction of a new Nvidia office building and plans for Taiwan's first AI supercomputer.Crowds and rock star-like excitement followed his every step. Huang, a U.S. citizen, was born on the island before moving to the U.S. as a child.When Huang was due to turn up at an Nvidia partner's booth at an industry conference on Tuesday, hordes of fans started to gather at the venue as early as an hour ahead. As he walked toward the booth, fans began pressing against the barricades, calling out ""Jensen, I love you!"" and reaching out to touch the executive.In a speech, Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn, called Huang ""the leader of team Taiwan"" for his efforts to build up Taiwan's AI industry.In return, Huang called Taiwan the ""epicenter of the world's computing industry.""Huang has pulled off the feat of staying friends with both the U.S. and China, despite tensions between the two superpowers.In early April, he attended a $1 million-a-head dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and afterward some inside Nvidia were confident the company could keep selling its H20 chips in China, which had been tailored to comply with earlier U.S. regulations. Instead, the U.S. said a few days later it would restrict the sale of the H20 chips, which led Nvidia to take a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter.Within days of the new rule, Huang flew to Beijing and publicly reassured senior Chinese officials the company would ""unwaveringly serve"" the market there. Later, he met the mayor of Shanghai and left with the city's blessing to open a new research and development center there.Huang has repeatedly said China will be a powerhouse in global AI development and it would be folly for Nvidia to neglect the market. Each time new U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors have been introduced, Nvidia has adapted by downgrading its chips' specs to continue selling to Chinese customers.Lian Jye Su, an analyst at Omdia covering AI, said Nvidia was trying to avoid picking sides between the U.S. and China.""Nvidia doesn't have the luxury of staying neutral, and can only try its best to minimize the political fallout,"" Su added.Last week, the Commerce Department put out guidance against the use of American AI chips to train Chinese models and warned against the diversion of such silicon to China.Harithas of CSIS said the perception of an American executive courting China ran against sentiment in Washington. ""If he leans too far toward China with even a neutered chip variant, he risks crossing a red line, triggering public rebuke, or worse, legal blowback,"" he said.Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com and Raffaele Huang at raffaele.huang@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250520004513:0/
"Nvidia to launch cheaper Blackwell AI chip for China after US export curbs, sources say",1748088000000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA will launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20 model and plans to start mass production as early as June, sources familiar with the matter said.The GPU or graphics processing unit will be part of Nvidia's latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors and is expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well below the $10,000-$12,000 the H20 sold for, according to two of the sources.The lower price reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements.It will be based on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a server-class graphics processor and will use conventional GDDR7 memory instead of more advanced high bandwidth memory, the two sources said.They added it would not use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's TWSE:2330 advanced Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology.The new chip's price, specifications and production timing have not previously been reported. The three sources Reuters spoke to for this article declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company was still evaluating its ""limited"" options. ""Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market."" TSMC declined to comment.MARKET SHARE PLUNGE China remains a huge market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the past financial year. It's the third time that Nvidia has had to tailor a GPU for the world's second-largest economy after restrictions from U.S. authorities who are keen to stymie Chinese technological development.After the U.S. effectively banned the H20 in April, Nvidia initially considered developing a downgraded version of the H20 for China, sources have said, but that plan didn't work out.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said last week the company's older Hopper architecture - which the H20 uses - can no longer accommodate further modifications under current U.S. export restrictions.Reuters was unable to determine the product's final name.Chinese brokerage GF Securities said in a note published on Tuesday that the new GPU would likely be called the 6000D or the B40, though it did not disclose pricing or cite sources for the information.According to two of the sources, Nvidia is also developing another Blackwell-architecture chip for China that is set to begin production as early as September. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm specifications of that variant.Nvidia's market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when U.S. export curbs that impacted its products began, to 50% currently, Huang told reporters in Taipei this week. Its main competitor is Huawei (HWT.UL) which produces the Ascend 910B chip.Huang also warned that if U.S. export curbs continue, more Chinese customers will buy Huawei's chips.The H20 ban forced Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory and Huang told the Stratechery podcast on Monday that the company also had to walk away from $15 billion in sales.The latest export restrictions introduced new limits on GPU memory bandwidth - a crucial metric measuring data transmission speeds between the main processor and memory chips. This capability is particularly important for AI workloads that require extensive data processing.Investment bank Jefferies estimates that the new regulations cap memory bandwidth at 1.7-1.8 terabytes per second. That compares with the 4 terabytes per second that the H20 is capable of.GF Securities forecast the new GPU will achieve approximately 1.7 terabytes per second using GDDR7 memory technology, just within the export control limits.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU045:0-nvidia-to-launch-cheaper-blackwell-ai-chip-for-china-after-us-export-curbs-sources-say/"

"High-Yield ETFs: Big Payouts, Bigger Trade-Offs?",1747743240000,"While a significant amount of money continues to flow into low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs, the ETF universe is becoming increasingly complex. Most new ETFs being launched are actively managed, and many make use of derivatives.Two recent regulatory changes—the “ETF Rule” and the “Derivatives Rule”—have made it easier for providers to launch ETFs and incorporate derivatives into their strategies. The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking.Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:Buffer or defined outcome ETFsLeveraged or inverse single-stock ETFsOption-based income ETFsSome of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs. (See: Buffer ETFs Attract Billions as Investors Seek Shelter from Market Turmoil)This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts.We analyzed the performance of 24 single-stock covered call ETFs in the YieldMax suite from their respective inception dates. We focused on YieldMax because it is the clear leader in this niche, significantly ahead of competitors despite a recent surge in similar offerings.Many of YieldMax’s ETFs launched in 2023—providing a limited, yet more substantial, performance history compared to most rivals, which are even newer.Despite their eye-popping distribution rates, these products tend to underperform on a total return basis due to steep declines in share price. Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, only two managed to slightly outperform their respective underlying stocks.Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy WorksYieldMax currently offers 48 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of over $10 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market.According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap.These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income.To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spread strategies to further enhance yields.The YieldMax Reddit community has around 44,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income.The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums—and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM.Yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly payout and dividing it by the fund’s latest NAV. However, yields can vary significantly from month to month as income from selling options depends on fluctuations in the underlying stock, implied volatility, and other factors.Performance Since InceptionWe analyzed the total return—including distributions—of 24 YieldMax single-stock ETFs from their inception versus their respective underlying stocks. Some stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat—but in all cases except those tracking PayPal PYPL and Marathon Digital MARA, the ETF underperformed the stock.For the four most popular products, the performance gap was substantial—showing that investors may be leaving a lot of money on the table in pursuit of yield.YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY )The most popular product in the suite celebrated its one-year anniversary in February and now boasts $4 billion in assets. It is also the highest-yielding single-stock ETF in the lineup, offering a distribution rate of 136%. Since inception, it has delivered a total return of 286%, while MSTR stock has surged 457% during the same period.Once a little-known, money-losing software firm, Strategy MSTR has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and now trades like a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. Its stock commands a significant premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings.Some experts believe the financial engineering behind MSTY—and the premium valuation—may be unsustainable. If you're bullish on bitcoin, why not consider the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which charges just 0.25% and closely tracks the price of the asset?TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY)The oldest product in the suite holds $1.2 billion in assets. Since its debut in November 2022, the ETF has gained approximately 22%—significantly underperforming Tesla TSLA shares, which are up about 102% over the same period. It has also lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, which have gained 53% and 85%, respectively.For context, low-cost index funds like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM charge just 0.02% and 0.15% in fees, while most option income products charge close to 1%. TSLY currently boasts a striking yield of nearly 107%.NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY )The second most popular product in the family has generated a total return of about 187% since its inception in May 2023. However, shares of the AI darling NVIDIA NVDA have risen approximately 372% over the same period. Still, the ETF has attracted $1.3 billion in assets.YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY )CONY, which tracks Coinbase COIN—a major beneficiary of bitcoin’s rise—has returned 120% since its debut in August 2023. Over the same period, COIN stock has gained about 209%. The ETF currently sports a yield of 97% and has about $1.1 billion in assets.Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFsThese ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price. In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if the stock falls—creating an asymmetric risk-reward profile.By contrast, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI—which helped launch the covered call trend—uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of about 125 stocks. (Read: What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?)The fund then sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate monthly income. This portfolio doesn’t experience the outsized moves seen in names like Strategy or Coinbase, which explains why the performance shortfall may not be too striking.Bottom LineYou should only invest in a fund tied to a single stock if you're bullish on that specific name—in which case, you're generally better off owning the stock directly. If you expect the stock to decline, it’s best to steer clear of any product linked to it.These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound. However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don’t expect jumbo distributions.If you’re drawn to high monthly income and can accept an asymmetric risk-reward profile—as well as potentially unfavorable and inconsistent tax treatment—these funds may still appeal to you.ETFs have democratized access to markets, and innovation in the space has been remarkable. But with complex products like these, it’s essential for investors to fully understand how they work—and what outcomes are realistic.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ab88debad094b:0-high-yield-etfs-big-payouts-bigger-trade-offs/
Nvidia CEO calls Trump re-industrialisation policies 'visionary',1748085487000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden.Nvidia will provide its latest generation AI data centre platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson OMXSTO:ERIC_A and drug developer AstraZeneca LSE:AZN . Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by previous President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips. Huang, who had earlier called controls ""a failure,"" said President Donald Trump wanted U.S. firms to ""win"".""American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown,"" he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University. ""The President would like American technology to win with Nvidia and American companies to sell chips all over the world and to generate revenues, tax revenues, invest and build in the United States,"" he said. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues. Many businesses and economists, though, have warned tariffs could have the opposite effect and lead to a recession in the United States and a global downturn by pushing up costs, upending supply chains and hurting consumer and business confidence.Huang said many policies related to re-industrialisation were ""very visionary"". ""Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain - all of that is excellent,"" he said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L5N3RW01A:0-nvidia-ceo-calls-trump-re-industrialisation-policies-visionary/"

Cadence Rises 27% in a Month: How Should You Play the Stock?,1747740720000,"Cadence Design Systems CDNS stock surged 27.3% in the past month, outperforming the Computer-Software industry, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite’s growth of 25.3%, 22.6% and 15.3%, respectively.Price PerformanceThe trigger has been the company’s stellar first-quarter results, with the stock gaining 12% since April 28. The stock closed last trading session at $320.30 and is now much closer to its 52-week high of $328.99. So, the question now arises is whether to stay invested or pull out? Can the stock rally further? Let us analyze the stock in detail to ascertain if it is worth investment consideration.CDNS Boasts Strong FundamentalsBroad-based demand for its solutions amid robust design activity is a key catalyst. Secular trends like 5G, increasing usage of hyperscale computing and autonomous driving are influencing design activity across semiconductor and systems companies. This is likely to open up opportunities for its end-to-end EDA, IP and systems solutions. The focus on Generative AI, Agentic AI and Physical AI is leading to an exponential increase in computing demand and semiconductor innovation. This bodes well for Cadence.To capitalize on this opportunity, it has been collaborating with several tech giants, including Qualcomm and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, on their next-generation AI designs across both training and inference. The company also expanded its partnership with NVIDIA for the latter’s Grace Blackwell architecture to accelerate computing and agentic AI solutions. It is among the first adopters of the NVIDIA Omniverse blueprint for AI-factory digital twins, which will augment data center design and operations. Cadence is eyeing new AI markets like Life Sciences through its OpenEye drug discovery software. The company is also expanding partnerships with its foundry partners like Taiwian Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel and Arm Holdings.Amid rapid AI proliferation, the Cadence.ai portfolio has been gaining momentum along with AI-powered products such as Cadence Cerebrus. The product had more than 1000 tapeouts year to date and 50 new logos in the first quarter. Going ahead, the company is likely to benefit from customers increasing their R&D spending in AI-driven automation. On the last earnings call, Cadence highlighted that it has not seen any shifts in customers’ behavior presently, as they continue to invest in next-generation designs.Cadence continues to invest heavily in verification and digital design products, which is helping it to launch products that address the ever-growing needs of electronics and semiconductor companies. The company’s verification business has been gaining traction due to the rising complexity of system verification and software bring-up.In April 2024, the company unveiled the latest Palladium Z3 Emulation and Protium X3 FPGA Prototyping systems. This is an advanced digital twin platform that is aimed at addressing the growing complexity of system and semiconductor design. The latest systems offer more than double the capacity and a significant performance increase compared with Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 systems. In 2024, hardware solutions added more than 30 customers and almost 200 repeat customers, especially among AI and hyperscale clients.The strategic acquisition plan has played a pivotal part in developing the company’s business in the last few years. To strengthen its IP business, the company announced the acquisition of Secure-IC, which will expand its IP portfolio, including interface, memory, AI and DSP solutions. In April 2025, Cadence signed a definitive agreement with Arm Holdings to acquire its Artisan foundation IP business. The acquisition includes a suite of standard cell libraries, memory compilers and general-purpose I/Os, all finely tuned for advanced process nodes at leading global foundries.CDNS’ Robust OutlookDriven by strong results, management upgraded its outlook for 2025. Revenues for 2025 are now estimated to be in the range of $5.15-$5.23 billion compared with $5.14-$5.22 billion guided earlier. Non-GAAP EPS for 2025 is expected to be between $6.73 and $6.83 compared with $6.65-$6.75 guided earlier.Challenges Loom Ahead for CDNSWeakness prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions and substantial exposure to the semiconductor vertical are concerning. Any reduction in R&D spending for companies within the semiconductor sector could affect CDNS' top-line performance.Higher operating costs and stiff competition in the EDA/AI space from the likes of Keysight Technologies, Synopsys SNPS and ANSYS ANSS are additional headwinds. The pending acquisition of ANSYS by Synopsys is likely to intensify competition in the EDA space for all players. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025.While Cadence is expanding aggressively through M&A, acquisitions may distract from core performance if integration falls short or synergies do not materialize as expected, which could weigh on margins.CDNS' Premium Valuation & Estimate RevisionCadence stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 45.04X compared with the industry’s 32.02X. In comparison, SNPS and ANSS trade at multiples of 32.16 and 28.01, respectively.Analysts remain bearish on the stock, as evident from the downward estimate revision in the past 60 days.Conclusion: Hold CDNS Despite HeadwindsCadence, with its strong fundamentals, robust AI-driven demand and a resilient recurring revenue model, remains a compelling opportunity. The company’s prominent position in the EDA space and strategic partnerships with tech giants like NVIDIA and Qualcomm position it well for long-term growth. While macro uncertainty, integration risks and valuation are valid concerns, the company's upgraded guidance and expanding market footprint support a continued bullish outlook. Given the strong momentum and secular tailwinds, holding the stock remains a prudent strategy for long-term investors.CDNS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see t he complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

How CoreWeave Stock Became a $2 Billion Win for Nvidia — Barron's,1748050200000,"Ed LinNvidia may be best known for artificial-intelligence chips, but the company hasn't been a slouch in some of its investing activity. An early stake in a hot stock has paid off enormously.In April 2023, Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, long before that cloud provider's initial public offering this March. The 17.9 million preferred CoreWeave shares Nvidia purchased, at $5.58 each, were converted into an equivalent amount of common shares with the IPO. Nvidia invested another $250 million in CoreWeave's IPO, paying $40 a share for 6.25 million more shares.All told, as of the end of March, Nvidia owned 24.2 million CoreWeave shares, a 7% stake, according to a form Nvidia filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using a recent trading price of $83.42 — already more than double the $40 IPO price — that stake is valued at $2.02 billion, a paper profit of $1.67 billion on the $350 million Nvidia paid.Nvidia declined to comment. It referred Barron's to CoreWeave's regulatory filings.CoreWeave is a pure play on AI. All of its revenue comes from cloud-based rentals of AI servers that use Nvidia chips.In April 2023, the same month Nvidia invested $100 million in CoreWeave, the two companies reached a master services agreement for CoreWeave to provide Nvidia with infrastructure and platform services. Through the end of 2024, Nvidia had paid CoreWeave about $320 million under the pact.Inside Scoop is a regular Barron's feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members — so-called insiders — as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/

The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $551.7 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 67.7%.NVIDIA Stock Price Performance & ValuationShares of NVIDIA have remained highly volatile over the past year. NVDA stock has gained 27% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s growth of 23.5%. The stock has also outperformed major semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology have lost 30.1%, 24% and 19.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value NVIDIA offers investors at the current levels. NVIDIA is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 15.48X compared with the industry’s 13.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.NVDA also trades at a premium compared with other semiconductor players, including Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology. Currently, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology trade at a forward P/S multiples of 5.37X, 2.48X and 5.94X, respectively.Investment Consideration for NVIDIAOver the past year, NVIDIA’s revenue growth has been driven by robust demand for chips required for the development of generative AI models. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven useful across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.However, the complexity of generative AI, which requires vast knowledge and immense computational power, means that enterprises will need to significantly upgrade their network infrastructures. NVIDIA’s AI chips, including the A100, H100 and B100, are the top choices for building and running these powerful AI applications, positioning the company as a leader in this space. As the generative AI revolution unfolds, we expect NVIDIA's advanced chips to drive substantial growth in both its revenues and market presence.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles. The company's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity.However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility.

Arbe Announces Q1 2025 Financial Results,1747738800000,"TEL AVIV, Israel, May 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Arbe Robotics Ltd. NASDAQ:ARBE TASE:ARBE (""Arbe""), a global leader in perception radar solutions, today announced financial results for its first quarter, which ended March 31, 2025.Scaling Up Toward High-Volume Production:- Arbe made significant progress toward design wins with leading European OEMs, securing orders for radar systems to support advanced data collection programs. The OEMs' data collection program is one of the final steps in the automotive sourcing process. The company expects that its radar technology will serve as a key enabler for high volume 2028 passenger vehicle platforms, with revenue projected to begin in 2027. Arbe's strong financial position is expected to support the program's execution.- In April, HiRain Technologies, Arbe's Tier 1 in China, launched a production-intent long-range imaging radar system, the LRR615, powered by Arbe's high-performance chipset. Engineered for ultra-high resolution and reliable performance in all weather and lighting conditions, the LRR615 is tailored for the Chinese autonomous driving market and marks a pivotal step toward industrial-scale deployment.- Sensrad, Arbe's Tier 1 for non-automotive sectors, placed an order for over a thousand imaging radar chips to serve multiple customers across a range of applications, underscoring both confidence in the platform and growing commercial traction. These developments reflect tangible progress toward an expected launch of the Sensrad radar system later this year.Expanding Strategic Collaboration:- Arbe launched a collaboration with NVIDIA to enhance radar-based free space mapping and AI-driven capabilities. Arbe's high-resolution radar integration with the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX in-vehicle computing platform was showcased at CES 2025.Capital Raise:- In January 2025, Arbe successfully raised $33 million through an underwritten registered direct offering, which included the exercise of a $4 million over-allotment option by the underwriters, led by Canaccord Genuity. In addition, in January 2025, $21.5 million was released to the company from the escrow account, following the conversion of convertible bonds issued on the TASE in 2024.Management Comments""We're excited by the progress we've made this quarter as we scale toward high-volume production,"" said Kobi Marenko, Chief Executive Officer. ""We secured radar systems orders for data collection from leading European OEMs, marking a key step toward a design win and reinforcing our position on the path to OEM selection. In parallel, the launch of HiRain's LRR615 system, successfully industrialized using our chipset, demonstrates our Tier 1s' ability to bring Arbe-powered products to market. Sensrad's growing demand across non-automotive applications, evidenced by chipset orders, further expands our market reach and signals their readiness for mass production.""These milestones highlight the depth of our technology, the strength of our partnerships, and the maturity of our execution. Backed by a solid balance sheet, we are well-positioned to lead the transition to ultra-high-resolution radar across both automotive and non-automotive markets.""First Quarter 2025 Financial Results HighlightsRevenues for Q1 2025 were $0.04 million, compared to $0.1 million in Q1 2024. Backlog as of March 31, 2025 amounted to $0.25 million.Gross profit for Q1 2025 was negative ($0.3) million, consistent with the negative gross profit of ($0.3) million in Q1 2024.Operating expenses in Q1 2025 were $13.1 million, compared to $12.5 million in Q1 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a one-time expense related to our continued efforts to finalize chip design toward production, most notably tape-outs. A decrease in non-cash share-based compensation expenses, related to vesting period finalization was offset by year over year provision adjustments.As a result, our operating loss in Q1 2025 was $13.4 million, compared to a $12.8 million loss in Q1 2024.Net loss in Q1 2025 was $13.8 million, compared to a net loss of $12.8 million in Q1 2024. Net loss in Q1 2025 included $0.5 million in financial expenses, compared to $0.05 million in Q1 2024. Financial expenses in Q1 2025 included expenses related to bond conversion and derivative liabilities partially offset by interest from deposits and warrants revaluations. Financial expenses in Q1 2024 included exchange rate revaluation expenses offset by interest from deposits and warrants revaluations.Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement which excludes expenses for non-cash share-based compensation and for non-recurring items, for Q1 2025, yielded a loss of $9.7 million, compared with a loss of $8.5 million in Q1 2024. We believe that this non-GAAP measurement is important in management's evaluation of our use of cash and in planning and evaluating our cash requirements for the coming period.Balance Sheet and Liquidity HighlightsAs of March 31, 2025, Arbe had $36.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short- term bank deposits, and $35.2 million in long-term bank deposits.OutlookArbe's leading radar technology remains a top priority for key decision-makers in the automotive industry. Recent cash infusions totaling nearly $70 million further underscore investor confidence in Arbe's market potential and growth trajectory.- While broader economic shifts have led to short-term delays in automakers' roll-out of advanced driver assistance systems, decision timelines have been extended. As a result, Arbe continues to engage closely with industry leaders, advancing through RFQ stages and reinforced its position for adoption. We continue with our goal to pursue four design-ins with automakers in 2025.- 2025 Annual revenues are expected to be in the range of $2 to $5 million and will be weighted towards the end of the year.- We significantly strengthened our balance sheet, and our adjusted EBITDA for 2025 is projected to be in the range of ($29 million) and ($35 million).Conference Call & Webcast DetailsArbe will host a conference call and webcast today, May 20, 2025, at 8:30 am ET.

Income Investing: Options Can Be a Source Of Cash — or Information — Barron's,1748050200000,"They can be a source of cash or a source of information. By Al RootIncome investors usually want to keep it simple, and stock options are anything but. They can still be a useful tool, however, especially when pondering the safety of a dividend.That's not the first thing that people typically think of when they contemplate stock options. Though they're often viewed as synonymous with speculation, they can also hedge positions, provide portfolio income, and gauge the potential size of stock moves around significant events such as earnings.Options, as their name suggests, give the holder the ""option"" to buy or sell a stock at a fixed price in the future. Call options give the right to buy a stock, while put options grant the right to sell. How does that work? Let's say investors think Nvidia stock will go up. They could buy shares for a recent $132, and wait. If the stock trades to $240, they would make about 82%.But for $10, investors who believe that Nvidia stock is heading higher can purchase a call option on the stock that gives them the right to buy the shares for $200 each in about one year. If the stock trades up to $240 in a year, they would then execute the option, take ownership of the stock for $200, and then sell it for $240, giving them a gain of $30 — they paid $10 for the option — or 300% on their initial investment. Of course, an option can be an all-or-nothing bet. If Nvidia stock closes below $200 in a year, the $10 disappears.Investors don't need to buy and sell options for them to be useful. Options can also tell investors a lot about the safety of the dividends for the stocks they own, says Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics, a 27-year-old research firm. That's a valuable tool these days, considering the volatility induced by trade wars, geopolitics, and recession fears.The math to determine dividend direction can get complicated. Options prices reflect a lot of factors simultaneously, including a stock's expected volatility, the time to expiration, the level of interest rates, and, yes, dividend payments. Traders have to account for all of these when figuring out what to pay for an option, and if all other factors are controlled for, it's possible to see what traders are predicting for the dividend.They're not always right. After Covid-19 crushed markets in early 2020, options prices for Philip Morris International reflected a dividend cut. The cut never arrived. Instead, the company raised its dividend about 3% that year. More recently, markets took a dip around President Donald Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day,"" as investors worried that high tariff rates and an escalating trade war would create a Covid-like market crisis. The Cboe Volatility index — better known as the VIX — spiked from less than 20 shortly before the announcement to more than 50 in early April. Despite the volatility, options on Philip Morris, which yields 3.1%, never reflected a dividend cut after the tariff announcements, says DeSimone.Philip Morris is known for the safety of its dividend, but what about some others with high yields that appear increasingly uncertain? DeSimone looked at chemical makers Dow and LyondellBasell Industries, which yield 9.3% and 9%, respectively, and food company Kraft Heinz, which has a 5.7% payout, and found that the options market isn't implying a dividend cut in their futures. There's no guarantee that the companies won't cut their dividends. Dow and Lyondell have been suffering from depressed earnings and cash flow resulting from falling chemical prices amid weak global demand . Kraft, for its part, hasn't grown earnings for a decade and recently announced a strategic review to boost lagging performance.Those situations have made investors nervous. The options analysis, however, suggests that there's reason for optimism. For income investors, it's a place to start.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522002520:0/

Nvidia Stock Slips. What's Weighing on the Chip Maker's Shares. — Barrons.com,1747738380000,"By George Glover and Adam ClarkNvidia stock was edging lower early Tuesday as investors weighed up a number of developments that could impact the chip maker's bottom line.Shares slid 0.3% to $135.22 in premarket trading. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 were down 0.3%.There's been a flurry of news about Nvidia, the world's second-largest company by total market capitalization, this week.CEO Jensen Huang said Monday that the chip maker would be opening its artificial-intelligence server platform to rival chip makers, which could offer a new source of revenue.""By making its proprietary interconnect technology available to a much larger set of architectures and use-cases, Nvidia is likely cementing itself further inside of AI racks, even as we see a shift toward multivendor sourcing and greater variation in how these AI racks are built,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Neji in a research note.Neji has an Outperform rating on Nvidia stock with no price target.However, while Nvidia is expanding its market in one area, its sales to China are being restricted.Huang said that the U.S. government's move to limit sales of the company's H20 chip to Chinese customers would hit revenue by $15 billion, in an interview with tech newsletter Stratechery. That's a bigger loss than the $10 billion which had been estimated by analysts at Jefferies.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Jamie Dimon's Tariffs Warning Should Have Rocked Markets. Why He's Being Ignored. — Barrons.com,1747738080000,"Not much seems to be making a dent in the current market optimism. The latest warnings from JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon on geopolitical risks and tariffs have become par for the course.While he hasn't quite achieved the stature of legendary investor Warren Buffett, as the head of America's biggest bank people usually sit up and listen when Dimon makes predictions.To be sure, he's not always right. He foresaw an economic collapse when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates after the Covid-19 pandemic, and he has been saying for years that the collapse of Bitcoin is imminent.His comments on Monday weren't nearly as controversial. He said stocks could sell off, credit could become scarcer, geopolitical risks are high, the tariff rates that President Donald Trump has imposed are ""extreme,"" and there's a bigger chance of stagflation — the combination of weak growth and quickly rising prices — than people are counting on at the minute.That's sensible enough. But after months of peaks and troughs from tariff news, investors are basking in the relative calm. Stocks were even able to shrug off Moody's downgrade of U.S. government bonds to finish in the black yesterday.Also Dimon isn't worried about JPMorgan. The company stuck to its guidance at its investor day Monday and sees strong growth ahead, in spite of the risks that Dimon himself flagged.There will come a time when the warnings may need to be taken more seriously. Stagflation is miserable and tough to overcome — though if Home Depot's results on Tuesday are anything to go by, things aren't bad yet. The home improvement chain maintained guidance for the year even as it missed expectations for the quarter. Earnings from Target and TJX later in the week will add to the picture.Stagflation is also a tricky situation for the Fed. As interest-rate setters pointed out Monday, it creates a dilemma that could force the central bank to choose — at least in the short term — between the two mandates of keeping inflation low and maximizing employment.One thing Dimon shares with Buffett is that he's going to step down in the not-too-distant future. Investors may not have their sage advice much longer, even if they choose to ignore it now.- Brian Swint***Fed Officials Say Downgrade Complicates Inflation OutlookMoody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating could have implications for prices that Federal Reserve policymakers will need to monitor, according to Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. Concern about the U.S.'s financial strength could result in investors demanding higher yields to hold Treasury debt.- Moody's expects the federal deficit to reach nearly 9% of gross domestic product this year, from 6.4% in 2024. The downgrade raises questions about long-term U.S. spending and debt. That makes anything financed by the public and private sectors more expensive, said RSM US chief economist Joe Brusuelas. - The 10-year Treasury note yield is near 4.5%, about where it was a year ago. But if yields were to rise materially again, it could influence the Fed's thinking on interest rates. Bostic, who currently isn't a Fed voting member, told CNBC he is leaning toward one rate cut in 2025. - Based on April inflation data, the average effective tariff rate is now 16%, up from 3% in February, according to Sam Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows expectations for two quarter-point cuts this fall, down from the three cuts expected earlier this year. - Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson and Bostic spoke Monday of continuing uncertainty facing the U.S. economy. It is too early to tell how tariffs and other White House policies, as well as the administration's proposed tax changes, will affect the Fed's dual mandate, Bostic noted. What's Next: The Fed next meets June 17-18 and is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for a fourth straight meeting. Policymakers will also update their economic projections, offering fresh guidance on the likely path of inflation, employment, and interest rates.- Nicole Goodkind***Nvidia's CEO Says Ban of Its Chips to China Costs $15 BillionNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has put a number on the revenue impact of the U.S. government's latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion. He called the ban deeply painful, and said the restrictions are shortsighted and ultimately will only help China.- Last month, the Trump administration effectively banned sending Nvidia's H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter. - Critics have said offering Nvidia's AI chips to China -- even one or two generations old -- can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees, making his comments in an interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson. - The restrictions open the market in China for increased usage of Huawei's AI chips, Huang said in the interview. If more companies use Huawei's chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia's current CUDA software advantage could erode. - His comments coincide with Nvidia's announcement at a trade show in Taiwan that it is taking a significant step toward opening its platform and allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chips for use on equipment in Nvidia server racks. What's Next: The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's system when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology. For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its own server platform.- Tae Kim***At JPMorgan, CEO Dimon's Successor Still a MysteryJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon will mark 20 years in that job next year, and it's still not clear when he will step down from the helm except for his hints at Monday's investor meeting that ""nothing's changed"" from last year and ""it's up to the board."" Dimon turns 70 next year.- Wall Street has been awaiting clarity on his successor since he said last year it wouldn't take another five years. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's consumer banking head, is seen as the top contender. She appeared at investor day and said they had anticipated an economic soft landing ""until recently."" - Dimon's views are closely followed on Wall Street, where he serves as an elder statesman. He cautioned current geopolitical risk is ""very, very high,"" adding that the Trump administration's reduced tariff rates were still ""pretty extreme."" In his view, the chance of stagflation is ""a little bit higher"" than others think. - JPMorgan reaffirmed its full-year net interest income forecast of about $94.5 billion. Management said the company is well positioned to take advantage of a possibly improved regulatory environment and can navigate the current uncertainty that has weighed on the economy. - CFO Jeremy Barnum called JPMorgan one of the early movers in artificial intelligence, originally using it to prevent fraud, and now eyeing other uses for it, such as customer service functions. ""We can't afford to fall behind,"" he said. What's Next: Dimon also reiterated his still-lukewarm feelings about crypto. While he'd be open to JPMorgan offering Bitcoin to clients who want to buy it, he doesn't want the bank to custody it, and personally prefers to keep his distance.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Janet H. Cho***Regeneron Wants This DNA Testing Firm. The Question Is Why?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals entered into a head-scratching $256 million deal for most of the bankrupt consumer genetic-testing business known as 23andMe. What Regeneron seems to be aiming at is using 23andMe's data for drug development. That's what 23andMe planned to do itself as it went public in 2021.- 23andMe became famous for the home DNA tests consumers used to trace their ancestry. Regeneron plans to keep selling DNA tests to consumers. It's also buying the 23andMe ""Biobank,"" a database of genetic information from millions of customers who agreed to allow their genetic data to be used for research. - Once valued at more than $5 billion, 23andMe's business struggled. In bankruptcy filings this year, 23andMe said genetic-testing revenue and demand had declined, while competition had increased. After its bankruptcy in March, consumers raced to have their genetic information deleted from its database and genetic samples destroyed. - Regeneron's drug Eylea for wet age-related macular degeneration faces stiff competition, particularly from a new Amgen drug called Pavblu. Sales of a new dose of Eylea are lagging expectations, and analysts are watching as Regeneron defines its next chapter as Eylea and Dupixent near patent expiration. - The company's chief scientific officer, George Yancopoulos, said the 23andMe deal can help build upon its mission to help those interested in learning about their own DNA and how to improve their personal health, ""while furthering Regeneron's efforts to use large-scale genetics research to improve the way society treats and prevents illness overall."" What's Next: The bankruptcy court on June 17 is scheduled to review and potentially approve the transaction. Regeneron has assured 23andMe customers that it would comply with its consumer-privacy policies and protect its data with high standards for data privacy, security, and ethical oversight.- Josh Nathan-Kazis and Janet H. Cho*** UnitedHealth Insiders Buy Stock After SlumpThe raft of bad news weighing on UnitedHealth Group stock appeared to be a buying opportunity for a bunch of its directors. Five company insiders, including new CEO Stephen Hemsley, have bought stock, showing the embattled health insurer's execs are willing to ""put their money where their mouth is,"" according to one analyst.- Hemsley purchased about $25 million of UnitedHealth stock on Friday -- 86,700 shares at an average price of $288.57 -- according to a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday. CFO John Rex and three directors also bought shares. - UnitedHealth stock rose 8% Monday, beating every other stock in both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's still down 37% in 2025, making it the Dow's worst performer for the year. - UnitedHealth shares fell sharply last week after the company surprised Wall Street by pulling financial guidance for 2025 and bringing Hemsley back to the CEO role to replace Andrew Witty, who stepped down for ""personal reasons."" Hemsley had been CEO from 2006 to 2017. - Shares were also pressured by a report from The Wall Street Journal saying that the Justice Department is investigating the company for possible criminal Medicare fraud. UnitedHealth said in a statement that it hadn't been notified by the Justice Department of the criminal investigation and that it stands ""by the integrity of [its] Medicare Advantage program."" What's Next: The insider buys could be good news for the beaten-down stock, per Zacks Investment Research strategist Andrew Rocco. ""Heavy insider buying in a short period is one of the best 'tells' savvy investors can observe for a prospective stock. Last week, UNH insiders put their money where their mouth is,"" he said.- Andrew Bary***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert SteinerThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/

Platinum Gets a Glimmer of Hope. But Gold Still Rules. — Barrons.com,1748041860000,"By Andrew BaryPlatinum prices are starting to rise, and the rally could have legs. It has been a while since it was a precious-metal king. In May 2014, platinum traded for $1,500 an ounce, $200 more than gold. But since then, it has trailed gold. On Thursday, gold was at $3,323 an ounce, and platinum, $1,017.Platinum supply runs about seven million ounces annually from mining and recycling, compared with more than 100 million ounces of gold. Platinum has been in deficit for the past two years, meaning that demand has exceeded supply and the market has been drawing down aboveground stocks. The World Platinum Investment Council estimates that the deficit will continue in 2025.One reason: More than half of mined platinum comes from South Africa, where mines are often old, deep, and expensive to operate. The WPIC sees mined supply falling 6% this year to 5.4 million ounces. Unlike gold, platinum lacks central bank demand. Some 40% of demand comes from car catalytic converters, threatened by electric vehicles, which lack converters. But EV sales have stalled, and popular hybrids use converters.Meanwhile, Chinese buyers priced out of gold are turning to platinum. The largest platinum exchange-traded fund, Abrdn Physical Platinum Shares, hit a 52-week high this past week and is up 18% in 2025.

Nvidia Selects Navitas Semiconductor to Work on Next-Generation 800V HVDC Architecture,1747861260000,"By Connor HartNvidia will collaborate with Navitas Semiconductor on its next-generation 800V HVDC architecture.Terms of the collaboration, which sent Navitas's stock soaring in after-hours trading, weren't disclosed.Shares of Navitas surged 150%, to $4.81, after the closing bell. Through the regular session's close, shares of Navitas have lost about half their value in the past year.The architecture will support systems that power Nvidia's GPUs, aiming to establish efficient and scalable power for next-generation artificial-intelligence workloads, Navitas said Wednesday.The new device will additionally aim to improve reliability and reduce infrastructure complexity by directly converting grid power to 800V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers and industrial-grade rectifiers. The company said this conversion will eliminate several steps from the current process.As a result, Nvidia's 800V HVDC architecture is expected to improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% and lower cooling costs, according to Navitas.""With our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA's 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU,"" Navitas Chief Executive Gene Sheridan said.Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521010476:0-nvidia-selects-navitas-semiconductor-to-work-on-next-generation-800v-hvdc-architecture/

Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Nvidia (NVDA) Opens NVLink Fusion to Outside Chips in AI Push,1747692939000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) is loosening its grip. At Computex 2025, the chipmaker launched NVLink Fusion, a new effort to let outside CPUs and ASICs work with its GPUspart of a broader bid to remain indispensable in AI infrastructure, even when competitors build the rest.NVLink used to be Nvidia-only. Not anymore. Fusion cracks open the ecosystem, making room for third-party processors to plug into Nvidia's platform. Early partners include MediaTek, Marvell Technology (MRVL, Financials), Synopsys (SNPS, Financials), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS, Financials), and Alchip. Customers like Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials) now have more room to mix and match.That flexibility matters. Nvidia already dominates general-purpose AI chips, but rivals like Amazon and Google are pouring money into custom silicon. Analysts say Fusion helps Nvidia stay in the roomeven if it doesn't own all the furniture.There's a tradeoff. Fusion could reduce demand for Nvidia's own CPUs, but makes its GPUs harder to replace in hybrid systems.Broadcom (AVGO, Financials), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials), and Intel (INTC, Financials) are not part of this first wave.Nvidia also introduced DGX Cloud Lepton, a kind of GPU marketplace to help AI developers find cloud horsepower. And it teased the GB300, its next Grace Blackwell system, coming in Q3 2025.The company is also going bigger in Taiwan, opening a new office and working with Foxconn on a local AI supercomputer.If Fusion catches on, Nvidia could tighten its hold on the AI data centerone link at a time.- See insider trades for NVDA. - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e460af412094b:0-nvidia-nvda-opens-nvlink-fusion-to-outside-chips-in-ai-push/
NVIDIA Selects Navitas to Collaborate on Next Generation 800 V HVDC Architecture,1747858661000,"TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Navitas Semiconductor NASDAQ:NVTS , the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast™ gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC™ silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support ‘Kyber’ rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast™ and GeneSiC™ power technologies.NVIDIA’s next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity.Today’s existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency.Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia’s approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability.        Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand.The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra.Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. The high-power GaNSafe™ power ICs integrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world’s safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCC pin.Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V.Enabled by 20 years of SiC innovation leadership, GeneSiC proprietary ‘trench-assisted planar’ technology provides world-leading performance over temperature, delivering high-speed, cool-running operation for high-power, high-reliability applications. G3F SiC MOSFETs deliver high-efficiency with high-speed performance, enabling up to 25°C lower case temperature, and up to 3x longer life than SiC products from other vendors.Offering the industry’s broadest voltage range – stretching from 650 V to ultra-high voltages of 2.3 kV to 6.5 kV, the SiC technology has been implemented in multiple projects for MW energy storage and grid-tied inverters with the Department of Energy (DoE).In August 2023, Navitas introduced a high-speed, high-efficiency  3.2 kW CRPS, achieving a 40% smaller size  than best-in-class, legacy silicon solutions for power-hungry AI and Edge computing. This was followed by the  world’s highest power density 4.5 kW  CRPS, achieving a ground-breaking 137 W/in3, and an efficiency of over 97%. In November 2024, Navitas released the  world’s first 8.5 kW  AI data center power supply, powered by GaN and SiC that could meet 98% efficiency, complying with the Open Compute Project (OCP) and Open Rack v3 (ORv3) specifications. Additionally, Navitas created  IntelliWeave, an innovative patented new digital control  technique, that when combined with high-power GaNSafe and Gen 3-Fast SiC MOSFETs, enables PFC peak efficiencies to 99.3% and reduces power losses by 30% compared to existing solutions. Alongside the Computex exhibition in Taiwan, the latest release of their 12 kW PSU was presented at the Navitas ‘ AI Tech Night’ on 21st May.“We are proud to be selected by NVIDIA to collaborate on their 800 HVDC architecture initiative. Our latest innovations in high-power GaN and SiC technologies have seen world firsts and have created new inflections into markets such as AI datacenters and electric vehicles ”, said Gene Sheridan, CEO and co-founder of Navitas. “With our wide portfolio range, we can support NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC infrastructure, from grid to the GPU. We appreciate that NVIDIA recognizes our technology and commitment to driving the next generation of data center power delivery.”NVIDIA’s 800V HVDC architecture will improve end-to-end power efficiency up to 5%, reduce maintenance costs by 70% (due to fewer PSU failures), and lower cooling costs by directly connecting HVDC to the IT and compute racks.To read NVIDIA’s technical blog, please click here .

Cathie Wood Calls Healthcare the Most Overlooked AI Winner,1747692516000,"While everyone's busy chasing the next Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Cathie Wood is leaning into a very different corner of the AI story: healthcare.In a set of recent Bloomberg interviews, the Ark Invest founder said something most investors aren't ready to hear that the biggest gains from artificial intelligence may not come from the companies building the tech, but from the ones quietly using it to rewrite the rules of science.She's talking about drug discovery. Instead of spending years testing combinations in the lab, researchers are now training algorithms to predict what works and they're getting results in weeks. Costs are falling. Timelines are shrinking. And according to Wood, the market hasn't priced in just how big that shift is going to be.It's flying under the radar, according to her.And it's not just AI that's making her bullish. Wood believes the U.S. is entering a more innovation-friendly stretch something she didn't feel under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who she says nearly pushed the crypto industry out of the country. That tide is turning, she says, with digital assets regaining traction and the tech ecosystem breathing a bit easier.Add in the latest round of tariff negotiations which Wood frames as a tax cut in disguise and you've got the makings of a policy backdrop that could supercharge overlooked sectors.This is classic Ark playbook: Go where the long-term story is strong, even if the headlines haven't caught up.

Nvidia lost half its market share in China: find out how,1747857481000,"Nvidia Corp NASDAQ:NVDA is in focus on Wednesday after Jensen Huang, its chief executive, said the AI darling has lost nearly half of its market share in China due to the Trump administration’s new export controls.In a press conference at Computex, he went on to call those restrictions a “failure”, adding they’re not hurting China as much as they’re hurting the US businesses.Huang’s remarks arrive shortly after US President Donald Trump secured a sizable multi-year AI infrastructure deal for Nvidia during his visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Following the tariffs-related crash, Nvidia stock is now up some 45% versus its year-to-date low.US export controls may be helping ChinaAccording to Jensen Huang, recently tightened restrictions on the export of sophisticated chips have slashed Nvidia’s market share in China from a whopping 95% to just 50% within weeks.Additionally, the federal controls are doing more harm to American businesses, also because they have motivated the world’s second-largest economy to accelerate plans of making its own chips, he added.This could prove a threat to the US dominance in artificial intelligence since Huang has already confirmed that Beijing is “right behind” Washington in AI, and now that it’s motivated to design its own chips, it could gain further ground on that front in no time.Note that Nvidia shares are still down some 10% versus their year-to-date high.Huawei could gain share if Nvidia is restricted from selling to ChinaStacy Rasgon, a senior Bernstein analyst, also agrees that making it harder for Nvidia to play in China, the Trump administration is practically giving away the region’s AI market to Huawei.Huawei’s capabilities in artificial intelligence are not lost on Jensen Huang either.“They’re incredible in computing and network technology, all essential capabilities to advance AI. They have made enormous progress in the last several years,” he acknowledged in a recent statement.Investors should note that there have already been reports of Huawei working on its advanced chip that could go neck-and-neck with the US chipmakers, including NVDA, in the coming years.Is Nvidia stock worth buying ahead of Q1 earnings release?Huang’s remarks arrive a week before Nvidia is scheduled to report its earnings for fiscal Q1.Consensus is for the artificial intelligence company to earn 82 cents a share in its current quarter, well above the 58 cents per share it earned in the same quarter last year.Ahead of the chipmaker’s release, the AI stock is worth owning, argued a Loop Capital analyst, Ananda Baruah, in his research note on Wednesday.Baruah maintained his “buy” rating on NVDA shares this morning.He’s convinced the stock could hit $175 over the next 12 months.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia CEO Says 'Deeply Painful' China H20 Ban Will Cut Sales by $15 Billion — Barrons.com,1747680300000,"Tae KimNvidia CEO Jensen Haung has quantified the revenue impact of the U.S. government's latest move to limit chip exports to China: $15 billion.Last month, the administration effectively banned Nvidia's H20 chips to China by tightening chip export licensing requirements to the Asian country. At the time, Nvidia said it expected to take a $5.5 billion charge related to inventory and purchase commitments from the new restrictions for its fiscal first quarter.""This additional ban on Nvidia's H20 is deeply painful,"" Huang said in a Stratechery interview published on Monday. ""We walked away from $15 billion of sales and probably — what is it? — $3 billion worth of taxes"" for the U.S.Critics have said offering Nvidia's artificial-intelligence chips to China — even one or two generations old — can help companies in China catch up to the U.S. in AI technology. Huang disagrees. He believes the restrictions are shortsighted and will, in reality, help China in the long run.The restrictions opens the market in China for increased usage of Huawei's AI chips, he said. If more companies use Huawei's chips and the Chinese company can refine its software, Nvidia's current CUDA software advantage could erode.""Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed,"" Huang said. ""If we don't compete in China, and we allow the Chinese ecosystem to build a rich ecosystem because we're not there to compete for it, and new platforms are developed and they're not American at a time when the world is diffusing AI technology, their leadership and their technology will diffuse all around the world.""The executive also argues by limiting access to Nvidia's products it forces companies to provide financial resources to Huawei, which the company will then use for R&D to compete with Nvidia.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"NVIDIA ""AI Factories"" -- More Than Clever Marketing?",1747676040000,"NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his ""AI Factory"" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about ""AI Factories"" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: ""massively parallel architectures.""I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled ""Get Your MPA in Deep Learning."" Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or ""in parallel,"" without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year ""We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more.""The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night...""AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”""They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, ""tokens"" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet.""NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he’s not talking about Bitcoin.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:9b9d51aa7094b:0-nvidia-ai-factories-more-than-clever-marketing/

Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

D-Wave Stock Surges 28%. The Company Made an Advancement in the Quantum Race. — Barrons.com,1747835280000,"By Mackenzie TatananniD-Wave Quantum said Tuesday that its sixth-generation quantum system had become available over the cloud, marking another development in the race to develop commercially viable quantum computers.The Advantage2 system is the successor to D-Wave's Advantage, which was released in September 2020. For now, customers will be able to access Advantage2 through D-Wave's Leap cloud service, though physical machines will be deployed gradually over the next few years.Management cited the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines could effectively handle.Shares soared 28% to $16.90 on Tuesday. The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.Trevor Lanting, the company's chief development officer, told Barron's that D-Wave had focused on building greater connectivity between quantum bits, or the basic units of information in a quantum machine.""This allows us to pose more complex problems and solve them with the technology, whether they're business optimization problems or lattice materials,"" Lanting explained.Other improvements allowing the technology to run more efficiently, such as improved coherence and a higher energy scale, have reduced its appetite for power compared with previous generations, Lanting said.""Fundamentally, this is energy-efficient computing for hard problems,"" Lanting continued. ""I think you're going to see a lot more focus on the energy footprint of computation over the next decade. It's growing and it's growing fast.""While Advantage2 will only be accessible over the cloud for now, D-Wave plans to upgrade on-premises systems in years to come. These include the machine purchased by the Jülich Supercomputing Centre in February and the system currently being installed at Davidson Technologies' headquarters in Alabama.CEO Alan Baratz told Barron's that an upgrade was a ""multi-month exercise.""""We've got to warm up the system, we've got to install the new processor, we've got to cool down the system, we've got to recalibrate the system — and just the calibration process itself could take four to six months, "" Baratz explained.The CEO has been one of the most outspoken advocates of quantum technology, particularly its commercial applications. This has resulted in pushback from critics including the authors of a short report in April who alleged that the company oversold itself and made false claims about the performance of its systems. (Baratz told Barron's that the allegations were ""ridiculous"" and the report itself was ""full of misinformation."")The report came at a time when shares had already been beaten down substantially. D-Wave and peers began sliding at the end of March following Nvidia's annual developer conference, where timelines for wide-scale deployment of the technology failed to materialize.Investor frustration culminated in a selloff that caused some quantum stocks to see double-digit declines, D-Wave among them. The stock closed down 18% on Nvidia's inaugural ""Quantum Day.""That wasn't the only thing weighing on shares. Ahead of the event, D-Wave claimed it had demonstrated ""quantum supremacy"" after one of its systems completed a materials simulation task in 20 minutes that would've taken one of the world's most powerful supercomputers nearly 1 million years.Shares climbed on the heels of the announcement, but as scrutiny mounted those gains slipped away. The stock's most recent ascent came on the heels of D-Wave's first-quarter financial results, which included record revenue and a narrower quarterly loss.The caveat about quantum pure-plays is that they are not yet profitable. This has been a pervasive issue for the industry, with stocks trading largely on headlines and sentiment.While D-Wave didn't turn a profit in its latest quarter, revenue increased 509% from a year earlier. Bookings, a metric representing customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future, decreased 64% to $1.6 million.Baratz had an explanation. ""We're in the early stages of commercializing quantum, so as we're getting started, bookings are going to be more lumpy as opposed to smoothly increasing,"" the CEO said.The metric can be parsed into three types of deals: professional services, quantum-as-a-service, and system sales. System sales carry a hefty price tag, to the tune of $20 to $40 million apiece, and have a longer lead time as a result.The cost barrier is one reason why it's difficult to determine a timeline for wide-scale deployment. Another is the sensitive nature of quantum computers themselves. As the basic units of information in a system are subatomic particles like photons or electrons, this makes them particularly sensitive to environmental interference, which can cause the machines to bungle calculations.Until these more pervasive issues are resolved, it is unclear when quantum computing will catch on. However, the technology has the potential to dramatically transform the field of drug discovery, artificial intelligence, and the financial sector.D-Wave, for one, is already at work on its next generation of quantum processors, with a focus on increasing qubit count to create more powerful multi-chip solutions.'We're able to do calculations beyond the reach of possibility for classical systems,"" Lanting told Barron's. ""There is a gap and that gap will continue to open up very rapidly. That's the promise of quantum computing.""Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"HPE Stock Is Rising Again. Expect More Gains, Analyst Says. — Barrons.com",1747835160000,"Mackenzie TatananniShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise have slumped this year due to disappointing financial results and broader market weakness. However, analysts believe the stock could see explosive gains, with their most optimistic case forecasting 72% upside to the current price.Evercore ISI analysts upgraded shares of the server and cloud-software company to Outperform from In Line, and lifted the price target to $22 from $17, citing a ""fairly attractive"" risk-reward balance, ""specially for investors that have some duration.""Shares climbed 3.4% to $18.05, on pace for their highest close since March 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.The Evercore upgrade had much to do with it. In the Tuesday note, analysts presented a handful scenarios showing how the stock price could rise as high as $31 or sink as low as $15.Investors are waiting for the Justice Department to approve HPE's merger with Juniper Networks after moving to block it earlier this year. (Evercore expects ""some concessions from HPE"" to push the deal through.)In this upside scenario, the analysts expect HPE to deliver ""double-digit [earnings per share] growth"" through the first year following the merger, with operational issues also being resolved. In their view, earnings growth could lift the stock to around $24.If the Juniper deal doesn't pan out, the analysts believe this could drive the stock price even higher. Out of options, HPE might be forced to employ ""aggressive cost reduction and optimization efforts"" to improve operating margins across both its Hybrid Cloud and Intelligence Edge segments.""This would effectively provide an 'alternative' path to an activist asking for an excessive/levered buyback,"" the analysts wrote. Like the first argument, they believe earnings growth could push HPE shares to $26 to $31.The firm's least-favorable scenario calls for ""business as usual,"" with the deal not closing, and HPE ""maintaining the status quo."" That would keep the stock range-bound, between $15 and $16, the Evercore team said.Another news item may have contributed to the stock's ascent on Tuesday. The Evercore upgrade came after HP announced it had fine-tuned its HPE Private Cloud AI, which it co-developed with Nvidia, ""to further aid AI developers.""HPE stock ended Monday's session down 1.6%. The year-to-date loss stood at 16%, tamped down by a mix of macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointing financial results.The stock cratered in March after HPE posted a mixed first-quarter print, including guidance that undershot expectations. Shares are off 26% from a record high of $24.42, set on Jan. 22.Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Nvidia opens NVLink Fusion ecosystem, expands Taiwan footprint with Foxconn",1747670074000,"Nvidia has unveiled a major expansion to its AI hardware strategy with the launch of NVLink Fusion, a platform that allows third-party processors to work seamlessly alongside Nvidia GPUs. Previously restricted to Nvidia’s own chips, the NVLink interconnect technology will now support central processing units (CPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from external vendors. The move, announced by CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote at Computex 2025 in Taiwan, marks a shift in Nvidia’s approach—one that aims to secure its position at the heart of next-generation AI infrastructure, even in hybrid systems that do not rely exclusively on its components.MediaTek, Qualcomm, and others onboard NVLink FusionThe new NVLink Fusion programme has already secured a number of key partners. Chipmakers including MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence have joined the initiative. The integration enables clients such as Qualcomm Technologies and Fujitsu to connect their own CPUs to Nvidia GPUs in AI data centre environments. By doing so, these companies can benefit from Nvidia’s ecosystem and interconnect bandwidth while maintaining flexibility in hardware design.This development allows clients to build semi-custom AI systems, rather than relying solely on off-the-shelf solutions from Nvidia.Ray Wang, a US-based technology analyst, noted that NVLink Fusion helps Nvidia tap into demand for data centres built on ASICs, traditionally considered alternatives to Nvidia’s general-purpose graphics processors. Wang said the new approach “consolidates Nvidia as the centre of next-generation AI factories”, especially as tech giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft continue developing proprietary AI chips.Nvidia responds to custom chip competitionNvidia currently dominates the GPU market used in general AI training, but it faces increasing competition from hyperscalers investing in custom silicon. The new NVLink Fusion strategy appears to be a direct response, allowing Nvidia to retain a role in AI compute systems that integrate diverse hardware.According to Rolf Bulk, equity analyst at New Street Research, the flexibility offered by NVLink Fusion could reduce demand for Nvidia’s own CPUs. However, he pointed out that at the system level, the feature makes Nvidia’s GPUs more attractive to customers exploring alternative system architectures. While tech rivals AMD, Intel, and Broadcom are notably absent from the Fusion ecosystem, Nvidia’s willingness to work with competitors’ chips could help cement its dominance in AI compute environments, even as the architecture landscape becomes more fragmented.New DGX Cloud platform and Taiwan expansionAlongside NVLink Fusion, Nvidia also introduced the DGX Cloud Lepton, a platform designed to provide developers with access to tens of thousands of GPUs through a unified global marketplace. The system aims to address GPU supply shortages and streamline access to compute capacity across Nvidia’s cloud network.In a regional boost, Huang also announced plans for a new office and AI supercomputer project in Taiwan in collaboration with Foxconn, officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group. The move reinforces Taiwan’s role as a global AI hub and expands Nvidia’s presence in Asia, a critical market for its supply chain and ecosystem partners, including chip foundry TSMC.The upcoming GB300 Grace Blackwell system, scheduled for release in Q3 2025, will offer a leap in performance for AI workloads and further complement Nvidia’s evolving product stack.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:572977b64094b:0-nvidia-opens-nvlink-fusion-ecosystem-expands-taiwan-footprint-with-foxconn/
Hims & Hers Health and AST SpaceMobile have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1748004600000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Tutor Perini Corp. TPC as the Bull of the Day and YETI Holdings, Inc. YETI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Tutor Perini Corp. just beat and raised 2025 earnings guidance as its construction backlog hit a record high. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) expects earnings in 2026 and 2027 to more than double 2025 earnings.Tutor Perini is a civil, building and specialty construction company offering general contracting and design-build services to private customers and public agencies worldwide. It has expertise on large, complex projects.Tutor Perini often self-performs multiple project components including earthwork, excavation, concrete forming and placement, steel erection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditions as well as fire protection.It's a small cap company with a market cap of $1.88 billion.Big Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini reported its first quarter 2025 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 783%. It reported earnings of $0.53 compared to the Zacks Consensus of just $0.06.It was the company's second best first quarter EPS ever.Tutor Perini has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters.Revenue was up 19% to $1.25 billion from $1.05 billion in the year ago period. Growth was solid across all three segments but was primarily driven by increased project execution activities on certain newer, higher-margin projects. These projects have significant scope of work remaining.During the first quarter, the company voluntarily repaid the remaining $121.9 million outstanding balance of the Term Loan B, which contributed to a 24% reduction in the company's total debt as compared to the total debt at the end of 2024.Tutor Perini expects solid operating cash flow for the rest of 2025.Tutor Perini has a Record BacklogThe business keeps rolling in. In the first quarter, Tutor Perini booked another $2 billion in new awards and contract adjustments, bringing the company's new backlog to a record of $19.4 billion as of March 31, 2025.That is up 94% compared to the end of the first quarter of 2024.Included in those new awards and contracts was the $1.18 billion Manhattan Tunnel project in New York; a $100 million electrical project in Texas; $241 million in additional funding for the Apra Harbor Waterfront Repairs project in Guam; and $111 million of additional funding for certain healthcare facility projects in California.Additionally, the backlog is expected to remain robust as it has already won more than $500 million in new awards in the second quarter of 2025.But it is not resting on these laurels. Other big projects are available. In the Civil segment, Tutor Perini recently bid the multi-billion-dollar Midtown Bus Terminal Replacement project in New York and was awaiting contractor selection by the owner.Tutor Perini Expects No Impact from the TariffsMany investors are worried about the impact of the 2025 tariffs. As of May 7, 2025, Tutor Perini did not expect to see any significant impact from the tariffs or the curtailment of federal funding.But they will take that quarter by quarter.Tutor Perini Raised Full Year Earnings GuidanceWith a record backlog and opportunities to add to it further, it's not a surprise that Tutor Perini is bullish about 2025.It raised full year earnings guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.95 from its prior guidance of $1.50 to $1.90.Tutor Perini is lightly followed on the Street, but one analyst did raise their earnings estimates for both 2025 and 2026 after the earnings report.The Zacks Consensus jumped to $1.84 from $1.53 prior to the report. That is earnings growth of 158.8% as the company lost $3.13 last year.2026 is also looking bullish as the company said they expect earnings to more than double that of 2025 in 2026 and 2027.1 estimate was raised for 2026 in the last 30 days as well, pushing up 2026 to $2.87. That is further earnings growth of 56%.Here's what it looks like on the 5-year price and consensus chart.Shares Soar in 2025Tutor Perini is a small cap company. The small caps have struggled in 2025 but not Tutor Perini.Shares soared to new 5-year highs on the earnings beat and guidance raise and are outperforming the Russell 2000 small cap index year-to-date.Yet, the company is still attractively priced. Tutor Perini trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 19.3.But it has even cheaper value metrics with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.4 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. A P/S ratio under 1.0 and a P/B ratio under 3.0 usually indicate value.With a record backlog, Tutor Perini is a small cap stock to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:YETI Holdings, Inc. cut guidance in May 2025 due to the impact of the tariffs. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is now expected to see a double-digit decline in earnings this year.YETI is a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor products worldwide. This includes coolers, drinkware, backpacks and bags.A Beat in the First Quarter of 2025On May 8, 2025, YETI reported its first quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.04. Earnings were $0.31 compared to the consensus of $0.27.This was the 5th earnings beat in a row.Net sales rose 3% to $351.1 million from $341.4 million a year ago. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 4% to $196.2 million primarily due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.While Wholesale channel sales rose just 1% to $154.9 million, also due to growth in Coolers & Equipment.However, the first quarter seems like a different world as Liberation Day tariffs changed the business in April.YETI's Plan to Mitigate the TariffsYETI already had a plan for supply chain diversification, which is ahead of plan. It is aggressively diversifying its sourcing out of China.It expects, by the end of 2025, to have limited exposure to future goods sourced from China. Less than 5% of its total costs of goods will be related to products from China, for the U.S. market.YETI's ability to generate cash is expected to be intact, even with the disruption from the tariff impacts.YETI Lowers 2025 GuidanceBut while it is mitigating the tariffs, sales and earnings are still expected to be impacted.For 2025, adjusted sales are expected to increase between 1% and 4%, down from its prior projection of 5% to 7%.Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.02, down from the prior projection of $2.90 to $2.95.Not surprisingly, the analysts had to cut their estimates to get in line with the new guidance. 10 estimates were cut in the last 30 days for 2025.The Zacks Consensus fell to $2.04 from $2.88. That's down 25.3% from 2024, when YETI made $2.73.10 estimates were also cut for 2026.You can see the results on the price and consensus chart.Shares Near 1-Year LowsYETI was a pandemic winner as people headed outdoors. But since 2022, it's been tougher.Shares are down double digits over the last year.It's cheap. It trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. A P/E under 15 usually indicates value.YETI has a strong balance sheet. It had cash of $259 million as of the end of the first quarter and total debt of $77 million.However, it lowered its 2025 free cash flow guidance to a range of $100 to $125 million from $200 million due to the impact from supply chain disruptions as well as higher tariff cost.Investors interested in YETI might want to wait for more certainty on the tariff fall-out before jumping in.Additional content:3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Scales All-Time HighsThe cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. , PayPal Holdings and NVIDIA Corp. . Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers.Bitcoin's rally followed the U.S. equity market's slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value.Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing.Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market.3 Crypto-Centric Stocks With UpsideVisaVisa Inc. is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement.

Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Criticizes AI Chip Curbs as Market Share in China Falls,1747834697000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) chief executive Jensen Huang said U.S. export controls on AI chips to China had backfired, cutting the company's market share and accelerating the rise of Chinese chipmakers like Huawei.Revenue figures weren't disclosed, but Huang said Nvidia's share of the AI chip market in China plunged to 50% from nearly 95% since the start of former President Joe Biden's administration. He attributed the decline to U.S. restrictions on the export of advanced chips, which spurred Chinese firms to develop alternatives.Huang said the export curbs energized local players, giving them spirit, energy, and government support to build a self-reliant semiconductor supply chain. Huawei and others have reportedly filled demand gaps left by U.S. companies.The Biden-era restrictions were intended to limit China's access to AI chips over national security concerns. However, Huang said former President Donald Trump's decision last week to roll back parts of the policy reflected a better understanding of global competition. He said the prior approach had the wrong goal.Beijing condemned fresh U.S. guidance discouraging the use of Chinese chips, saying it violated earlier trade understandings and warning of firm steps if U.S. actions harm Chinese interests.- Explore Nvidia's insider activity. - See valuation trends on the Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1c26b4f3e094b:0-nvidia-nvda-ceo-criticizes-ai-chip-curbs-as-market-share-in-china-falls/

""The market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names,"" Wedbush said. President Donald Trump's Middle East trip culminated in deals for the delivery of 18,000 Nvidia chips to Saudi Arabia for a 500-megawatt data center and for the largest AI data center outside the US in Abu Dhabi, the report said. The announcements mark the ""start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,"" said the investment firm. The ""massive AI buildout"" in Saudi Arabia and the UAE might open up a ""huge opportunity"" and total addressable market in the next decade for Nvidia, Palantir Technologies NASDAQ:PLTR , Microsoft, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and other companies, Wedbush said. The tech boom in the Middle East ""also speaks to this global game of high stakes poker being played by the Trump administration"" as China faces US chip restrictions, the report said. "" China is clearly taking notice and this adds to the drama"" of broader US-China trade talks, Wedbush said.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250519:A3381313:0/
Nvidia Stock Rises. Why Next Week Is a Big One for the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1748002440000,"By George Glover and Adam ClarkNvidia stock was edging higher in muted trading on Friday, with the artificial-intelligence chip maker's next blockbuster earnings report now just days away.Shares ticked up 0.1% to $132.90 in early trading. Futures tracking the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.3%.Friday is expected to be a quiet trading session, with many on Wall Street already looking forward to the Memorial Day long weekend. But next week ought to be a big one for Nvidia, with the company set to post its first-quarter results after Wednesday's close.The report is expected to underline surging AI demand. Analysts expect earnings of 73 cents a share and forecast that revenue will jump 66% from a year ago to $43.3 billion, according to a FactSet poll.""We believe that demand for H200 [chips], coupled with initial GB200 ramps should drive a modest beat relative to consensus/guidance, despite in quarter disruption of H20 sales to China,"" wrote Stifel analyst Ruben Roy in a research note.Nvidia is set to lose out on $15 billion worth of sales from the Trump administration's tightened controls over its H20 chip for the Chinese market, according to CEO Jensen Huang.""We would expect this set of results/outlook to drive sideways to modestly higher share price performance given the imminent GB300 ramp later this year.""Roy has a Buy rating and $180 target price.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices shares climbed 0.7% Friday.

"Nvidia CEO Backs Trump, Criticizes AI Chip Curbs",1747831857000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang criticized the U.S. government's restrictions on exporting artificial intelligence chips to China, calling the policy a ""failure"" that cost American companies billions in lost revenue.Speaking at the Computex conference in Taipei, Huang said the Biden-era export rules created under the so-called AI Diffusion policy were based on flawed assumptions. The rules, introduced in January, blocked high-end processor sales to China and limited supply to other countries. Huang emphasized that over half of the world's AI researchers are based in China, and the U.S. restrictions forced many to turn to local suppliers like Huawei.President Donald Trump has said he plans to end the policy if re-elected. Huang voiced support for that plan, saying it acknowledges that U.S. firms are not the only providers of advanced chips. Earlier this year, Microsoft raised similar concerns, saying the policy could boost China's AI sector.Nvidia's share of the Chinese AI chip market has dropped from 95% to 50% since President Biden took office. Huang estimated the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion next year, a major opportunity the company risks missing.Earlier this week, Nvidia said the U.S. licensing rule for its H20 GPUs could cost it $15 billion in revenue.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:928c4848f094b:0-nvidia-ceo-backs-trump-criticizes-ai-chip-curbs/
Middle East Seen as Next Theater of AI Revolution — Market Talk,1747668600000,"The next major area of penetration for the AI revolution appears to be the Middle East, Dan Ives and other Wedbush analysts say in a research note. President Trump was recently there to negotiate a deal to have the U.S. tech sector make data centers, supercomputers, software, and overall infrastructure for a massive AI buildout in Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E in the coming years, the analysts say. Saudi Arabia is now due to get 18,000 Nvidia chips for a massive data center while the U.A.E. has Trump's support to guild the largest data center outside of the U.S., two factors that should start an era of new growth for the U.S. tech sector and be a game-changer for the industry, the analysts say.

Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The number of customers generating over $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenues grew 7% year over year, while churn rates reached record lows. This trend is expected to have persisted in the to-be-reported quarter, supported by continued momentum in Zoom Phone, Contact Center, and Workvivo, particularly as large deals likely ramped up.The Online business segment, which includes SMB and individual customers, is expected to have remained flat to slightly down during the quarter. This performance reflects ongoing stabilization trends, including record-low churn levels achieved in the previous quarter. In contrast, Zoom’s Enterprise segment is anticipated to have carried the bulk of the growth in the fiscal first quarter. Large deal wins, such as the deployment of Zoom solutions to Amazon employees and Delta Airlines' adoption of Workvivo, is expected to have reinforced the platform’s relevance and appeal to upmarket clients.From a bottom-line perspective, strategic investments in AI are expected to have weighed on gross margins, though the company remains committed to achieving long-term efficiency gains. Zoom’s federated AI approach and infrastructure optimization efforts are expected to have helped offset these costs in the fiscal first quarter, keeping operating margins stable near 39%. Additionally, free cash flow in the quarter under review is expected to have been impacted by timing differences, tax conditions and changes in interest rates.What Our Model Says for ZMPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.ZM currently has an Earnings ESP of -1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Nvidia (NVDA) Backs Trump Plan to Reverse AI Chip Curbs,1747830637000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) CEO Jensen Huang said the U.S. export curbs on AI chips to China failed to achieve their goals and instead caused major financial harm to American companies. He endorsed the Trump administration's effort to abandon the tiered restrictions.Nvidia has taken a $5.5 billion charge related to U.S. limits on exports of its H20 chips to China. Huang estimated the restrictions could cost Nvidia up to $15 billion in lost revenue.The company's China market share dropped to 50% from 95% since the Biden administration imposed the AI diffusion rule, which blocked advanced chip exports to China. In response, Chinese firms like Huawei gained traction, and the country boosted its domestic chip infrastructure.Huang said competition in China has become intense and noted that many in the country would prefer Nvidia not return. He projected the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion by 2026, a key opportunity despite geopolitical hurdles.To navigate current limits, Nvidia is working on a modified Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with U.S. rules. Meanwhile, China has demanded that Washington remove discriminatory chip measures, warning of further action if curbs persist.The Trump administration is reportedly considering a new global licensing regime to replace the existing three-tier model, which could give the U.S. more leverage in trade negotiations.- See insider trades for NVDA. - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:15ffb745a094b:0-nvidia-nvda-backs-trump-plan-to-reverse-ai-chip-curbs/

Malaysia government not involved in local AI project involving Huawei chips,1747829410000,"Malaysia's government did not develop, coordinate or endorse an artificial intelligence project involving a local company and Huawei Technologies, its trade ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, backtracking on a previous announcement. The statement followed local media reports on Monday that a Malaysian company, Skyvast Corporation, would deploy Huawei's Ascend chips for the project. The ministry said it wanted ""to clarify that the said initiative was not developed, endorsed, or coordinated by the Government of Malaysia, nor does it form part of any Government-to-Government agreement or nationally mandated technology programme.""Huawei told Reuters that it has not sold any Ascend chips in Malaysia, and the Malaysian government has not purchased any of those chips from them. Huawei developed the Ascend chips after it was blocked by the U.S. government from receiving advanced semiconductors. The chips have since become an alternative for Chinese firms after Washington moved to further curb sales of high-end chips by top AI chip maker Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA to China. The Trade Ministry added that the country remains committed to fully complying with all applicable export control laws, national security directives, and emerging guidance from global regulatory authorities.

Update: Nvidia Stock Falls. What's Overshadowing Its AI Chip Moves. — Barrons.com,1747665120000,"By George Glover and Adam ClarkNvidia stock was dropping early Monday as investor angst about the broader market overshadowed a series of moves to expand the artificial-intelligence chip maker's dominance.Shares were down 0.9% to $134.20 in early trading. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% after Moody's cut its rating on U.S. sovereign debt. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was down 1.8% and Broadcom was broadly flat.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Monday at the Computex trade show in Taiwan that the company will be opening its AI server platform to rival chip makers including Qualcomm and Marvell Technology.""Some would say this announcement is defensive vs. Broadcom, but we think it is a very smart move that keeps Nvidia at the center of your AI Data Center wallet by enabling custom silicon scale-up to meet the requirements of demanding AI workloads,"" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a research note.Reitzes has a Buy rating and $150 target price on Nvidia stock.Nvidia also said it would be working with iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to build an AI factory supercomputer in Taiwan, powered by 10,000 of its Blackwell graphics-processing units. Foxconn will provide the AI infrastructure, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will use it for research and development.""We are delighted to partner with Foxconn and Taiwan to help build Taiwan's AI infrastructure, and to support TSMC and other leading companies to advance innovation in the age of AI and robotics,"" Huang said in a statement.Nvidia said it is deepening its partnerships with Taiwanese system manufacturers, including Acer, Asus and Gigabyte, to build Nvidia DGX Spark and DGX Station systems, which are its new high-performance desktop supercomputers.In a separate announcement, Nvidia was unveiled as a partner in a joint venture to establish Europe's largest ""AI campus"" in France. The other partners include French AI company Mistral, France's national national investment bank Bpifrance, and MGX, an UAE investment fund.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/
Nvidia's Huang Calls U.S. Export Controls a Failure — WSJ,1747828080000,"By Liza LinTAIPEI — Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said U.S. export controls limiting the sale of advanced chips to China were a failure, contending they have galvanized Beijing to push ahead faster with its own artificial-intelligence technologies.Nvidia has over the past four years lost market share to Chinese competitors because of the restrictions, Huang said.""The local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls give them the spirit, energy and the government support to accelerate their development,"" Huang said Wednesday in Taipei, where he is attending an industry conference.The Biden administration introduced a series of measures crimping the ability of U.S. companies to sell cutting-edge chips, chip-related equipment and technologies to China over national-security concerns. The curbs have particularly affected Nvidia, the leader in chips for AI applications.Many remain in place under President Trump, and the Trump administration added a control in April on the export of an Nvidia AI chip that the company had tailored for sale in China. Nvidia said it would take a $5.5 billion charge over the issue.Huang said China was the second-largest computer market globally and would be a $50 billion AI market next year. Revenue from China, he said, could translate to tax dollars and jobs for the U.S.""I think all along the export control was a failure,"" Huang said.At the same time, he praised Trump for reversing one export-control plan that Nvidia had forcefully criticized. In the final days of the Biden administration, officials released a draft of an AI diffusion rule that would have put country caps on the sale of AI chips around the globe, not just to China. The rule was aimed at making it harder for China to access U.S. technology through third countries.The Trump administration rescinded the rule this month before it took effect.""The goal of the AI diffusion rule as specified in the past was to limit AI diffusion. President Trump realizes that it's exactly the wrong goals, "" Huang said.""America is not the only provider of AI technology,"" he said. ""If the United States wants to stay in the lead and the U.S. would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, then we would have to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed.""The removal of the diffusion rule has benefited both Nvidia and countries in places such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia that otherwise would have been curtailed in their ability to build large AI facilities.Days after the rule was pulled, American chip makers including Nvidia unveiled deals to sell hundreds of thousands of the most powerful chips in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar during a visit by Trump and Huang to the region.Huang has crisscrossed the globe over the past month, trying to drum up sales of his AI processors and excitement for his vision of a future driven by AI supercomputers. He has drawn closer to governments around the globe because of the geopolitical importance of AI, standing by Trump's side in the Middle East and meeting senior Chinese officials.Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521002942:0/

"Amid 'Jensanity', Nvidia signals plans to keep AI crown",1747989780000,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang flew out of Taipei on Friday after a week revelling in the adoration of Taiwan's tech industry, and delivering a subtle but crucial message from the U.S. AI chip king on how it plans to keep its crown. While 'Jensanity' swirled around Huang at the Computex trade fair, Nvidia itself was at a crossroads. Having grown to become the world's most valuable chip company, investors fear a drop in spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as damage to sales from U.S. trade friction.U.S. restrictions on high-tech exports have seen Nvidia lose market share in China as it withdraws chips and designs inferior alternatives compliant with evolving U.S. policy. Now, cloud computing giants such as Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have signalled cuts to AI spending. And while the 62-year old CEO has in the past month announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars in regions such as the Gulf, analysts said such deals are likely to become scarce.""Is every country going to announce a $10 billion or $50 billion data centre like the Saudis? Of course not,"" said Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg. ""They're sort of running out of obvious deals."" When asked by Reuters how Nvidia planned to deal with AI spending slowdown, Huang said, ""AI infrastructure is being built out (everywhere) - that's one of the reasons I'm travelling around the world... AI infrastructure is going to be a part of society."" NEW GROWTHAt Computex, Huang revealed a means of growth that does not rely on mega sovereign infrastructure arrangements: new technology that expands Nvidia's grip on the AI market.The tech's centrepiece is called NVLink Fusion. It allows companies to plug custom chips into Nvidia's AI infrastructure, thereby becoming a platform upon which others can build. ""Instead of having to build the entire rack of equipment themselves, (companies) could innovate or differentiate on the custom (chip) itself,"" said Nick Kucharewski, vice president at Marvell Technology NASDAQ:MRVL .The bet is that drawing companies to build hardware that utilises Nvidia's Fusion platform will drive demand for the underlying AI network and data centre parts that Nvidia sells.Nvidia has also begun to reach into the enterprise market. This week, it launched a line of servers that Huang described as an ""enterprise AI supercomputer"".Huang's pitch was that the servers open up a multi-billion dollar market because customers can use them for ""everything"", such as graphics, virtual machines and AI applications. The enterprise market is large but difficult to break into, said Seaport Research's Goldberg. Deals tend to be small - compared with a sovereign data centre - and more expensive and time-consuming to win.""My sense is we're sort of bumping up against the limits of expanding the customer base,"" Goldberg said.TAIWAN ECOSYSTEM Nvidia works with some of Taiwan's biggest names in tech, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TWSE:2330 , which makes many of its chips. However, the underlying infrastructure for AI would not be possible without the hundreds of Taiwanese companies big and small supplying components and manufacturing know-how needed to construct Nvidia's complex AI systems.""The purpose of Computex was to bring together the ecosystem and the supply chain,"" said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at consultancy More Than Moore.Such a network is necessary to support the deals announced in the Gulf and that are likely coming elsewhere in the world in the coming months, Cutress said.Taiwanese industry has embraced Huang, who is perceived as a local-born hero hailing from Taiwan's historic capital of Tainan before migrating to the U.S. when he was nine years old.By the time he flew out on Friday, Huang had appeared on stage or at banquets with nearly every prominent Taiwanese tech executive, including Chairman Young Liu of AI server builder Foxconn TWSE:2317 who called him the ""leader of Team Taiwan"".MediaTek TWSE:2454 CEO Rick Tsai gave Huang chunks of guava in a plastic bag from the Nvidia leader's favoured fruit stall in Taipei during one of the chip designer's events.Solomon Technology TWSE:2359 , a provider of industrial automation and AI-based inspection solutions which uses Nvidia's software tools, said working with Nvidia is a win-win situation.Shares of Solomon have surged 241% since Huang mentioned the firm at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in March last year.""The collaboration with Nvidia has given us greater visibility. We weren't very well-known before, but with Nvidia's support, many more people know us now,"" said Solomon Chairman Johnny Chen.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RV068:0-amid-jensanity-nvidia-signals-plans-to-keep-ai-crown/"

""All in all, the export controls were a failure. The facts would suggest it,"" Huang was quoted as saying. Huang said the controls have prompted Chinese firms to shift purchases to domestic chipmakers, including Huawei. He added that the restrictions also accelerated China's efforts to build a domestic semiconductor supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign technology. Speaking at the at the Computex event in Taipei, Huang said Nvidia's market share in China has dropped to 50% from 95% at the beginning of President Joe Biden's administration.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250521:A3382628:0/

NVDA: Nvidia Stock in the Red for the Year Ahead of Big Earnings Update. Here’s What to Expect.,1747988409000,"Chipmaker is floating at a loss for the year as the AI run has lost some of its steam. Can the quarterly figures catapult the shares in the black? 📉 Nvidia in Red in 2025- Nvidia stock NASDAQ:NVDA was gyrating 4% under the flatline for the year Thursday as traders and investors were cautiously waiting for the company’s first-fiscal quarter 2026 earnings report. - Coming Wednesday, May 28, after the closing bell, this one’s going to be a massive event that could shake the fabric of the stock market. 🧐 The Figures: Big Hopes- Investors are looking for Nvidia to pull off another blockbuster print — or risk deeper doubt that the AI-fueled rally can keep pace. - Expectations are high: the Street is eyeballing earnings per share of $0.73, up from $0.61 a year earlier, and a staggering, record $43.3 billion in revenue versus $26 billion picked up at the same time last year. 🥊 $5.5 Billion Hit- There’s also a potential hit that could weigh on Nvidia’s top and bottom lines. The chipmaker recently disclosed a $5.5 billion writeoff tied to H20 chips designed for the Chinese market. Why? US export controls torpedoed Nvidia’s ability to sell them. - That painful loss — even for a company with Nvidia’s firepower — raises questions about the vital China exposure and whether that part of the business can be made whole. 🎤 Hear It from the Man Himself- Besides the actual performance figures for the quarter, markets will be tuning in to hear from the man himself. Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, will be speaking to shareholders, presenting the roadmap and laying out the forward guidance. - Is there a pivot in play to replace lost China revenue? What’s the status of AI chip demand in other markets? But also, what’s up with the shift to selling to whole nations as a way to diversify away from selling to Big Tech? 🎨 New Revenue Streams in the Works- That’s the potentially bullish case. Nvidia is expanding its footprint in the Middle East . The company has been deepening ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where sovereign-backed AI investments are ramping up. - While it’s early innings, Wall Street will be eager to hear whether Gulf demand can help fill the China gap — and whether it will show up on the revenue line this year or next.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:854a3c676094b:0-nvda-nvidia-stock-in-the-red-for-the-year-ahead-of-big-earnings-update-here-s-what-to-expect/
Market Chatter: Crusoe Receives $11.6 Billion in Funding for OpenAI Data Center in Texas,1747825916000,"Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's partner Crusoe has received $11.6 billion in new funding commitments for a data center in Abilene, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The funding, which will come from a mixture of debt and equity provided by Blue Owl Capital (OWL) and Crusoe, will expand the data center to eight buildings from its previously planned two, each equipped with up to 50,000 Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Blackwell chips, the report said. Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle NYSE:ORCL agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI agreed to rent servers from Oracle while Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips, according to the report.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent. Higher yields tend to compress valuations for growth stocks, which rely on future earnings.Read more: Adani, Tata, Vedanta make a power play for coal-fired projects after five-year lullThe downbeat session came just after markets closed out a stellar week. Investors had cheered a breakthrough in trade negotiations, with the U.S. and China agreeing to pause tariff hikes, lifting global risk appetite. The Nasdaq had rallied over 7 percent last week, while the S&P 500 gained more than 5 percent over five straight sessions. The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone. Walmart shares slipped 1.7 percent after President Trump suggested the retailer should shoulder the burden of tariffs, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said CEO Doug McMillon had agreed to absorb some levies. Netflix dropped 2 percent after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral, citing its sharp rally.

NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion Ups the Ante for AI Infrastructure,1747663620000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NVDA] NVIDIA’s NASDAQ:NVDA CEO, Jensen Huang , made numerous announcements at the Computex 2025 conference that amount to one thing: NVIDIA remains at the center of all things AI. While competitors advance their technologies, they remain steps behind and may never catch up due to this critical factor: NVIDIA launched NVLink Fusion .NVIDIA NVLink is the technology linking NVIDIA GPUs and CPUs into functional supercomputers. It is the framework upon which most AI data centers are built and is now open to third-party manufacturers. Until now, NVIDIA GPUs were linked using NVIDIA’s NVLink and NVIDIA CPUs. Now, NVIDIA GPUs can be linked with third-party CPUs and ASICs, increasing the options for building semi-custom AI infrastructure and opening new revenue streams for NVIDIA.The system works with an NVIDIA chiplet that can be integrated into any ASIC or CPU. The initial announcement included commitments from numerous  semiconductor manufacturers already planning to use the technology, and more, eventually all, are expected to join the network over time. Other critical announcements at the Computex 2025 conference include updates to existing technology , upcoming product launches , and services for AI developers . The crucial product update is the RTX Pro Server , which is now in volume production. It increases performance roughly 2x to 4x, depending on the AI model, compared to the original H100 AI GPU .Other updates include the expected launch of GB300 systems later this year, an advancement of the Grace Blackwell product line , and DGX Cloud Lepton , an SaaS service linking AI developers with crucial cloud resources and computing power. NVIDIA Analysts Raise Revenue Estimates Ahead of Q1 ReleaseNVIDIA will report strong results for Q1 2025 and provide robust guidance for the year. The Computex 2025 announcements reaffirm the existing outlook and provide additional revenue streams, including a new project with Foxconn . Foxconn, a supplier to Apple , will build an advanced AI supercomputer in Taiwan using 10,000 of NVIDIA’s GPUs. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NVDA] The project will provide computing power for Taiwanese businesses, including Taiwan Semiconductor . The takeaway for investors is that analysts expect to see NVIDIA provide solid results and guidance and lift their targets ahead of the release. MarketBeat's consensus in late May is up nearly 500 basis points month-to-month, forecasting more than 65% growth on the top line . The analysts’ trends in April and May included sufficient price target reductions to land the stock on MarketBeat’s Most Dowgraded Stocks list, but investors need to look past that label. The consensus remains bullish, rated firmly at a Moderate Buy with  coverage increasing and sentiment firming , and the price target assumes that more than 20% upside is still available.The Computex announcements are a catalyst, likely to lead the analysts to revert to price target increases and spur the rally back into action. As it is, the $165 price target is sufficient for a new all-time high likely reached in tandem or shortly after the Q1 earnings report. NVIDIA’s Industry-Leading Position in AI Is Assured for Another Few YearsThe net result of NVIDIA's May 2025 news, including the deals in Saudi Arabia , is that its position as the AI industry leader is assured for another few years, highlighting the deep value opportunity that is still available. The stock trades at only 31x its current year earnings compared to over 45x in recent years, and only 20x compared to the 2030 forecast and 12x relative to 20235, suggesting significant gains lie ahead.Assuming the company only performs as expected over the next decade, it could rise by another 100% to 200% to trade in the range of 24x to 36x its 2035 forecast. The technical action in May is bullish . Although macroeconomic headwinds remain and market action is volatile, the rebound is strong and on track to retest all-time highs soon. A move to new highs would be significant, indicating a shift in market dynamics from wait-and-see into rally mode, and bring targets near $160 into play . Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f1cf434cc094b:0-nvidia-s-nvlink-fusion-ups-the-ante-for-ai-infrastructure/

"Nvidia Remains 'Best Positioned' in AI Despite China Export Restrictions, Oppenheimer Says",1747940319000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA remains ""best positioned"" in artificial intelligence despite the loss of H20 chip sales to China following US government restrictions, Oppenheimer said in a Thursday note. The firm said it sees upside to the company's fiscal Q1 results due next week and expects the company to issue fiscal Q2 outlook in line with analyst expectations. Oppenheimer expects the chipmaker to report fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings of $0.92 per share, up from its previous forecast of $0.91. Segment wise, the firm said it expects the data center business to record a 71% increase in revenue year-over-year thanks to ""robust demand"" for the company's GB200 AI systems. Oppenheimer said production of the flagship rack-scale systems appears to have moved past initial growing pains. The firm said it also sees sovereign AI as a growing portion of Nvidia's revenue, with China representing a total addressable market of $50 billion. The firm expects a potential China-compliant SKU from Nvidia in July. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously called US export restrictions on AI chips to China a ""failure,"" saying the measures have prompted Chinese firms to shift purchases to domestic chipmakers, including Huawei. Still, as recently as Wednesday, the White House said it would maintain its efforts to prevent advanced AI technology from reaching China, rebuffing Huang's call for relief. China currently represents less than 5% of Nvidia's sales, Oppenheimer said. The firm reiterated an outperform rating on the stock and $175 price target.

Bull of the Day: D-Wave Quantum (QBTS),1747819200000,"D-Wave Quantum QBTS shares soared over 25% on Tuesday after the company announced its next-generation Advantage quantum computing system.Featuring D-Wave's most advanced quantum processor to date, the Advantage2 system is commercial-grade, and built to address real-world use cases in areas such as optimization, materials simulation and artificial intelligence (AI).But the immediate breakthrough might be that customers will be able to access Advantage2 initially only through D-Wave's Leap cloud service. This marks the first instance of quantum-as-a-service.Quantum Completes the TriumvirateD-Wave CEO Alan Baratz emphasized in the company's Q1 earnings release two weeks ago that they ""became the first to demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computing on a useful real-world problem.""From the May 8 press release...Published the peer-reviewed paper “Beyond-Classical Computation in Quantum Simulation” in Science, validating D-Wave’s demonstration of quantum computational supremacy on a useful real-world problem. This research showed that D-Wave’s annealing quantum computer was able to perform a magnetic materials simulation in minutes that would take nearly one million years and more than the world’s electricity supply on one of today’s most powerful classical supercomputers, the Frontier massively parallel, GPU-based exascale supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This claim met resistance from some technology observers who debated the apples vs. oranges comparisons. But the accomplishments of D-Wave should not be so easily dismissed as there is definitely a ""there, there"" under the surface. As we learned from NVIDIA NVDA CEO Jensen Huang and other quantum experts recently at the first ever NVIDIA Quantum Summit in March, the world's most advanced computers will use a combination of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs, or quantum computing units.QPUs are not only very far from competing with GPUs, they will likely never replace them. And Jensen made sure everyone knew that when he graciously invited those leaders for a pow-wow, a month after completely dismissing the nascent industry.You can learn more about that exciting and controversial event in a podcast I did with Neena Mishra in March... Quantum Computing: Tech's Next Giant Leap?D-Wave's outspoken CEO Baratz sat next to Jensen and you could only cut the tension with a laser. But Baratz had already acknowledged that quantum systems will work in tandem with GPU-based AI, and he proved it with the company's first big sale in February.D-Wave made a big splash in the quantum computing space with their first sale of an Advantage annealing quantum computing system to a high-performance computing (HPC) center, the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), about 54 kilometers west of Cologne, Germany.As Europe’s first and only exascale HPC, the JSC JUPITER supercomputer will utilize D-Wave's Advantage system to facilitate breakthroughs in AI and quantum optimization applications.JUPITER is expected to surpass the threshold of one exaFLOP, or one quintillion floating point operations per second. This will be the world’s first coupling of an annealing quantum computer with an exascale supercomputer, providing a first-of-a-kind opportunity for tackling the world's toughest computational problems.Advantage2 Raises the BarThe Advantage2 system is expected to deliver significant performance gains and efficiency with doubled coherence, increased connectivity and a 40% boost to the energy scale for advanced problem solving.In addition to the Jülich Supercomputing Center, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has already been using prototypes of the new Advantage2 system to advance their research. A LANL engineer and Dale Moore, President and CEO of defense contractor Davidson Technologies, both were quoted in the press release regarding their enthusiasm for continued R&D.Davidson, located in Huntsville, Alabama is a trusted provider of advanced engineering and technical solutions supporting the U.S. Department of Defense, intelligence community, and aerospace industry. With a focus on mission-driven innovation, Davidson combines deep domain knowledge with emerging technologies to solve the nation’s most complex defense challenges.Ahead of this announcement, QBTS shares were already a Zacks #2 Rank because EPS estimates had moved significantly higher between the company's last two quarterly reports, with the full-year 2025 bottom line rising from a loss of 38-cents to only -$0.21.After the Q1 sale to JSC, D-Wave had bragging rights of a 500% jump in revenues on an admittedly small base. Before Tuesday's announcement, full-year 2025 sales were projected to cross $25 million, representing 183% growth.So it's fair to say that with a meteoric 125%+ gain in just 9 trading sessions, investors will be looking for increased sales and clarity on the expected delivery of physical Advantage2 systems -- or if margins will be better with the Leap cloud service.Large hyperscalers (think Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, and even Meta and Tesla) and other supercomputing research centers aiming to integrate quantum computing into their infrastructure will definitely want the Advantage2 system in a dedicated on-premise configuration.Qatar Goes Full QuantumAnother fortunate trade wind for D-Wave this past week may be the sizable investments and partnerships being lavished on a private competitor.Quantinuum, the private quantum-computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, finalized a $1 billion agreement with a Qatari investment firm last week. That number is spread over a decade, but it does show a commitment to the technology that has not been seen in the revenues of any of the companies yet.It was thought last year that Quantinuum might fetch a valuation as high as $10 billion if it IPOs this year. That estimate is probably higher now, and driving more investors to bet on the ponies already running on the public track, including Rigetti Computing RGTI and IonQ IONQ.Rigetti was a big winner for members of my TAZR Trader portfolio recently where we took gains of 1,340% and 703%. And IonQ has been of particular interest in my special report Beyond AI: The Quantum Leap in Computing Power because it utilizes the same technology approach as Quantinuum known as ""trapped ion"" computation.After Tuesday's rally in D-Wave shares, TAZR is sitting on open gains of over 1,600% in QBTS.Future's So Fast, You Gotta Wear a HelmetWriting for Barron's on May 15, Mackenzie Tatananni explained the ""ramping global demand"" for the technology.""Quantum computing is often seen as a speculative bet by investors and detractors could argue that its appearance alongside sectors like defense and energy was a surprise. However, the announcement was just another sign that enthusiasm for the technology continues to mount, both in the U.S. and abroad.""Quantinuum said its joint venture agreement with Al Rabban Capital would accelerate the adoption of quantum technology in Qatar and the surrounding region.The 10-year investment horizon includes training new developers and enabling access to Quantinuum's systems. As we've learned with NVIDIA, getting developers on-board and building in the platform ecosystem is key to further adoption across corporations and countries.The partners plan to develop regional-specific uses of quantum in fields such as finance, precision medicine, and genomics, both for academic and industrial clients.Bottom line: While the stock valuations of QBTS, RGTI, and IONQ may be ahead of their revenues, there is excitement among investors big and small, from Qatar to Queens, that QPUs will change the world as fast GPUs in the coming decade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ede8fd1e6094b:0-bull-of-the-day-d-wave-quantum-qbts/

OpenAI and Nvidia back $100B Stargate AI project in UAE,1747930110000,"The United Arab Emirates is set to become a central player in global artificial intelligence infrastructure as tech giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, and Cisco partner with Emirati firm G42 to build one of the largest AI campuses in the world. The Stargate UAE project, confirmed by the companies on Thursday, will be located in Abu Dhabi and marks the international expansion of a sweeping AI development programme launched earlier this year by the Trump administration. The site is expected to span 10 square miles and feature a 5-gigawatt capacity, with its first 200-megawatt AI cluster scheduled to go live in 2026.UAE project part of Trump-era $100B AI infrastructure dealThe Stargate UAE initiative stems from a joint infrastructure commitment announced in January by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The US-led plan initially pledged $100 billion in funding for domestic data centre projects and later expanded with an additional $500 billion earmarked for global efforts through 2029. The UAE campus will be the first major overseas project under this framework, directly supporting the administration’s strategy to build secure, decentralised AI infrastructure with allied nations.President Donald Trump, during his Middle East visit last week, unveiled a series of commercial AI deals, including the UAE venture.The collaboration aims to support not only US national AI resilience but also to offer trusted infrastructure to allied governments seeking advanced compute capacity.OpenAI and Oracle to manage 1 GW of computeUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Oracle will jointly operate a 1-gigawatt compute cluster, with G42 leading construction and deployment. Nvidia will supply high-performance AI chips, while Cisco is tasked with providing networking and connectivity solutions for the site. The firms said that the first phase will activate in 2026 with 200 megawatts of AI compute, which will be scaled up to full capacity in phases.OpenAI noted the partnership is part of its broader initiative to build AI facilities that promote responsible use while strengthening US-aligned digital infrastructure abroad. Oracle, which already has cloud operations in the region, is expected to integrate Stargate into its international cloud network, allowing the UAE campus to serve as a key node in global AI compute availability.UAE emerges as AI infrastructure hubThe Stargate UAE project positions the Gulf nation as a critical AI hub amid a broader push by the UAE government to diversify its economy and accelerate digital transformation. G42, which has partnered with OpenAI since 2023, is a major player in the UAE’s tech ecosystem, overseeing AI projects spanning healthcare, smart cities, and defence. The new campus will build on this foundation and contribute to local upskilling, energy innovation, and regional AI adoption.The partnership also aligns with Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment goals, allowing it to anchor AI infrastructure in the Middle East with support from US technology leaders. While the project highlights growing ties between US firms and the Gulf state, it also comes as global tech supply chains shift, particularly in data centre energy sourcing and chip availability.International rollout follows 16-state US expansion planIn February, OpenAI revealed it was evaluating sites in 16 US states to build similar data centre campuses as part of the original $100 billion initiative. The UAE project marks the first confirmed international site, although more are expected to follow as the programme expands.By combining sovereign funding with private sector leadership, the Stargate series of projects represents one of the largest coordinated AI infrastructure developments in history. It aims to provide compute access for startups, governments, and enterprises in a secure and geopolitically aligned manner, at a time when demand for AI power is rapidly outpacing current capacity.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:78195b5cf094b:0-openai-and-nvidia-back-100b-stargate-ai-project-in-uae/
Nvidia CEO praises Trump move to scrap some AI export curbs,1747793411000,"U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China were ""a failure"" as they have cost American companies billions of dollars in lost sales, Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on Wednesday.Huang's comments were levelled at the Biden administration's AI diffusion rule that sought to curb exports of sophisticated AI chips by dividing the world into three tiers, with China blocked entirely. The Trump administration has said it is going to modify the rules.""All in all, the export control was a failure,"" Huang said adding, ""The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, in the first place, have been proven to be fundamentally flawed.""The U.S. block on sales of advanced AI chips to China has forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers such as Huawei, while also spurring China to invest aggressively to develop a supply chain that doesn't rely on manufacturers outside the country.The Nvidia chief executive said that despite the U.S. controls, research continues, which requires vast sums of capital to acquire the necessary AI infrastructure.At a press conference at the annual Computex event in Taipei, Huang praised Trump's approach to AI and said by reversing the prior restrictions, the president demonstrated he understands U.S. companies are not the only providers of such technology.""President Trump realises it's exactly the wrong goal,"" he said in reference to the prior rules.From the start of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, Nvidia's China market share has dropped to 50% from 95%, Huang said.Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach to chip export curbs and replacing it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, which could give the U.S. clout in trade talks. 'INTENSE' COMPETITION IN CHINAMore than half the world's AI researchers are based in China and because of the U.S. export controls on AI chips those experts have been forced to turn to local Chinese technology, Huang said.""Our competition in China is really intense,"" Huang said. ""They would love for us never to go back to China.""Huang estimated the entire AI market in China would be worth roughly $50 billion next year, which represented a significant opportunity for the company.At the Computex event, Nvidia announced several new technologies and businesses that will expand its $130.5 billion revenue. The company said in April it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the Trump administration limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.Earlier this week, Huang estimated that the H20-related revenue damage would amount to roughly $15 billion.But Nvidia is working on a version of its current-generation Blackwell AI chip that will include a less speedy form of memory to comply with restrictions on the typical advanced memory included on AI chips, according to two sources familiar with the matter.In 2022, the Biden administration effectively banned exports of advanced microchips and equipment to produce advanced chips by Chinese chipmakers, part of an effort to hobble China's semiconductor industry and in turn the military.After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips such as H20 that would come as close as possible to U.S. limits.China on Monday urged the United States to ""immediately correct its wrongdoings"" and stop ""discriminatory"" measures following U.S. guidance warning companies not to use advanced computer chips from China, including Huawei's Ascend AI chips.The U.S. action seriously undermined consensus reached at the high-level bilateral trade talks in Geneva, a statement from China's commerce ministry said, vowing resolute measures if the U.S. continues to ""substantially"" harm China's interests.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT01X:0-nvidia-ceo-praises-trump-move-to-scrap-some-ai-export-curbs/"

These Are the Only 6 Stock Stocks in NVIDIA's 13F Portfolio,1747929420000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NVDA] Many investors closely watch 13F filings from institutional money managers. While chip giant NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA isn’t typically seen in that role, it must file as well, since it manages over $100 million in U.S.-traded securities.Below is a breakdown of the six stocks listed on  NVIDIA’s most recent 13F .Examining these holdings provides insight into the types of technology that this pioneering company is betting on.All return data calculates the change in price through the May 21 close, since NVIDIA revealed its initial stake in these companies, including their initial rise.NVIDIA’s Top 3 Chip and AI Infrastructure Investments Don’t Fall Far From the Tree [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] By far, NVIDIA’s largest 13F holding was CoreWeave NASDAQ:CRWV .CoreWeave accounted for 78% of NVIDIA’s total reported 13F holdings in Q1.Aside from owning approximately 7% of CoreWeave, the company is also one of NVIDIA’s biggest customers. CoreWeave uses its close relationship with NVIDIA to rent out the company’s most advanced AI chips to customers before anyone else.On its last earnings call, CoreWeave said it was the first to deploy NVIDIA’s GB200 Grace Blackwell systems at scale.Since going public in March, CoreWeave has increased by a staggering 169%, driven largely by the excitement surrounding its  NVIDIA relationship . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:ARM] The next two largest NVIDIA 13F holdings are Arm NASDAQ:ARM and Applied Digital NASDAQ:APLD .They represent around 10% and 4% of NVIDIA’s total $1.15 billion 13F portfolio . NVIDIA actually tried to fully acquire ARM in 2020 for $40 billion; however, the transaction fell through due to regulatory issues.ARM provides “IP cores,"" essentially the basic designs of chips that companies base their advanced chips on.As such, ARM is a very important but somewhat underappreciated player in semiconductors. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:APLD] Applied Digital is somewhat similar to CoreWeave, renting out computing power to customers.However, it still gets a good amount of its revenue from cryptocurrency miners , something that CoreWeave no longer dabbles in.The company is also tiny, comparatively, worth only around $1.5 billion.Since November 2024, when  NVIDIA first reported owning Applied Digital , the stock is down approximately 1%.AI-Drug Research, Computing, & Autonomous Driving Round Out NVIDIA’s 13F Portfolio [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:RXRX] NVIDIA’s fourth largest 13F holding is the clinical-stage drug company, Recursion Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ:RXRX .The company has no medicines approved by regulators yet, and thus doesn’t generate much revenue.Overall, the company’s free cash flow over the last 12 months was around -$400 million.The company is attempting to use AI to accelerate drug discovery and development.Importantly,  Recursion is an NVIDIA customer that uses the firm’s chips to power its supercomputer to achieve its mission.It is prioritizing work on four cancer treatments and two rare disease treatments.Even after jumping 24% the day NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February 2024, shares are down 51%. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NBIS] NVIDIA’s final two holdings are Nebius Group NASDAQ:NBIS and WeRide NASDAQ:WRD , each making up around 2% of its portfolio.Nebius’s business model is also very similar to CoreWeave’s, which is renting out AI computing power. Like CoreWeave, it is also seeing incredible revenue growth , reporting a 385% increase in sales in Q1.Nebius will be among the first companies that will offer NVIDIA’s new Blackwell Ultra AI factory platform.Despite rising 7% on the day the initial NVIDIA investment came out, investors have seen shares drop nearly 7% overall. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:WRD] Last up is WeRide. The company operates a variety of robotaxis and other autonomous driving vehicle platforms, primarily in China.WeRide uses NVIDIA’s advanced chips to operate its technology.Even including the 83% surge in shares after NVIDIA revealed its initial investment in February, they have fallen nearly 40% overall since then as of May 21.NVIDIA’s 13F Holdings: Prudent Examination Still Reigns SupremeThere is one clear common thread among all these companies in which NVIDIA is investing : they are either customers or suppliers of NVIDIA. This makes sense considering that NVIDIA would deeply understand their businesses.Overall, having investments from NVIDIA doesn't mean investors should blindly follow behind the tech giant and invest in these stocks.This is especially true as merely associating with NVIDIA can often drive wild up moves in these names, only to see their shares crater back to earth.Still, NVIDIA's investment is a positive, and directing a watchful eye toward these names makes sense.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:35d463924094b:0-these-are-the-only-6-stock-stocks-in-nvidia-s-13f-portfolio/
Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Sparks 'Jensanity' Frenzy in Taiwan During Computex Visit,1747778572000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) CEO Jensen Huang's return to Taiwan for the Computex trade show triggered massive public and media attention, with fans crowding events and officials responding to intense coverage.Revenue and valuation were not discussed in the report, but Nvidia's symbolic market presence loomed large during Huang's interactions with top executives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Local outlets dubbed the gathering the trillion dollar dinner, referencing the combined valuations of the companies in attendance.Fans shouted Huang's name, requested autographs, and received fried ice cream outside a Taipei restaurant. Nvidia capitalized on the popularity by launching a pop-up merchandise store featuring Huang-themed memorabilia.Security teams struggled to control the crowds, while Huang's U.S.-based peers expressed confusion at the celebrity status he commands in Taiwanespecially compared to his lower profile in the United States.Huang also made a high-profile appearance at the World Masters Games as a guest of honor alongside Olympic boxer Lin Yu-ting and actor Sylvia Chang. Political controversy briefly emerged after Taiwanese Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim's attendance was questioned as opportunistic. Her office denied prior knowledge of Huang's involvement.Following speculation in local media, Taiwan's transport ministry clarified that the cost to park Huang's private Bombardier jet at Songshan airport for six days was T$95,562 ($3,167).

"Nvidia Outlook in Focus Amid China Headwinds, Wedbush Says",1747927541000,"Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA ability to grow sales to offset the loss of H20 chip sales to China will be in focus when the company releases its Q1 results on May 28, Wedbush said in a report Thursday. ""The primary question around results and guidance is can NVDA lift sales enough to offset the loss of H20/China business,"" Wedbush analysts said. They said H20 demand was running ahead of expectations into early April when the US announced a ban on sales into China. They also said Blackwell, if anything, has ramped better than anticipated following some initial stumbles. ""We remain comfortable with our CQ1 and consensus estimates at $43B,"" the analysts said, adding that they were less certain about Q2 amid the loss of China sales. ""We also believe NVDA's Q2 revenue outlook matters less, as investors become more confident around NVDA's intermediate term growth outlook following recent announcements around planned AI data center investments,"" they said.

Foxconn to Build 100 MW AI Data Center With Nvidia (NVDA),1747778361000,"Foxconn said Tuesday it will develop a 100-megawatt AI data center with Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), with construction starting in phases across Taiwan. The project was announced during the Computex 2025 trade show in Taipei.The initial phase will begin with 20 MW of power in Kaohsiung, expanding to other locations based on local power capacity. Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said the rollout will be gradual due to Taiwan's constrained energy resources. We know that power is a very critical resource in Taiwan, Liu said.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the project as an AI factory meant for use by Foxconn, Nvidia, and Taiwan's entire tech ecosystem. He noted Nvidia has over 350 local partners who will benefit from the infrastructure.The initiative is also backed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC, 2330.TW, Financials) and the Taiwanese government. The move comes amid rising global competition in AI and semiconductor infrastructure, positioning Taiwan to play a central role in next-gen compute capacity.Investors will be watching for updates on construction timelines, power allocation strategies, and downstream AI applications tied to the center's output.- Track NVDA financials. - See NVDA insider trades.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1bbecf51e094b:0-foxconn-to-build-100-mw-ai-data-center-with-nvidia-nvda/
3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Hits All-Time High,1747927320000,"The cryptocurrency rally, which resumed late last month, is fast gathering pace, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new high on Thursday morning. Bitcoin surpassed $111,000 for the first time to hit a new all-time high. Interestingly, the jump in Bitcoin came despite the broader market ending lower on Wednesday.Bitcoin had a robust 2024. Experts predicted that the cryptocurrency has the potential to surpass $140,000 once global tensions ease. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by easing global tensions and hopes of the Federal Reserve resuming rate cuts later this year.Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-focused stocks. We have selected three stocks, namely Visa Inc. V, PayPal Holdings PYPL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 90 days.Bitcoin Hits All-Time HighBitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,886.41 on Thursday morning before paring some of the gain. However, it was still hovering around $110,950 and was on track to make further gains. The ongoing Bitcoin rally is being driven by a mix of positive news, including easing trade tensions, optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation and upbeat sentiment among institutional buyers.Bitcoin’s rally followed the U.S. equity market’s slump on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking a massive hit. The reason behind the diverging movement between cryptocurrencies and equities could be that investors are looking for alternative stores of value.Also, trade tensions have eased substantially over the past couple of weeks after the United States and China announced a trade truce and paused tariffs temporarily for 90 days. The United States also announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom earlier this month, while the White House said trade talks with several other nations are ongoing.Besides, there have been some encouraging regulatory developments for the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act — a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — passed a crucial procedural vote in the Senate recently. Also, President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto advisor, David Sacks, have been rallying for a pro-crypto agenda, which has been boosting the broader crypto market.3 Crypto-Centric Stocks With UpsideVisa Inc.Visa is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement.

Nvidia (NVDA) Ends Hopper AI Chip Line for China Amid U.S. Export Curbs,1747777272000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) is ending its Hopper AI chip series in China, with CEO Jensen Huang confirming the company will no longer modify the architecture to comply with U.S. export limits. A new downgraded chip is in the works as Nvidia seeks to retain footing in a critical growth market.Revenue from China totaled $17 billion in the fiscal year ending January 26, 2025, representing 13% of Nvidia's total sales. The H20 chip was the only remaining product in the Hopper series legally permitted for export to China under U.S. rules.Huang confirmed in a livestream that no further Hopper updates are possible, stating, It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore, according to Taiwan's Formosa TV.The company is expected to release a downgraded H20 chip within two months, according to earlier reports from Reuters, to help regain lost market share from competitors like Huawei.The Biden administration's Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, issued in January 2025, imposed new export restrictions, which have been criticized by Huang. He argued that the U.S. should focus on maximizing the global reach of its technologies rather than restricting exports.President Donald Trump has pledged to revoke those rules, calling them counterproductive to U.S. interests in global tech leadership.Huang visited China shortly after the H20 restrictions took effect, signaling Nvidia's ongoing commitment to the region despite tightened rules.- See insider trades for NVDA - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6ef65823d094b:0-nvidia-nvda-ends-hopper-ai-chip-line-for-china-amid-u-s-export-curbs/

"These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Moderna, Home Depot, Tesla, CATL, Nvidia, D-Wave Quantum, Viking Holdings, and More — Barrons.com",1747772880000,"By Joe Woelfel, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Connor SmithStocks fell Tuesday, as the S&P 500 snapped its six-day winning streak in a slow day for the market.These stocks were making moves:Moderna rose 6.1%. The Food and Drug Administration will stick to its existing process for updating Covid-19 shots for older adults and those at a high risk of severe illness. It's a softer approach than Trump officials had seemed poised to take, according to Barron's reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis.Home Depot, the biggest home-improvement retailer, reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.56 a share, missing analysts' estimates of $3.60. Revenue of $39.9 billion beat forecasts of $39.3 billion. The company said it plans to keep prices unchanged despite new tariffs. Home Depot shares were down 0.6%. Competitor Lowe's, which reports quarterly earnings Wednesday, fell 1.4%.Tesla was up 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk told a conference in Qatar that he expects to still be chief executive in five years, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla shares have declined 15% this year but have jumped about 44% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 22. Tesla sold 11,150 cars in China the past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung, up from 3,040 sold the week before. But that is down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Shares of Tesla supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology, the Chinese battery giant, soared 16% in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday. CATL raised almost $4.6 billion in the world's largest equity offering this year.UnitedHealth gained 1.8%. The shares rose 8.2% on Monday, ending the session at $315.89. It was the stock's largest daily percentage increase since Nov 4, 2020, when it rose more than 10%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock declined 23.3% last week after UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty resigned and the company suspended its 2025 outlook.Nvidia fell 0.9%. CEO Jensen Huang said Monday the company would be opening its artificial-intelligence server platform to rival chip makers but he also warned the U.S. government's move to limit chip exports to China could hit revenue by $15 billion.D-Wave Quantum jumped 26% as its sixth-generation quantum-computing system became available over the cloud. D-Wave management highlighted the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines effectively can handle.Amer Sports rose 19% after the sporting goods and apparel company topped first-quarter adjusted earnings estimates and raised fiscal-year profit guidance.Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained 1.5% to $17.72 after analysts at Evercore ISI upgraded shares of the technology company to Outperform from In Line and raised their price target to $22 from $17.Viking Holdings, the expedition cruises company, reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss on a revenue jump of 25% to $897.1 million. The company said it was seeing ""sustained strength in demand."" Shares, however, declined 5% as analysts questioned whether Viking will be able to sustain pricing growth as the year progresses.

President Trump's SALT Bill in Focus,1747926000000,"Well, all week we had been looking for a market catalyst, with economic prints scarce and Q1 earnings season winding down. We finally got it yesterday, with news that the “big, beautiful bill” was about to pass the House — that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk’s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending.However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1. This is before the Senate has gotten its hooks into the bill, and we know changes are going to be made. It has also gotten the attention of the bond market, which is now up over +4.6% on the 10-year, +4.0% on the 2-year and above +5.0% on the 30-year.The 20-year bond option yesterday triggered the mid-day sell-off. Major indexes fell from -1.4% (Nasdaq) to -1.9% (Dow) by yesterday’s close. This morning, we sank temporarily but are climbing at this hour: -120 points on the Dow, -5 on the S&P 500 and +15 points on the Nasdaq. The small-cap Russell 2000, which dropped -2.6% yesterday, is down another -10 points currently.Weekly Jobless Claims Stay In-RangeThankfully, this morning we do have economic reports to parse. Among them, like every normal Thursday, we see Initial Jobless Claims remaining in the groove with a healthy labor environment, at 227K — 2000 lower than the unrevised 229K reported for the previous week. Every several weeks or so we tend to see a pop above 240K, but always come back down in the subsequent prints.Continuing Claims came in at 1.903 million — above the psychological threshold of 1.9 million, but which has been revised down below it in all but one week of 2025 so far. This follows a downwardly revised 1.87 million from the prior week (these longer-term claims are reported a week behind initial claims). With aging workers taking their pink slips as a sign to call it a career, along with ex-federal employees currently living on severance packages, the long-awaited pressure on the labor market has been mild at worst to this point.Earnings Reports Ahead of Today’s Open: RL, BJThe parade of retailers reporting quarterly earnings continues this morning, with upscale retailer Ralph Lauren RL outpacing fiscal Q4 earnings estimates by 3 cents to $2.03 per share, on $1.70 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $1.63 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares are up modestly on the news, adding to the stock’s +18% gains year to date.Down the tax bracket a bit, BJ’s Wholesale BJ put up mixed numbers in its Q1 earnings report this morning. Earnings of $1.14 per share amounted to a nice beat on the bottom line, above the 91 cents analysts were expecting. Revenues, on the other hand, came in -0.5% from expectations to $5.15 billion. But reaffirming forward guidance has kept the stock up +2% this morning, adding to its +31% gains year to date.What to Expect in the Stock Market TodayAfter the opening bell, we’ll see S&P flash PMI for both Services and Manufacturing for the month of May. While both are expected to tick down a tad, Services is expected to remain above the 50-threshold (between growth and loss) and Manufacturing is anticipated to dip back below it.Existing Home Sales for April are expected to come in somewhat stronger: 4.13 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units versus 4.02 million posted a month ago. We have seen more homes come on line for sale of late, but off a very scarce base overall. New Home Sales, which come out tomorrow, are expected to slide back a bit.Also, earnings continues the final leg of its tour for the quarter, with Workday WDAY, AutoDesk ADSK and Deckers Outdoor DECK coming out with results after today’s close.

German chipmaker Infineon to work with Nvidia on power delivery chips ,1747767578000,"German chipmaker Infineon XETR:IFX said on Tuesday it will work with Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA on developing chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centers.Infineon said it will work with Nvidia to develop high-voltage, direct current power delivery systems. In current data centers, most high-voltage power is distributed as alternating current and then converted to the direct current needed by computer chips by individual power supply units inside of servers. But that method of distributing power introduces losses in moving power around and converting it. With each server rack within AI data centers expected to take a megawatt of power by the end of the decade, Infineon and Nvidia said they are hoping to reduce those losses by creating a centralized direct-current distribution system. “Through this innovative approach, Nvidia is able to optimize the energy consumption of our advanced AI infrastructure, which supports our commitment to sustainability while also delivering the performance and scalability required for the next generation of AI workloads,” Gabriele Gorla, vice president of system engineering at Nvidia, said in a statement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RS0Q4:0-german-chipmaker-infineon-to-work-with-nvidia-on-power-delivery-chips/"

Pre-Markets Even Out as Investors Digest Tax Bill,1747924140000,"Thursday, May 22, 2025Well, all week we had been looking for a market catalyst, with economic prints scarce and Q1 earnings season winding down. We finally got it yesterday, with news that the “big, beautiful bill” was about to pass the House — that which would extend the major tax cuts due to expire, among other things. It was what President Trump got elected on, after all, with Elon Musk’s DOGE project designed to cut waste in federal spending.However, this bill is currently projected to add $3.1 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, which has riled credit agencies that wasted little time downgrading U.S. credit from AAA to AA1. This is before the Senate has gotten its hooks into the bill, and we know changes are going to be made. It has also gotten the attention of the bond market, which is now up over +4.6% on the 10-year, +4.0% on the 2-year and above +5.0% on the 30-year.The 20-year bond option yesterday triggered the mid-day sell-off. Major indexes fell from -1.4% (Nasdaq) to -1.9% (Dow) by yesterday’s close. This morning, we sank temporarily but are climbing at this hour: -120 points on the Dow, -5 on the S&P 500 and +15 points on the Nasdaq. The small-cap Russell 2000, which dropped -2.6% yesterday, is down another -10 points currently.Weekly Jobless Claims Stay In-RangeThankfully, this morning we do have economic reports to parse. Among them, like every normal Thursday, we see Initial Jobless Claims remaining in the groove with a healthy labor environment, at 227K — 2000 lower than the unrevised 229K reported for the previous week. Every several weeks or so we tend to see a pop above 240K, but always come back down in the subsequent prints.Continuing Claims came in at 1.903 million — above the psychological threshold of 1.9 million, but which has been revised down below it in all but one week of 2025 so far. This follows a downwardly revised 1.87 million from the prior week (these longer-term claims are reported a week behind initial claims). With aging workers taking their pink slips as a sign to call it a career, along with ex-federal employees currently living on severance packages, the long-awaited pressure on the labor market has been mild at worst to this point.Earnings Reports Ahead of Today’s Open: RL, BJThe parade of retailers reporting quarterly earnings continues this morning, with upscale retailer Ralph Lauren RL outpacing fiscal Q4 earnings estimates by 3 cents to $2.03 per share, on $1.70 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $1.63 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares are up modestly on the news, adding to the stock’s +18% gains year to date. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Down the tax bracket a bit, BJ’s Wholesale BJ put up mixed numbers in its Q1 earnings report this morning. Earnings of $1.14 per share amounted to a nice beat on the bottom line, above the 91 cents analysts were expecting. Revenues, on the other hand, came in -0.5% from expectations to $5.15 billion. But reaffirming forward guidance has kept the stock up +2% this morning, adding to its +31% gains year to date. For more on BJ’s earnings, click here.What to Expect in the Stock Market TodayAfter the opening bell, we’ll see S&P flash PMI for both Services and Manufacturing for the month of May. While both are expected to tick down a tad, Services is expected to remain above the 50-threshold (between growth and loss) and Manufacturing is anticipated to dip back below it.Existing Home Sales for April are expected to come in somewhat stronger: 4.13 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units versus 4.02 million posted a month ago. We have seen more homes come on line for sale of late, but off a very scarce base overall. New Home Sales, which come out tomorrow, are expected to slide back a bit.Also, earnings continues the final leg of its tour for the quarter, with Workday WDAY, AutoDesk ADSK and Deckers Outdoor DECK coming out with results after today’s close. Calendar Q1 earnings season has not been exactly stellar, but far from the bleak levels many analysts had been expecting — especially on guidance. Earnings season unofficially ends next week, when NVIDIA NVDA reports.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics ,1747763100000,"Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we’ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the “World’s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.”As this trend gains traction, it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we’ll explore four stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), the Global X Robotics & AI ETF (BOTZ) and Tesla (TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolutionGrowth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it’s a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world’s most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla’s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia ,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia’s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank’s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don’t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfd373905094b:0-the-next-major-tech-stock-trend-humanoid-robotics/

"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.""We see Nvidia's leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,"" the analysts said.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Kraken launches tokens to offer 24/7 trading of U.S. equities,1747923186000,"Crypto exchange Kraken said on Thursday it is launching tokens of U.S. equities that will trade around the clock, giving non-U.S. investors exposure to high-profile companies such as Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA .Tokenization refers to the process of issuing digital representations of publicly-traded securities. Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities.The tokens' launch outside the U.S. comes amid growing interest in blending traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. While tokenized securities have yet to gain widespread adoption, proponents say they hold the potential to significantly reshape how people access and invest in financial markets.In a January opinion piece for the Washington Post, Robinhood NASDAQ:HOOD CEO Vlad Tenev said tokenization could also allow retail investors to access private companies' stocks. Kraken's tokens, called xStocks, will be available in select markets outside the United States, it said, without naming the markets. The move was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.The offering is currently not available for U.S. customers.The renewed enthusiasm for blockchain has also coincided with bitcoin's BITSTAMP:BTCUSD rally as investors anticipate lighter regulation under President Donald Trump.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU156:0-kraken-launches-tokens-to-offer-24-7-trading-of-u-s-equities/"

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/
'Stargate UAE' AI datacenter to begin operation in 2026,1747922400000,"The first phase of a massive new artificial data center in the United Arab Emirates will come online in 2026, likely with 100,000 Nvidia chips.The ""Stargate UAE"" project is part of a deal brokered last week by U.S. President Donald Trump to build the world's largest set of AI data centers outside the United States, despite previous U.S. restrictions on sending advanced technology to the UAE because of its close ties to China.The 10-square-mile (26-sq-km) site in Abu Dhabi will eventually host 5 gigawatts worth of data centers.The first phase of that project will be the 1-gigawatt Stargate UAE project, built by state-backed UAE firm G42 in partnership with U.S. firms OpenAI, Oracle NYSE:ORCL , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Cisco Systems NASDAQ:CSCO , as well as Japan's SoftBank Group TSE:9984 . The companies on Thursday said that the Stargate UAE project will use Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, currently the most advanced AI server that Nvidia offers.The first 200 megawatts of capacity will go live in 2026, the companies said. The group did not give a number of servers, but analyst firm TrendForce estimates that GB300 servers with 72 chips each consume about 140-kilowatts of power, which equates to about 1,400 servers or 100,000 Nvidia chips.This first-in-the-world platform will enable every UAE government agency and commercial institution to connect their data to the world's most advanced AI models,"" Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief technology officer and chairman, said in a statement.The Trump administration earlier this month rescinded a rule put in place by President Joe Biden that would have restricted the flow of AI chips to countries such as the UAE. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has not said what will replace the rule but said last week that it will convene a working group between the U.S. and UAE to ensure that the project meets ""robust U.S. security standards and other efforts to responsibly deploy AI infrastructure, both in the UAE and globally.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RT0Y9:0-stargate-uae-ai-datacenter-to-begin-operation-in-2026/"
