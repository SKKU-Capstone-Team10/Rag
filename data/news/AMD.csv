Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

"AMD Sells ZT Fab Unit, Bolsters AI Talent to Challenge Nvidia",1747769807000,"AMD NASDAQ:AMD offloads ZT Systems' manufacturing arm for $3 billion while snapping up its 1,200-strong engineering team to sharpen its edge against Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA in the data-center GPU race. Citi Research analysts, led by Christopher Danely, note that last August's $4.6 billion ZT deal has been split: Sanmina will acquire the factory business for $2.55 billion in cash and stock plus $450 million in earn-outs, while AMD retains the engineers for roughly $1.6 billionabout $1.33 million apieceto accelerate hyperscaler deployments and bolster system-level expertise. Danely argues that additional system experience and faster deployment times should help AMD close the gap on Nvidia's market share.Under the agreement, Sanmina becomes AMD's preferred manufacturing partner for cloud-rack and cluster-scale AI solutions, reflecting a strategic pivot from in-house production to a fab-lite model. The transaction, expected to close near year-end 2025, underscores AMD's focus on high-margin chip design over capital-intensive fabs. Citi kept its Neutral rating and $100 price target on AMD, highlighting the balance between near-term dilution from the $1.6 billion engineering buyout and long-term gains from faster product rollouts.AMD, which derives roughly 30% of sales from PCs, faces stiff competition not only from Nvidia in AI GPUs but also from Intel NASDAQ:INTC in data-center CPUs. By beefing up its in-house design team and offloading manufacturing risk, AMD aims to streamline R&D investment and speed time to market for MI300 and future MI400 data-center accelerators.Why It Matters: Retaining ZT's engineering talent while outsourcing production could deliver faster hyperscaler deployments and help AMD narrow the performance and deployment gap with Nvidia's entrenched data-center GPU ecosystem.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1cbb17f0e094b:0-amd-sells-zt-fab-unit-bolsters-ai-talent-to-challenge-nvidia/

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"

Qualcomm to make data center processors that connect to Nvidia chips,1747634400000,"Qualcomm on Monday said it will make custom data center central processing units, or CPUs, that use technology from Nvidia to connect to Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.Nvidia's chips are dominant in the AI market but always paired with CPUs, a market traditionally dominated by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia has jumped into the CPU market itself, designing a chip using technology from Arm Holdings to develop its own ""Grace"" CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said it would return to the data center CPU market. In the 2010s, Qualcomm began developing an Arm-based CPU that it tested with Meta Platforms, but curtailed those efforts amid cost cuts and legal challenges.But after acquiring a team of ex-Apple chip designers in 2021, Qualcomm has quietly revived those efforts, again holding discussions with Meta about a data center CPU. Qualcomm last week confirmed that it has a letter of understanding with Saudi Arabian AI firm Humain to develop a custom data center CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said that its future chips would use technology from Nvidia that will help them communicate quickly with Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs), which are the mainstay of its AI chip portfolio.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack-scale architecture, we're advancing a shared vision of high-performance energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Cristiano Amon said on Monday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RP001:0-qualcomm-to-make-data-center-processors-that-connect-to-nvidia-chips/"
Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

"AMD Rises 31% in One Month: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock?",1747405800000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have soared 31.4% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 19.4% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 22.5%.The outperformance can be attributed to AMD’s expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base. The strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success.So, how should you play the AMD stock now? Let’s dig deep to find out.AMD's One Month PerformanceAMD’s Expanding Portfolio Aids ProspectAMD’s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. In April 2025, AMD announced that Alphabet's GOOGL cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, has introduced new C4D and H4D virtual machines powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. Alphabet’s Google Cloud’s C4D instances deliver up to 80% higher throughput per vCPU, while Google Cloud’s H4D VMs offer scalable performance for HPC workloads with Cloud RDMA. These advancements underscore Google Cloud’s commitment to leveraging AMD’s Zen 5 architecture for enhanced cloud computing capabilities.AMD’s expanding portfolio in the embedded market has been a key catalyst for growth. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD introduced the EPYC Embedded 9005 Series processors, offering server-grade performance and energy efficiency, along with purpose-built features tailored for the networking, storage, and industrial edge markets.Rich Partner Base & Acquisitions to Boost AMD’s ProspectsA rich partner base that includes Alphabet, Oracle ORCL, Meta Platforms, Dell Technologies, Cisco Systems, Jio Platforms, Nokia and IBM has been playing a key part in expanding AMD’s footprint.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud, expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. AMD announced that its 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors now power Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute E6 Standard shapes. Oracle utilizes these processors to deliver up to 2X the performance of the previous generation at the same cost.AMD expanded its partnership with Dell Technologies to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure. In the reported quarter, AMD announced its collaboration with Dell Technologies to deliver AI-ready solutions for the telecom industry, featuring the Instinct MI300X accelerator to power scalable, high-performance network infrastructures.AMD is also benefiting from accretive acquisitions to strengthen its AI ecosystem and bridge the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the race for AI dominance. Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveDespite an expanding portfolio and a rich partner base, AMD is expected to be hurt by export restrictions on GPUs to China, which will be a headwind and stiff competition from NVIDIA.AMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%. AMD expects approximately $700 million reduction in second-quarter 2025 revenues due to halted MI308X shipments to China.AMD’s Earnings Estimates Trend DownwardThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s second-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, which has decreased 35% over the past 30 days, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.80%.The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $7.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.99%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.30%.AMD Stock OvervaluedAMD stock is currently overvalued, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.The stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.53X compared with the industry’s 3.31X.Price/Sales (F12M)Conclusion: Hold AMD Stock for NowAMD’s expanding portfolio, strategic acquisitions and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth. However, its near-term prospects are dull due to macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA in the cloud data center and AI chip markets. The growing demand for custom AI chips, offered by companies like Broadcom, is increasing concerns over market share. Stretched valuation also remains a concern. AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA, Bank of America, Microsoft and Oracle",1747392000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL.Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million.NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China.Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years.Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA?Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products.Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips.While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price.This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock.However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Wistron says new US plants will be ready for Nvidia's server production next year,1747379233000,"Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Wistron TWSE:3231 said on Friday that its new U.S. manufacturing facilities for its customer Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA would be ready next year and the firm was in talks with potential other customers.Part of the facilities will be used by Nvidia to support its plan to build artificial intelligence servers worth up to $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.The U.S. firm said in April it planned to build supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, partnering with Foxconn TWSE:2317 in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Both sites are expected to increase production within 12 to 15 months.""I believe it’s exactly in line with what the customer announced. All our progress will follow the customer’s lead,” Wistron CEO Jeff Lin said in his first public comments since Nvidia's announcement.He said the company was in discussion with other customers to use the U.S. facilities, which will produce high-performance computing and AI-related products, declining to disclose their names.Wistron’s board approved a total investment of $500 million in its new U.S. subsidiary to support business development and strategic growth in the U.S.Commenting on U.S. restrictions on exports of advanced chips to China, Lin said demand outside of China remained very strong.""We expect to grow alongside our customers ... As for developments in the Middle East, most of them are essentially our indirect customers.""The United Arab Emirates and the U.S. signed an agreement this week for the Gulf country to build the largest AI campus outside the U.S., in a deal that according to sources could involve purchase of 500,000 of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips per year starting in 2025. As the U.S. threatens sweeping tariffs on many of its trading partners, Wistron said it would also consider producing notebooks in Mexico, noting that such products would not face tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0A9:0-wistron-says-new-us-plants-will-be-ready-for-nvidia-s-server-production-next-year/"
"Markets Mostly Up on Mid-East Wheeling, Dealing",1747346880000,"Thursday, May 15, 2025Markets closed mostly up this session on moderately good news rippling through economic concerns throughout the day. With President Trump continuing his tour through the Middle East, we’re seeing a plethora of deals being made there with American corporations:Boeing BA will send more than 200 jets to Qatar Airways, $142 billion in military equipment investments will go to Saudi Arabia, billions more in Saudi infrastructure with supplies from AMD AMD, Cisco CSCO and others, and 18K AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA will be sent to a company chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.The Dow gained +271 points today, +0.65%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.52%. The Nasdaq, which has risen +13% over the past month, faltered this afternoon following news reports of an SEC investigation into Coinbase COIN and a cybersecurity hack, sending the stock down -7% today. Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks. But we we see Import and Export Prices ahead of the open, as well as Housing Starts and Building Permits — all for April. Earlier today, we saw a sagging Homebuilders Confidence survey for May, as high mortgage and home prices are remaining out of range for many prospective buyers, with many others feeling prices may be due to come down over the coming months. We’ll also see a new preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey for May on Friday, as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

AMD's $6B Buyback And $10B AI Deal: A $16B Gambit to Catch Nvidia,1747338227000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD is making moves. Recently, the chipmaker announced a fresh $6 billion stock buyback, pushing its total repurchase firepower to $10 billion. The goal? Shrink share count, boost EPS, and restore investor confidence. AMD's latest $10 billion AI collaboration with Humain is a bold swing, but questions linger on how quickly that bet can pay off.CEO Lisa Su says the repurchase signals strong belief in AMD's strategic direction and long-term cash flow. But Q1 free cash flow was down over 33%to $727 millionand cash on hand now trails current liabilities. That doesn't leave a huge margin for error. Add to that fierce competition from Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA AI dominance and a wave of custom chipmakers, and AMD's runway feels tight. Still, reducing the share count could help shore up EPSespecially if future earnings stabilize or rebound.The bigger picture? The long-term chart shows AMD's EPS without non-recurring items steadily trending up. Despite stock price swings, earnings performance has been resilient.If buybacks kick in and AI execution improves, the stock could catch up to the fundamentals. But make no mistakethis is now a show-me story.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:24958e80d094b:0-amd-s-6b-buyback-and-10b-ai-deal-a-16b-gambit-to-catch-nvidia/

Oracle Healthcare AI Advances: Should You Buy the Stock Now or Wait?,1747319460000,"Oracle ’s ORCL recent announcement of its Health Clinical AI Agent represents a significant advancement in its broader push to embed AI capabilities across its product portfolio. The company has unveiled a multimodal voice and screen-driven assistant that helps physicians reduce documentation time by approximately 30%, addressing the critical issue of clinician burnout in healthcare settings.AI Innovation Driving Healthcare TransformationOracle Health Clinical AI Agent combines generative AI, agentic technology, automation, and simplified workflows into a unified solution that integrates directly with Oracle's electronic health record systems. Already deployed across 40 medical specialties, the solution has facilitated the creation of nearly a million notes while enabling healthcare providers to access critical patient information through natural voice commands.The healthcare AI announcement aligns with statements made by Oracle CTO Larry Ellison during the recent third-quarter earnings call, where he highlighted the company's AI agent development. ""We have built lots of AI agents on top of Oracle databases and made those agents a part of our applications, modernizing and automating our applications,"" Ellison noted, specifically mentioning healthcare as a sector where Oracle's AI agents provide significant differentiation.Financial Performance Reveals Mixed SignalsOracle's third-quarter fiscal 2025 results showed both strengths and challenges. The company reported total revenues of $14.1 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year increase in USD and 8% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenues grew to $11 billion, up 12% in constant currency, while cloud infrastructure revenues increased 51%.Particularly impressive was Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which surged 63% year over year to $130 billion. CEO Safra Catz emphasized this metric as a leading indicator of future revenue growth, projecting a 15% increase in overall revenues for fiscal 2026 and approximately 20% for fiscal 2027.However, Oracle reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.47 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 0.68%. Revenues of $14.13 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%, disappointing investors’ enthusiasm for the company’s ascendant cloud business. The company's cloud license and on-premise license revenues declined 10% year over year (down 8% at cc) to $1.12 billion.Oracle trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 21.06x, substantially above the Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 16.6x. This premium valuation suggests that investors have already priced in exceptional future growth — growth that Oracle is increasingly struggling to deliver with modest revenue increases of just 6% year over year (8% in constant currency).ORCL’s EV/EBITDA TTM Ratio Depicts Premium ValuationThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.2% over the past 30 days.Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.Cloud Infrastructure Momentum Builds Against CompetitorsOracle's cloud infrastructure business has become a standout performer, with OCI consumption revenues increasing 57%. The company reached a milestone with its 101st cloud region coming online, positioning it to potentially surpass all competitors' combined cloud regions in the near future.The company has attracted major technology players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD, CrowdStrike CRWD and Palo Alto Networks PANW to its cloud platform, while also making significant inroads with hyperscalers through its Database@Cloud service offering, which grew 200% in the last quarter.However, during its latest earnings call, Oracle acknowledged that component delays have hampered cloud capacity expansion — a significant admission for a company positioning itself as a critical infrastructure provider for AI workloads. At a time when competitors like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google Cloud are rapidly scaling their infrastructure to meet surging AI demand, Oracle's supply chain challenges represent a competitive disadvantage that could cost it critical market share.With a 2.2% decline in the year-to-date period, ORCL has underperformed both the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500, which dropped 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively.Year-to-date PerformanceInvestment Outlook: Wait for a Better Entry PointDespite Oracle's impressive cloud growth and AI strategy, investors may want to exercise caution in the near term. The company currently trades at elevated valuation multiples relative to historical norms, while facing potential headwinds from component supply chain issues that have temporarily constrained cloud capacity expansion.While the backlog of $130 billion provides strong visibility into future growth, the company indicated that component delays have slowed cloud capacity expansion, potentially limiting near-term revenue conversion. Safra Catz noted that these constraints should ease in first-quarter fiscal 2026, which suggests that better growth acceleration may materialize later in 2025.Oracle's heavy capital expenditures, expected to exceed $16 billion for fiscal 2025, will pressure free cash flow in the immediate future. The trailing 12-month free cash flow of $5.8 billion represents a 53% year-over-year decline, primarily due to strategic infrastructure investments.Given these mixed signals, investors may find better entry points later in 2025 as cloud capacity constraints ease and the significant investments in AI infrastructure begin to generate stronger returns. The long-term thesis remains compelling, but patience could yield more attractive valuation opportunities for this cloud and AI transformation story. Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/
U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to address AI chip smuggling,1747314000000,"A bipartisan group of eight U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill on Thursday that would require makers of artificial intelligence chips such as Nvidia to include technology to verify the location of their chips before exporting them.The Chip Security Act introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to address reports of U.S. export-controlled AI chips being smuggled into China. U.S. officials across presidential administrations have sought to clamp down on their export to China, but Reuters and other news organizations have documented how some of those chips have continued to flow.""In order for the United States to maintain our technological advantage, we must employ safeguards to help ensure export controls are not being circumvented, allowing these advanced AI chips to fall into the hands of nefarious actors,"" Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who introduced the House bill, said in a statement.Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, introduced a similar bill in the U.S. Senate last week.The House bill was co-led by Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat, who was a physicist before becoming a legislator and designed several of his own chips during his scientific career. ""I know that we have the technical tools to prevent powerful AI technology from getting into the wrong hands,"" Foster said in a statement.The House bill comes after President Donald Trump's administration rescinded a rule enacted by predecessor President Joe Biden that would have regulated the flow of advanced AI chips around the world. The Trump administration has not yet announced a replacement rule.But Trump this week toured the Middle East, where he announced a spate of deals to send AI chips to countries in the Middle East, despite growing opposition from some inside the U.S. government. In addition to Foster and Huizenga, also co-leading the House bill are House Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat. Reps. Ted Lieu, California Democrat; Rick Crawford, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee; Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat; and Darin LaHood, an Illinois Republican were co-sponsors.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0Z7:0-u-s-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-address-ai-chip-smuggling/"

"US close to letting UAE import millions of Nvidia's AI chips, sources say",1747255290000,"The U.S. has a preliminary agreement with the United Arab Emirates to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA most advanced AI chips per year, starting in 2025, two sources familiar with the situation said, boosting the Emirates' construction of data centers vital to developing artificial intelligence models. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreement was at least through 2027, but that there was a chance it could be in place until 2030.The draft deal called for 20% of the chips, or 100,000 of them per year, to go to UAE's tech firm G42, while the rest would be split among U.S. companies with massive AI operations like Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Oracle NYSE:ORCL that might also seek to build data centers in the UAE, the sources said.They said the agreement is still being negotiated and could change before being finalized. One source said the deal, elements of which were first reported by the New York Times, faced growing opposition in the U.S. government over the past day. The Biden administration issued restrictions on AI chip exports to control the flow of the sophisticated processors worldwide, in part to keep the prized semiconductors from being diverted to China, where they could bolster Beijing's military.U.S. President Donald Trump this week is on a tour of the Gulf region and on Tuesday announced $600 billion worth of commitments from Saudi Arabia, including deals to buy large quantities of chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD and Qualcomm NASDAQ:QCOM . Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.The chips in the UAE deal that would go to G42 would represent a tripling or quadrupling, in terms of compute power, that would have been available to the UAE under rules put in place by the administration of former President Joe Biden. The Trump administration said last week it planned to rescind that regulation. At present, the vast majority of AI computing power is deployed in the United States and China. If all the proposed deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power center in global AI competition. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, did not have a comment. The White House, G42 and the United Arab Emirates did not have an immediate comment. Nvidia declined to comment.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, the UAE's ruling family and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42. The tech holding group's chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE national security adviser and brother of the Emirates' president.The preliminary agreement also aims to promote data centers in the U.S. It currently says that for every facility G42 builds in the UAE, it must build a similar one in the U.S., the sources said.One of the sources said the definition of what is an advanced AI chip would be figured out in a separate working group that will be created later, along with security requirements.The proposed numbers of chips are for the most advanced graphics processing units, one of the sources said. As of now, that could refer to Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are more powerful than the previous generation of Hopper chips, or Nvidia's forthcoming Rubin chips, which are more powerful than both of their predecessors.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM0V4:0-us-close-to-letting-uae-import-millions-of-nvidia-s-ai-chips-sources-say/"
Top Analysts Ride the AMD AI Wave Post $3 Billion ZT Systems Deal,1747829347000,"On Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD sold ZT Systems' manufacturing arm to Sanmina for $3 billion, retaining ZT's engineering team to support its AI infrastructure goals.Following the deal, Analysts have reshuffled their outlook. Stifel analyst Ruben Roy reaffirmed a Buy rating and raised his price objective to $132, about 16% above current levels. He argues that ZT's 1,200 engineers will accelerate development of AMD's rack-scale AI systems and that Sanmina's flexible manufacturing capabilities align well with cloud and AI deployments.Wells Fargo's Aaron Rakers also maintained a Buy rating, setting a $120 target, citing AMD's long-term AI potential. He highlighted the upcoming Instinct MI400-series GPUs and expects Sanmina to speed AI system rollouts for large-scale data-center customers.In contrast, Citi's Christopher Danely kept a Hold rating with a $100 objective. Danely focused on the $1.6 billion discount between AMD's $4.6 billion acquisition of ZT and the $3 billion sale price, noting the financial haircut but acknowledging the deal could still strengthen AMD's data-center GPU scaling.Overall, analysts view the ZT divestiture as a strategic move to sharpen AMD's focus on its core chip and AI businesses, though they differ on its immediate impact on valuation and earnings.Is AMD Stock a Buy?Based on the one year price targets offered by 41 analysts, the average target price for Advanced Micro Devices Inc is $128.44 with a high estimate of $200.00 and a low estimate of $75.00. The average target implies a upside of +13.15% from the current price of $113.51.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Advanced Micro Devices Inc in one year is $162.56, suggesting a upside of +43.21% from the current price of $113.51.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:3babf7208094b:0-top-analysts-ride-the-amd-ai-wave-post-3-billion-zt-systems-deal/

"AMD Sells ZT Fab Unit, Bolsters AI Talent to Challenge Nvidia",1747769807000,"AMD NASDAQ:AMD offloads ZT Systems' manufacturing arm for $3 billion while snapping up its 1,200-strong engineering team to sharpen its edge against Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA in the data-center GPU race. Citi Research analysts, led by Christopher Danely, note that last August's $4.6 billion ZT deal has been split: Sanmina will acquire the factory business for $2.55 billion in cash and stock plus $450 million in earn-outs, while AMD retains the engineers for roughly $1.6 billionabout $1.33 million apieceto accelerate hyperscaler deployments and bolster system-level expertise. Danely argues that additional system experience and faster deployment times should help AMD close the gap on Nvidia's market share.Under the agreement, Sanmina becomes AMD's preferred manufacturing partner for cloud-rack and cluster-scale AI solutions, reflecting a strategic pivot from in-house production to a fab-lite model. The transaction, expected to close near year-end 2025, underscores AMD's focus on high-margin chip design over capital-intensive fabs. Citi kept its Neutral rating and $100 price target on AMD, highlighting the balance between near-term dilution from the $1.6 billion engineering buyout and long-term gains from faster product rollouts.AMD, which derives roughly 30% of sales from PCs, faces stiff competition not only from Nvidia in AI GPUs but also from Intel NASDAQ:INTC in data-center CPUs. By beefing up its in-house design team and offloading manufacturing risk, AMD aims to streamline R&D investment and speed time to market for MI300 and future MI400 data-center accelerators.Why It Matters: Retaining ZT's engineering talent while outsourcing production could deliver faster hyperscaler deployments and help AMD narrow the performance and deployment gap with Nvidia's entrenched data-center GPU ecosystem.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1cbb17f0e094b:0-amd-sells-zt-fab-unit-bolsters-ai-talent-to-challenge-nvidia/

AMD vs. Lattice Semiconductor: Which FPGA Stock Has the Edge?,1747244100000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Lattice Semiconductor LSCC are major players in the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) market. AMD entered this space through its acquisition of Xilinx, while LSCC specializes in low-power FPGAs for applications like industrial automation and edge computing.Per the Mordor intelligence report, the FPGA Market size is projected to be valued at $11.14 billion in 2025. It is expected to reach $18.76 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 10.98% during the forecast period of 2025-2030. AMD and LSCC are likely to benefit from the significant growth opportunity highlighted by the rapid pace of growth.So, AMD or LSCC — Which of these FPGA stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.The Case for AMDAdvanced Micro Devices’ acquisition of Xilinx has helped expand into multiple embedded markets, which primarily include embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules and adaptive SoC products.The acquisition of Xilinx has helped AMD to consistently push the boundaries of capacity in emulation devices, with each generation nearly doubling its capabilities. The latest VP1902 adaptive SoC offers an impressive 18.5 million logic cells, doubling the programmable logic density of the previous generation Virtex UltraScale+ VU19P FPGA. AMD’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD announced the availability of a high-performance, energy-efficient 5G core powered by the Virtex UltraScale+ XCVU5P FPGA, developed in collaboration with Napatech and Druid Software.AMD also completed its initial shipments of cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale Plus FPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge SoCs during the first quarter, meeting the growing demand for AI at the Edge.AMD is also actively expanding its partnerships with major cloud providers, such as AWS, and incorporating its products into new FPGA-accelerated instances. In the first quarter of 2025, AWS launched FPGA-accelerated instances powered by AMD’s EPYC processors and Xilinx Virtex FPGAs. These instances are optimized for data-intensive workloads such as genomics, multimedia processing, and cloud-based video broadcasting.The Case for LSCCLattice Semiconductor is benefiting from strong demand for its small and mid-range FPGA solutions. The company has continued to expand its footprint in this market, particularly with its Nexus and Avant product families. This has enabled the company to capitalize on new opportunities in high-growth industries.Building on this momentum, Lattice has positioned its FPGAs in high-growth applications, including AI, data centers, and advanced driver-assistance systems in automotive, along with other emerging markets, such as security, including Post-Quantum Cryptography and AR/VR in consumer markets. Further strengthening its position in February 2025, the company announced the successful validation of Everspin Technologies' PERSYST Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) for use across all of Lattice’s Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).This collaboration aims to enhance MRAM’s suitability for mission-critical applications, including real-time sensor processing, data logging in avionics, and in-orbit reprogramming for space systems.Price Performance and Valuation of AMD and LSCCYear to date, shares of AMD and LSCC have lost 6.9% and 1.4%, respectively. The dip in AMD and LSCC share prices can be attributed to the challenging macroeconomic environment. A broader market weakness in the tech sector and persistent fear over mounting tariffs have added to the pressure. AMD and LSCC Stock's PerformanceValuation-wise, AMD and LSCC shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of D and F. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AMD shares are trading at 5.41X, which is lower than LSCC's 13.91X.AMD and LSCC ValuationHow Do Earnings Estimates Compare for AMD & LSCC?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.09 per share, which has declined 10% over the past 30 days, indicating a 23.56% increase year over year.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LSCC’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.05 per share, which has decreased 4.5% over the past 30 days, indicating a 16.67% increase year over year.Lattice Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusLattice Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | Lattice Semiconductor Corporation QuoteAMD earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 2.30%. LSCC earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and were in line with the other two, delivering a negative average earnings surprise of 6.31%.ConclusionAMD’s strong portfolio expansion and partnerships position it for robust growth in the FPGA market, while LSCC’s focus on low-power solutions continues to capture emerging opportunities. However, AMD’s valuation and earnings estimates suggest it may offer greater upside potential than LSCC.Currently, AMD has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick than LSCC, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:363c7b408094b:0-amd-vs-lattice-semiconductor-which-fpga-stock-has-the-edge/

AMD’s AI-Powered Stock Price Rally Just Shifted Gears,1747238700000,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ:AMD long-awaited AI-powered stock price rally is here. The stock is rocketing higher after a string of good news, including reduced trade tensions with China, a new deal with Saudi Arabia’s HUMAIN, and a new $6 billion share buyback authorization. The authorization, a sign of the board's confidence in future free cash flow , is worth an additional $6 billion on top of the $4 billion left under the existing. The total $10 billion in potential share repurchases is worth about 5.5% of the market cap in mid-May and a potentially strong tailwind. It is potentially strong because repurchase activity in 2024 failed to reduce the count, stock-based compensation awards more than offset their impact and may do so again in 2025. However, the first quarter results included a slight reduction in the diluted count that may persist and even accelerate as the year progresses.Other figures that investors should be watching are the cash, assets, and equity, which are all increasing. The company’s Q1 balance sheet highlights included a 50% YOY increase in cash , increased receivables and inventory , steady debt levels , and reduced liability . The net result was a 5% increase in equity and an expectation for equity gains to accelerate as the year progresses. The outlook for the year was amplified by recent news, including a $10 billion deal with HUMAIN. HUMAIN, Saudi Arabia’s newly formed AI enterprise, inked a $10 billion deal for AI infrastructure backed by President Trump. The deal involves 500 megawatts of AI compute capacity using AMD's most advanced semiconductor technology and is expected to play out over five years.The impact on AMD's outlook is significant and worth 3100 basis points of revenue growth relative to the 2025 consensus forecast reported by MarketBeat. Analysts Cheer Eye-Opening Moment for AI Investors The analyst's response to the Saudi news was overwhelmingly bullish. Bank of America analysts view Advanced Micro Devices as a top-winner alongside NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , while the Dan Ives-led Wedbush team called it an eye-opening moment . They view the deal and the others announced alongside it as a clear signal that Saudi Arabia will be a significant player in AI for years to come.Saudi Arabia's AI investment could top $1 trillion within years and open the door to expanding possibilities for all things AI. Ultimately, the factor that matters is that the analyst group is  lifting price targets again and leading to the high-end range, a gain of 50% relative to mid-May trading levels. Advanced Micro Devices' upcoming Q2 earnings release, scheduled for late July, will be a market-moving event for this stock. Not only is there a high probability that the company will outperform its consensus estimates for revenue and earnings, but the guidance will likely be strong .Demand was strong before the Saudi deal and will only increase in its wake. The risk is China. The curb on exports to China will impact the results, but may be limited. Saudi Arabia will make up for the lost revenue.Advanced Micro Devices Stock Price Reaches a Critical Pivot PointAdvanced Micro Devices' stock price advanced by 15% within two days of the HUMAIN announcement and will likely continue to move higher. However, there is a risk of resistance at a critical pivot point, including the long-term 30-week EMA, representing institutional buy-and-hold investors.If the market is unable to get above the level quickly, there is a risk that AMD’s share price will remain range-bound at current levels. A move above the 30-week EMA would be a bullish sign, indicating  improved market sentiment and an all-clear to investors . The market for AMD stock would likely move up to $147.50 soon after and potentially continue rising through the year’s end. Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:0f5677575094b:0-amd-s-ai-powered-stock-price-rally-just-shifted-gears/

AMD stock rallies on stock buyback announcement: find out more,1747234829000,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ:AMD is pushing significantly to the upside this morning after announcing a material increase to its share repurchase authorisation.On Wednesday, the company’s board authorised another $6 billion worth of buybacks, reflecting “confidence in AMD’s strategic direction, growth prospects and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow.”The chipmaker is now authorised to repurchase about $10 billion worth of its stock in total. AMD’s extended program “has no termination date,” as per its press release today.At the time of writing, AMD shares are up more than 50% versus their low in early April.Why is the buyback announcement significant for AMD stock?AMD choosing to expand its existing buyback program is a meaningful development for investors, given repurchases often suggest the management currently sees the stock as undervalued. Additionally, buybacks decrease the number of outstanding shares, which can trigger an increase in earnings per share. A higher EPS tends to attract investors and strengthen the company’s stock price.Share repurchase initiatives are positive also because they create buying pressure, helping stabilise a firm’s stock price during volatile markets. AMD stock has been in a sharp uptrend in recent weeks as the Trump administration continued to sign trade agreements with global leaders. Most recently, the White House even agreed to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China as well.Still, Advanced Micro Devices shares are down more than 8.0% versus their YTD high at writing.AMD has secured a sizable deal from Saudi ArabiaInvestors are cheering AMD stock also because the chipmaker has recently inked a multi-year AI infrastructure deal with Humain – a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.The said collaboration will “deploy up to 500 megawatts of AI infrastructure, powered by the full spectrum of AMD compute,” as per the multinational’s press release on Wednesday.The Saudi agreement made Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya raise his price target on Advanced Micro Devices in a research note this morning to $130.His upwardly revised price target on AMD shares represents potential upside of another 9.0% from here.Why is Bank of America bullish on AMD shares?BofA is positive on AMD stock as “Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investment with a focus on training and inference of LLMs in local culture, language, and needs.”Plus, it could help boost power availability for data centres in the US as well, BofA analyst Vivek Arya told clients in a research note on Wednesday.Note that the Kingdom, more broadly, has recently pledged up to $600 billion worth of investments in the US.That said, the AI stock remains unattractive for income investors since it does not currently pay a dividend.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:32e4c645e094b:0-amd-stock-rallies-on-stock-buyback-announcement-find-out-more/

SMCI Stock Jumps 15%. What's Behind Super Micro's Latest Surge. — Barrons.com,1747234620000,"By Mackenzie TatananniShares of Super Micro Computer extended gains on Wednesday following a flood of good news.The stock surged 15% to $44.57, putting it on pace for its highest close since Feb. 26, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.Super Micro's steep ascent began Tuesday after Raymond James analysts initiated coverage at Outperform with a $41 price target. The firm dubbed the server maker ""a market leader in AI-optimized infrastructure"" and lauded its ability to offer ""competitive pricing"" relative to peers.Also on Tuesday, Super Micro said it had shipped a number of high-density servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices' EPYC 4005 series processors, and separately announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt.The multi-year partnership is meant to accelerate the delivery of GPU platforms and rack systems for DataVolt's hyperscale campuses, the companies said.Shares received an additional boost along with the broader market after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. Super Micro ended Tuesday's session up 16% at $38.89.Regardless of the sharp gains, the stock remains down 53% from its 52-week high and off 62% from its record closing high of $118.81, which it notched in March 2024.Shares peaked at the end of February after the server maker narrowly avoided delisting from the Nasdaq by filing a string of delayed financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Despite the company's proclamation that the matter was ""closed,"" auditor BDO expressed an adverse opinion, stating that Super Micro ""did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.""An adverse opinion indicates that a company's financial statements are misrepresented or inaccurate. While months have passed since the debacle, Raymond James analysts argued that the company's ""reputational risk"" was dampening its valuation.The sudden increase in Super Micro's price, amounting to a 39% gain over the past three days, raises questions as to whether the stock is caught in a short squeeze.A short squeeze occurs when the price of a stock rises unexpectedly instead of falling, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares to diminish their losses. This collective buying can drive up a stock's price even further.As of May 2, 108.28 million shares were sold short, representing 21% of Super Micro's float. As a general rule of thumb, short interest between 10% and 20% is considered high, while any value exceeding 20% is extremely high.Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

AMD to sell ZT Systems' server-manufacturing business to Sanmina in $3 billion deal,1747655747000,"AMD will sell the server-manufacturing business of recently acquired ZT Systems to Sanmina in a $3 billion deal, making the U.S.-based contract manufacturer its partner for building AI hardware as the chip designer works to onshore supply chains.The deal, announced on Monday, highlights AMD's NASDAQ:AMD efforts to produce more of its chips on American soil amid global trade tensions and U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing.AMD shares were down 2.2%, while Sanmina NASDAQ:SANM fell more than 5%.""We expect to strengthen our U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities for rack and cluster-scale AI systems and accelerate quality and time-to-market for our cloud customers,"" said Forrest Norrod, executive vice president of AMD's data center solutions business unit.The company had said last month its key central processor chips would soon be made at TSMC's TWSE:2330 new production site in Arizona — marking the first time its products will be manufactured in the U.S.AMD had announced a $4.9 billion buyout of ZT Systems in 2024 and unveiled plans to sell its server manufacturing business once the transaction closes. The deal was completed in March.Under Monday's agreement, AMD will retain ZT's AI systems design business — a key asset amid escalating computing requirements that require mapping out thousands of chips strung together in clusters.ZT's design unit could be an important portfolio item for AMD, which has been struggling to compete against Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA in the booming market for AI processors.Sanmina will pay $2.25 billion in cash for ZT Systems' manufacturing business, along with a $300 million premium consisting of 50% cash and 50% equity.The deal, expected to close near the end of this year, also includes a $450 million contingent consideration based on the business' financial performance over the next three years.AMD is entitled to receive up to $153 million, if the deal is terminated.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RR0TQ:0-amd-to-sell-zt-systems-server-manufacturing-business-to-sanmina-in-3-billion-deal/"
AI chipmaker AMD unveils $6 billion buyback plan,1747228189000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD on Wednesday announced a new $6 billion stock buyback plan, joining a string of chipmakers that are looking to reduce their float as the AI trade that has powered their shares shows some signs of slowing. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company rose as much as 6.4%. Its shares have fallen more than 6% so far this year, compared with a less than 1% drop for the benchmark Philadelphia Semiconductor Index NASDAQ:SOX . The buyback, which boosts its total repurchase authority to about $10 billion, comes just a day after AMD announced a deal with Humain, saying it has formed a $10 billion collaboration, following in the footsteps of a number of U.S. technology firms that struck AI deals in the Middle East. While the chip sector at large has been pressured by fears around artificial intelligence-linked spending and the impact of a global trade war, AMD has still underperformed peers as concerns emerge around its competitiveness in the AI market. AMD has been lauded as the most formidable competitor to AI front-runner Nvidia's dominance, but the company now faces tough competition from custom processors and the larger rival's industry stronghold. AMD's shares fell 18% last year, while Nvidia shares rose above 170%. Custom AI chipmaker Broadcom's NASDAQ:AVGO shares doubled in value in 2024 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index had risen close to 20%. ""Our expanded share repurchase program reflects the Board's confidence in AMD's strategic direction, growth prospects, and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow,"" AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su said in a statement. However, AMD's free cash flow in the three months ended March fell more than 33% to $727 million. As of March 29, its cash and cash equivalents were $6.05 billion while current liabilities stood at $7.70 billion. Among other major chipmakers repurchasing their stock, Broadcom announced a $10 billion buyback in April, while smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm unveiled a $15 billion stock buyback in November.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RM16G:0-ai-chipmaker-amd-unveils-6-billion-buyback-plan/"

Qualcomm to make data center processors that connect to Nvidia chips,1747634400000,"Qualcomm on Monday said it will make custom data center central processing units, or CPUs, that use technology from Nvidia to connect to Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.Nvidia's chips are dominant in the AI market but always paired with CPUs, a market traditionally dominated by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia has jumped into the CPU market itself, designing a chip using technology from Arm Holdings to develop its own ""Grace"" CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said it would return to the data center CPU market. In the 2010s, Qualcomm began developing an Arm-based CPU that it tested with Meta Platforms, but curtailed those efforts amid cost cuts and legal challenges.But after acquiring a team of ex-Apple chip designers in 2021, Qualcomm has quietly revived those efforts, again holding discussions with Meta about a data center CPU. Qualcomm last week confirmed that it has a letter of understanding with Saudi Arabian AI firm Humain to develop a custom data center CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said that its future chips would use technology from Nvidia that will help them communicate quickly with Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs), which are the mainstay of its AI chip portfolio.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack-scale architecture, we're advancing a shared vision of high-performance energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Cristiano Amon said on Monday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RP001:0-qualcomm-to-make-data-center-processors-that-connect-to-nvidia-chips/"

Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

"AMD Rises 31% in One Month: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock?",1747405800000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have soared 31.4% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 19.4% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 22.5%.The outperformance can be attributed to AMD’s expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base. The strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success.So, how should you play the AMD stock now? Let’s dig deep to find out.AMD's One Month PerformanceAMD’s Expanding Portfolio Aids ProspectAMD’s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. In April 2025, AMD announced that Alphabet's GOOGL cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, has introduced new C4D and H4D virtual machines powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. Alphabet’s Google Cloud’s C4D instances deliver up to 80% higher throughput per vCPU, while Google Cloud’s H4D VMs offer scalable performance for HPC workloads with Cloud RDMA. These advancements underscore Google Cloud’s commitment to leveraging AMD’s Zen 5 architecture for enhanced cloud computing capabilities.AMD’s expanding portfolio in the embedded market has been a key catalyst for growth. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD introduced the EPYC Embedded 9005 Series processors, offering server-grade performance and energy efficiency, along with purpose-built features tailored for the networking, storage, and industrial edge markets.Rich Partner Base & Acquisitions to Boost AMD’s ProspectsA rich partner base that includes Alphabet, Oracle ORCL, Meta Platforms, Dell Technologies, Cisco Systems, Jio Platforms, Nokia and IBM has been playing a key part in expanding AMD’s footprint.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud, expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. AMD announced that its 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors now power Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute E6 Standard shapes. Oracle utilizes these processors to deliver up to 2X the performance of the previous generation at the same cost.AMD expanded its partnership with Dell Technologies to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure. In the reported quarter, AMD announced its collaboration with Dell Technologies to deliver AI-ready solutions for the telecom industry, featuring the Instinct MI300X accelerator to power scalable, high-performance network infrastructures.AMD is also benefiting from accretive acquisitions to strengthen its AI ecosystem and bridge the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the race for AI dominance. Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveDespite an expanding portfolio and a rich partner base, AMD is expected to be hurt by export restrictions on GPUs to China, which will be a headwind and stiff competition from NVIDIA.AMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%. AMD expects approximately $700 million reduction in second-quarter 2025 revenues due to halted MI308X shipments to China.AMD’s Earnings Estimates Trend DownwardThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s second-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, which has decreased 35% over the past 30 days, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.80%.The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $7.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.99%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.30%.AMD Stock OvervaluedAMD stock is currently overvalued, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.The stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.53X compared with the industry’s 3.31X.Price/Sales (F12M)Conclusion: Hold AMD Stock for NowAMD’s expanding portfolio, strategic acquisitions and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth. However, its near-term prospects are dull due to macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA in the cloud data center and AI chip markets. The growing demand for custom AI chips, offered by companies like Broadcom, is increasing concerns over market share.

Investors cheered, sending AMD shares up nearly 4% as they realized how much revenue could flow from building out that kind of GPU-heavy infrastructure.Lisa Su says the partnership advances global AI infrastructure by marrying AMD's open-architecture gear with HUMAIN's local ecosystem, while HUMAIN's CEO Tareq Amin calls it democratizing AI at the compute levelbasically putting next-gen performance in more hands. And this follows HUMAIN's own $5 billion AWS tie-up from earlier on Tuesday, showing Saudi Arabia's serious push to localize cloud and AI services.Why it matters: That $10 billion commitment bulks up AMD's data-center backlog and highlights how tech geopolitics are reshaping growth opportunities.Keep an eye on AMD's next earnings callinvestors will want to know how soon this deal starts padding the top line and what it means for profit margins as all that horsepower goes live.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:180962354094b:0-amd-jumps-on-10-billion-saudi-ai-partnership/

$10 Billion AI Shockwave: Saudi Arabia Taps AMD to Build a Global Tech Empire,1747204951000,"Saudi Arabia is going all-in on AIand it just roped in a major U.S. chipmaker to help lead the charge. The Kingdom's new AI investment vehicle, Humain, has announced a $10 billion commitment to build a global AI backbone, including hyperscale data centers, clean energy infrastructure, and fiber-optic connectivity from Riyadh to the U.S. AMD NASDAQ:AMD will be supplying chips and software for the rollout. While it's not yet confirmed whether AMD is putting capital into the deal or acting strictly as a vendor, the move could signal a broader pivot: courting sovereign-backed AI projects as an alternative to chasing the usual Big Tech crowd.AMD's CEO Lisa Su called the partnership a significant milestone, hinting at a globally scaled AI architecture that could rival existing setups in openness and reach. With Nvidia also set to contribute chips, Humain appears to be spreading its bets across the AI hardware spectrum. The announcement was made at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh, with former President Donald Trump presenta setting that speaks volumes about the geopolitical stakes behind the deal. For AMD, this could be a shot at gaining market share in a space where Nvidia has long ruled the accelerator roost.Meanwhile, sources suggest the U.S. government is finalizing a deal to give Saudi Arabia broader access to advanced semiconductors, even as it keeps China on a tighter leash. That could pave the way for more sovereign AI projects out of the Gulf, with U.S. chipmakersespecially those outside the Big Tech orbitwell-positioned to benefit. For investors, this isn't just a data center buildout. It's a potential rebalancing of global AI powerand a fresh demand engine for the semiconductor names fueling it.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:58a99b6c0094b:0-10-billion-ai-shockwave-saudi-arabia-taps-amd-to-build-a-global-tech-empire/

Humain Partners with U.S. Tech Companies to Build AI Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia — Update,1747156260000,"By Adriano Marchese and Connor HartHumain, the arm of Saudi Arabia's public investment fund focused on artificial intelligence, will partner with several U.S. tech companies to build out AI infrastructure in the country.The AI value-chain subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on Monday said it has formed strategic partnerships with Nvidia, Amazon.com and Advanced Micro Devices. Under these three collaborations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expects more than $15 billion of investments to contribute to the deployment of hundreds of megawatts of AI compute capacity over the coming years.Humain earlier in the day disclosed its partnership with chipmaking giant Nvidia, under which it planned to build AI factories in the country with a projected capacity of up to 500 megawatts, powered by hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's GPUs.The first phase of deployment would involve about 18,000 of Nvidia's supercomputers, the parties said.Later, in a separate release, Humain said it would work with Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, to invest more than $5 billion and build what it called an AI Zone. This zone is set to combine multiple AI capabilities and will allow Humain to develop AI solutions using AWS technologies for its end customers, it added.Amazon's recent investment follows a previously announced, separate $5.3 billion investment to build an AWS infrastructure region in Saudi Arabia that is set to become available next year.Humain will additionally partner with Advanced Micro Devices to build a network of AMD-based AI computing centers stretching from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. The parties will invest up to $10 billion to deploy 500 megawatts of AI computing capacity over the next five years.The AI superstructure built by AMD and Humain will be open by design, accessible at scale and optimized to power AI workloads across enterprise, start-up and sovereign markets, they said.Investors rallied behind the investments. In afternoon trading Tuesday, Nvidia's shares rose 5.8%, to $130.18; Amazon's shares climbed 2.4%, to $213.75; and AMD's shares gained 3.8%, to $112.27.Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com and Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250513008533:0-humain-partners-with-u-s-tech-companies-to-build-ai-infrastructure-in-saudi-arabia-update/

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL.Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million.NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China.Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years.Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA?Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products.Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips.While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price.This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock.However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks. But we we see Import and Export Prices ahead of the open, as well as Housing Starts and Building Permits — all for April. Earlier today, we saw a sagging Homebuilders Confidence survey for May, as high mortgage and home prices are remaining out of range for many prospective buyers, with many others feeling prices may be due to come down over the coming months. We’ll also see a new preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey for May on Friday, as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

The company’s first-quarter results benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that fully offset sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Data centers benefited from solid adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises.New product launches, such as the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D and Radeon 9070 series, also bolstered results. Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD’s expanding partner base including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro has been a key catalyst. It has also expanded its portfolio through acquisitions.However, AMD has been suffering from stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA. Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>> )Union Pacific’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-6.1% vs. -4.8%). The company is suffering as e-commerce sales have normalized and consumer markets have softened. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment. Reduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern.Due to these headwinds, volumes are suffering. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) remains under pressure, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist. To combat the revenue weakness, UNP is looking to cut costs. In the meantime, UNP continues paying dividends.UNP is also active on the buyback front. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. Our thesis is supported by the Neutral recommendation on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>> )Shares of Lowe's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (-1.6% vs. +4.6%).

AMD's $6B Buyback And $10B AI Deal: A $16B Gambit to Catch Nvidia,1747338227000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD is making moves. Recently, the chipmaker announced a fresh $6 billion stock buyback, pushing its total repurchase firepower to $10 billion. The goal? Shrink share count, boost EPS, and restore investor confidence. AMD's latest $10 billion AI collaboration with Humain is a bold swing, but questions linger on how quickly that bet can pay off.CEO Lisa Su says the repurchase signals strong belief in AMD's strategic direction and long-term cash flow. But Q1 free cash flow was down over 33%to $727 millionand cash on hand now trails current liabilities. That doesn't leave a huge margin for error. Add to that fierce competition from Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA AI dominance and a wave of custom chipmakers, and AMD's runway feels tight. Still, reducing the share count could help shore up EPSespecially if future earnings stabilize or rebound.The bigger picture? The long-term chart shows AMD's EPS without non-recurring items steadily trending up. Despite stock price swings, earnings performance has been resilient.If buybacks kick in and AI execution improves, the stock could catch up to the fundamentals. But make no mistakethis is now a show-me story.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:24958e80d094b:0-amd-s-6b-buyback-and-10b-ai-deal-a-16b-gambit-to-catch-nvidia/

"Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy? ",1747335600000,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze. Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIA Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corporation BAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA? Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corporation MSFT is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corporation ORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company reported total revenues of $14.1 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year increase in USD and 8% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenues grew to $11 billion, up 12% in constant currency, while cloud infrastructure revenues increased 51%.Particularly impressive was Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which surged 63% year over year to $130 billion. CEO Safra Catz emphasized this metric as a leading indicator of future revenue growth, projecting a 15% increase in overall revenues for fiscal 2026 and approximately 20% for fiscal 2027.However, Oracle reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.47 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 0.68%. Revenues of $14.13 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%, disappointing investors’ enthusiasm for the company’s ascendant cloud business. The company's cloud license and on-premise license revenues declined 10% year over year (down 8% at cc) to $1.12 billion.Oracle trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 21.06x, substantially above the Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 16.6x. This premium valuation suggests that investors have already priced in exceptional future growth — growth that Oracle is increasingly struggling to deliver with modest revenue increases of just 6% year over year (8% in constant currency).ORCL’s EV/EBITDA TTM Ratio Depicts Premium ValuationThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.2% over the past 30 days.Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.Cloud Infrastructure Momentum Builds Against CompetitorsOracle's cloud infrastructure business has become a standout performer, with OCI consumption revenues increasing 57%. The company reached a milestone with its 101st cloud region coming online, positioning it to potentially surpass all competitors' combined cloud regions in the near future.The company has attracted major technology players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD, CrowdStrike CRWD and Palo Alto Networks PANW to its cloud platform, while also making significant inroads with hyperscalers through its Database@Cloud service offering, which grew 200% in the last quarter.However, during its latest earnings call, Oracle acknowledged that component delays have hampered cloud capacity expansion — a significant admission for a company positioning itself as a critical infrastructure provider for AI workloads. At a time when competitors like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google Cloud are rapidly scaling their infrastructure to meet surging AI demand, Oracle's supply chain challenges represent a competitive disadvantage that could cost it critical market share.With a 2.2% decline in the year-to-date period, ORCL has underperformed both the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500, which dropped 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively.Year-to-date PerformanceInvestment Outlook: Wait for a Better Entry PointDespite Oracle's impressive cloud growth and AI strategy, investors may want to exercise caution in the near term. The company currently trades at elevated valuation multiples relative to historical norms, while facing potential headwinds from component supply chain issues that have temporarily constrained cloud capacity expansion.While the backlog of $130 billion provides strong visibility into future growth, the company indicated that component delays have slowed cloud capacity expansion, potentially limiting near-term revenue conversion. Safra Catz noted that these constraints should ease in first-quarter fiscal 2026, which suggests that better growth acceleration may materialize later in 2025.Oracle's heavy capital expenditures, expected to exceed $16 billion for fiscal 2025, will pressure free cash flow in the immediate future. The trailing 12-month free cash flow of $5.8 billion represents a 53% year-over-year decline, primarily due to strategic infrastructure investments.Given these mixed signals, investors may find better entry points later in 2025 as cloud capacity constraints ease and the significant investments in AI infrastructure begin to generate stronger returns. The long-term thesis remains compelling, but patience could yield more attractive valuation opportunities for this cloud and AI transformation story. Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"US tech firms Nvidia, AMD secure AI deals as Trump tours Gulf states",1747146903000,"A number of U.S. technology firms on Tuesday announced artificial intelligence deals in the Middle East as U.S. President Donald Trump secured $600 billion in commitments from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies during a tour of Gulf states.Among the biggest deals, Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a deal with Humain, saying it has formed a $10 billion collaboration. Another company to announce a deal with Humain, was Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ:QCOM , which said it signed a memo of understanding to develop and build a data centre central processor (CPU). The San Diego-based chip designer bought server CPU maker Nuvia in 2021 but has not yet released a product. Trump began his Gulf tour on Tuesday, kicking it off with the signing of a strategic economic agreement with Saudi Arabia as the oil power rolled out the red carpet. Trump's Middle East visit aims to drum up trillions of dollars in investments.The deals will flow both ways. The White House said Saudi Arabian firm DataVolt will invest $20 billion in AI data centres and energy infrastructure in the United States. Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google, DataVolt, Oracle Corp NYSE:ORCL , Salesforce Inc NYSE:CRM , Advanced Micro Devices and Uber NYSE:UBER will invest $80 billion in cutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries, the White House said, without giving details.Trump plans to visit the UAE on Thursday. The New York Times on Monday reported that the Trump administration is nearing a deal to allow UAE to buy large volumes of Nvidia's AI chips.Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and a leading centre for AI activity outside the United States.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday launched Humain to develop and manage AI technologies in Saudi Arabia.AI CHIP DEALSNvidia and Humain said they will leverage Nvidia's platforms to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in AI, GPU cloud computing and digital transformation.In a joint statement, the two companies said they will build AI factories with up to 500 megawatts of capacity that will include ""several hundred thousand"" of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs over five years.In Humain's deal with AMD, the agreement includes a plan to invest up to $10 billion to deploy 500 megawatts of AI hardware infrastructure over five years. The Humain-AMD deal, in addition to hardware purchases, involves a collaboration that aims to help Humain implement a next-generation AI cloud computing platform, according to Keith Strier, AMD senior vice president of global AI markets. ""Together, we are building a globally significant AI platform that delivers performance, openness and reach at unprecedented levels,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said in a statement.With some capacity set to come online in 2026, Humain will oversee the delivery of the data-crunching power to potential customers, while AMD will provide CPUs, GPUs and its software that helps orchestrate the data crunching. Part of the rationale for closing a deal with AMD is to ensure Humain isn't locked into using a single vendor for AI-related hardware, Strier said. ""And now, in addition to building infrastructure, countries recognize they need to do it in a very resilient way, in these diverse ways,"" Strier said. Chaired by bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Humain will operate under the Public Investment Fund and will offer AI services and products, including data centres, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models.""In building an AI company, you need the foundation and the infrastructure,"" Humain CEO Tareq Amin said on stage from Riyadh on Tuesday.

U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to address AI chip smuggling,1747314000000,"A bipartisan group of eight U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill on Thursday that would require makers of artificial intelligence chips such as Nvidia to include technology to verify the location of their chips before exporting them.The Chip Security Act introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to address reports of U.S. export-controlled AI chips being smuggled into China. U.S. officials across presidential administrations have sought to clamp down on their export to China, but Reuters and other news organizations have documented how some of those chips have continued to flow.""In order for the United States to maintain our technological advantage, we must employ safeguards to help ensure export controls are not being circumvented, allowing these advanced AI chips to fall into the hands of nefarious actors,"" Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who introduced the House bill, said in a statement.Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, introduced a similar bill in the U.S. Senate last week.The House bill was co-led by Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat, who was a physicist before becoming a legislator and designed several of his own chips during his scientific career. ""I know that we have the technical tools to prevent powerful AI technology from getting into the wrong hands,"" Foster said in a statement.The House bill comes after President Donald Trump's administration rescinded a rule enacted by predecessor President Joe Biden that would have regulated the flow of advanced AI chips around the world. The Trump administration has not yet announced a replacement rule.But Trump this week toured the Middle East, where he announced a spate of deals to send AI chips to countries in the Middle East, despite growing opposition from some inside the U.S. government. In addition to Foster and Huizenga, also co-leading the House bill are House Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat. Reps. Ted Lieu, California Democrat; Rick Crawford, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee; Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat; and Darin LaHood, an Illinois Republican were co-sponsors.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0Z7:0-u-s-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-address-ai-chip-smuggling/"

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government.

Market Chatter: US Working on Deal to Increase Saudi Access to Advanced Semiconductors,1747135592000,"The Trump administration is preparing to announce a deal that would give Saudi Arabia more access to advanced semiconductors and increase the country's ability to purchase chips from major US companies such as Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD , Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The US and Saudi governments have reached an early-stage agreement, but are still hashing out numerous key details, the unnamed sources told the news outlet. US President Donald Trump could announce a deal as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported. A potential deal would clear the path for increased data center capacity in Saudi Arabia despite concerns from some US officials about its ties to China, according to the report.

"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Influence NVIDIA’s Q1 ResultsNVIDIA’s first-quarter top line is likely to have benefited from the continued strength in its Datacenter business. The increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is anticipated to have boosted demand for its chips across the datacenter end market. An increase in hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have acted as tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.The Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $38.5 billion, which indicates robust year-over-year growth of 70.6%.Moreover, NVIDIA’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s results have improved year over year in six out of the last seven quarters, as inventory levels with channel partners have returned to normal. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market is pegged at $3.29 billion, which implies a 24.4% increase from the year-ago quarter’s level.NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing in six consecutive quarters. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $567.6 million, which suggests a 32.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The company’s Automotive segment demonstrated an improvement in trends over the preceding four quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $551.7 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 67.7%.NVIDIA Stock Price Performance & ValuationShares of NVIDIA have remained highly volatile over the past year. NVDA stock has gained 27% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s growth of 23.5%. The stock has also outperformed major semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology have lost 30.1%, 24% and 19.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value NVIDIA offers investors at the current levels. NVIDIA is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 15.48X compared with the industry’s 13.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.NVDA also trades at a premium compared with other semiconductor players, including Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology. Currently, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology trade at a forward P/S multiples of 5.37X, 2.48X and 5.94X, respectively.Investment Consideration for NVIDIAOver the past year, NVIDIA’s revenue growth has been driven by robust demand for chips required for the development of generative AI models. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven useful across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications. The global generative AI market size is anticipated to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, according to a new report by Fortune Business Insights. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.However, the complexity of generative AI, which requires vast knowledge and immense computational power, means that enterprises will need to significantly upgrade their network infrastructures. NVIDIA’s AI chips, including the A100, H100 and B100, are the top choices for building and running these powerful AI applications, positioning the company as a leader in this space. As the generative AI revolution unfolds, we expect NVIDIA's advanced chips to drive substantial growth in both its revenues and market presence.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into AI, data centers and autonomous vehicles. The company's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity.However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility. For now, holding the stock is the smartest approach.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:9d0301faa094b:0-nvidia-s-q1-earnings-coming-up-time-to-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock/

"US close to letting UAE import millions of Nvidia's AI chips, sources say",1747255290000,"The U.S. has a preliminary agreement with the United Arab Emirates to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA most advanced AI chips per year, starting in 2025, two sources familiar with the situation said, boosting the Emirates' construction of data centers vital to developing artificial intelligence models. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreement was at least through 2027, but that there was a chance it could be in place until 2030.The draft deal called for 20% of the chips, or 100,000 of them per year, to go to UAE's tech firm G42, while the rest would be split among U.S. companies with massive AI operations like Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Oracle NYSE:ORCL that might also seek to build data centers in the UAE, the sources said.They said the agreement is still being negotiated and could change before being finalized. One source said the deal, elements of which were first reported by the New York Times, faced growing opposition in the U.S. government over the past day. The Biden administration issued restrictions on AI chip exports to control the flow of the sophisticated processors worldwide, in part to keep the prized semiconductors from being diverted to China, where they could bolster Beijing's military.U.S. President Donald Trump this week is on a tour of the Gulf region and on Tuesday announced $600 billion worth of commitments from Saudi Arabia, including deals to buy large quantities of chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD and Qualcomm NASDAQ:QCOM . Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.The chips in the UAE deal that would go to G42 would represent a tripling or quadrupling, in terms of compute power, that would have been available to the UAE under rules put in place by the administration of former President Joe Biden. The Trump administration said last week it planned to rescind that regulation. At present, the vast majority of AI computing power is deployed in the United States and China. If all the proposed deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power center in global AI competition. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, did not have a comment. The White House, G42 and the United Arab Emirates did not have an immediate comment. Nvidia declined to comment.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, the UAE's ruling family and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42. The tech holding group's chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE national security adviser and brother of the Emirates' president.The preliminary agreement also aims to promote data centers in the U.S. It currently says that for every facility G42 builds in the UAE, it must build a similar one in the U.S., the sources said.One of the sources said the definition of what is an advanced AI chip would be figured out in a separate working group that will be created later, along with security requirements.The proposed numbers of chips are for the most advanced graphics processing units, one of the sources said. As of now, that could refer to Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are more powerful than the previous generation of Hopper chips, or Nvidia's forthcoming Rubin chips, which are more powerful than both of their predecessors.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM0V4:0-us-close-to-letting-uae-import-millions-of-nvidia-s-ai-chips-sources-say/"

20 stocks of companies showing excellent earnings-season trends even as the economy cools,1747063080000,"By Philip van DoornCompanies showing rapid sales growth and improving profit margins include Eli Lilly, Micron, AMD and NewmontEvery quarter during earnings season it can be useful to see which companies have improved their profit margins while also increasing their revenue. With U.S. economic growth turning negative during the first quarter, this earnings season's results might shed some light on which companies may best weather the disruption brought about by President Donald Trump's ""liberation day"" tariffs announced on April 2.Below is a screen of companies in the S&P 500 SPX that have fared best this earnings season.On April 30, Christine Idzelis explained that an increase of inventories contributed to the contraction of the U.S. real gross domestic product during the first quarter, as companies anticipated the tariffs.Because the new tariffs were announced in early April, second-quarter results might provide a more drastic comparison, depending on how much spending habits have changed. But the reversal from a 2.4% GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter to a slight contraction in the first quarter may have been enough to make for some difficult year-over-year comparisons of quarterly results.Screening for earnings-season winnersOne problem with an earnings-season screen is that about 20% of companies in the S&P 500 have fiscal reporting periods that don't match the calendar. This means there is no clear end to earnings season. Through Friday, 450 companies, or 90% of the S&P 500, had reported results for fiscal quarters that ended Feb. 15 or later. And the results for this group showed a slight decline in sales growth, but also improved efficiency.This is how we screened the 450 companies:- Increased quarterly sales per share from the year-earlier quarter. We screened for changes in sales per share rather than raw revenue, because the per-share numbers incorporated any dilution to a company's stock if it issued shares to raise money or to help finance the acquisition of another company. Sales will rise if a company acquires a competitor, but the per-share figure illustrates how much of that increase is ""available"" to investors who held the acquiring company's stock before the new shares were issued. On the other hand, sales per share will increase more rapidly than revenue if a company lowers its share count by repurchasing stock. All per-share figures are adjusted by FactSet for any stock splits. - Improved gross profit margins. A company's gross margin is its net sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. Net sales are sales minus returns and discounts, such as coupons. The cost of goods or services sold includes the actual expenses when making the items or providing the services. Gross margin is a measurement of pricing power and core efficiency. - Improved operating margins. A company's operating margin incorporates more overhead and other expenses that aren't directly related to the production of goods and services. It can be summarized as earnings before interest and taxes, divided by sales.Profit margins vary by industry. For example, auto manufacturers will be expected to have lower gross margins than mature software companies. So comparisons may be most useful between companies with similar business models.A combination of sales growth and improving gross and operating margins is a good sign for any company. It indicates the company isn't being forced to offer discounts to defend its market share.Among the 450 companies we screened, gross and operating margins were available for 404 of them. These figures aren't available for many companies in the financial sector, because banks and insurers have their own industry-based measures of profitability. For a handful of companies, operating margins weren't available for the most recent reported quarters because the companies' earnings press releases didn't include enough information for FactSet to calculate the margins. These calculations must wait until full 10-Q reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Among the 404 companies subject to the screen:- 75% reported increased quarterly sales per share from the year-earlier quarter. That was down from 80% showing year-over-year increases the previous quarter. - 55% showed improved quarterly gross margins from the year-earlier quarter. That was up from 47% showing year-over-year improvement the previous quarter. - 58% improved their quarterly operating margins, which was up from 56% the previous quarter.Improvements on two out of the three metrics make first-quarter earnings season look very good for the S&P 500, despite the economic disruption from the tariffs.To narrow down the list, here are the 20 companies showing the largest increases in sales per share while also improving their gross and operating margins:Click on the tickers for more about each company.Read: Tomi Kilgore's detailed guide to the information available on the MarketWatch quote pageExpand Energy (EXE) tops the list, with quarterly revenue per share more than doubling. The company was formerly Chesapeake Energy Corp. and began operating under its current name when it acquired Southwestern Energy Co. in October.Eli Lilly (LLY) ranks fourth on the list, with sales per share rising nearly 46%. On Sunday the company announced results of clinical trials of its Zepbound GLP-1 weight-loss medication that it said showed ""superiority compared to Wegovy,"" a rival medication made by Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO).Through Friday, Newmont (NEM) was the best-performing stock on this list for 2025, with a year-to-date gain of 46% with dividends reinvested, as the price of continuous front-month gold contracts (GC00) on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 27% to $3,344 an ounce. But gold was down 3% and Newmont's stock was down 5% early Monday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a preliminary deal between the U.S. and China to lower tariffs.Don't miss: How high-yield bond funds like these can lower your investment risk-Philip van DoornThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Stifel analyst Ruben Roy reaffirmed a Buy rating and raised his price objective to $132, about 16% above current levels. He argues that ZT's 1,200 engineers will accelerate development of AMD's rack-scale AI systems and that Sanmina's flexible manufacturing capabilities align well with cloud and AI deployments.Wells Fargo's Aaron Rakers also maintained a Buy rating, setting a $120 target, citing AMD's long-term AI potential. He highlighted the upcoming Instinct MI400-series GPUs and expects Sanmina to speed AI system rollouts for large-scale data-center customers.In contrast, Citi's Christopher Danely kept a Hold rating with a $100 objective. Danely focused on the $1.6 billion discount between AMD's $4.6 billion acquisition of ZT and the $3 billion sale price, noting the financial haircut but acknowledging the deal could still strengthen AMD's data-center GPU scaling.Overall, analysts view the ZT divestiture as a strategic move to sharpen AMD's focus on its core chip and AI businesses, though they differ on its immediate impact on valuation and earnings.Is AMD Stock a Buy?Based on the one year price targets offered by 41 analysts, the average target price for Advanced Micro Devices Inc is $128.44 with a high estimate of $200.00 and a low estimate of $75.00. The average target implies a upside of +13.15% from the current price of $113.51.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Advanced Micro Devices Inc in one year is $162.56, suggesting a upside of +43.21% from the current price of $113.51.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:3babf7208094b:0-top-analysts-ride-the-amd-ai-wave-post-3-billion-zt-systems-deal/

TSMC Stock Rises as Sales Surge. What It Means for the AI Trade. — Barrons.com,1746799380000,"By Adam ClarkTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing sales are continuing to boom. It's a good sign for companies providing artificial-intelligence infrastructure, although some of the boost is likely being driven by fears of tariffs.Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, said Thursday its revenue for April came to 349.57 billion New Taiwan dollars, a 48% increase from the previous year and its highest ever monthly sales figure.The Taiwanese chip manufacturer didn't provide any detail on what drove the surge but it's probably safe to say it has plenty to do with AI hardware. TSMC previously said it expects revenue from AI-related servers and processors to double in 2025.TSMC is a crucial player in the AI-chip market. It's the main supplier of chips to Nvidia — the leader of semiconductors used for AI applications. TSMC also makes the core processors inside Apple iPhones, Qualcomm mobile chipsets, and processors made by Advanced Micro Devices.However, it's likely that the strength is slightly deceptive, as sales could be driven by customers buying chips before the potential imposition of tariffs. TSMC has continued to guide for mid-20% growth in sales this year, well below the 44% increase seen in the first four months of the year.President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested he is considering imposing tariffs on chips produced outside the U.S., and it isn't clear if TSMC would receive a waiver on such levies despite pledging a total of $165 billion in American investment.American depositary receipts of TSMC have dropped 11% this year as chip companies' shares succumbed to tariff turmoil. The ADRs were up 1.9% early on Friday.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Buy the Spike in AMD Stock After Q1 Earnings?,1746734820000,"Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD stock has risen 5% since surpassing its Q1 expectations on Tuesday, with the post-earnings rally gaining steam as President Trump boosted markets by announcing a new trade deal with the United Kingdom.With Trump revisiting the rhetoric of keeping chip manufacturing dominance in the U.S., it’s certainly a worthy topic of whether now is a good time to buy AMD stock for more upside.AMD’s Consistency Continues Stating AMD delivered an outstanding start to the year despite evolving dynamics related to tariffs and the regulatory environment, CEO Lisa Su highlighted that the company’s growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter.Driven by Data Center and AI momentum, AMD’s Q1 sales spiked 36% to $7.43 billion compared to $5.47 billion a year ago, and topped estimates of $7.12 billion. Notably, AMD has surpassed top line expectations for 10 straight quarters. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS climbed 55% to $0.96 versus $0.62 a share in the prior year quarter. Exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus of $0.93, AMD has now reached or exceeded earnings expectations for 25 consecutive quarters. AMD’s Revenue Guidance Providing Q2 guidance, AMD expects revenue at $7.4 billion plus or minus $300 million, which would reflect 27% growth. This is on par with the current Zacks Consensus (Current Qtr Below) and includes an estimated $700 million revenue reduction from the new export license requirements for its MI308 AI accelerator chips to China, a modified version of its superior MI300X chip.For the full year, AMD estimates the revenue impact due to the export license requirement to be approximately $1.5 billion. Based on Zacks' estimates, AMD’s total sales are now expected to increase 21% in fiscal 2025 to $31.31 billion compared to $25.79 billion last year. Plus, FY26 sales are projected to rise another 19% to $37.17 billion. AMD Stock Performance Despite the post-earnings bump, AMD stock is still down 15% year to date, a steeper decline than the broader indexes and chip competitor Nvidia’s NVDA -12%. Over the last three years, AMD is only up +19%, trailing the market’s returns and Nvidia’s eye-popping gains of nearly +600%.Bottom Line Although AMD is currently the second-largest producer of AI GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) behind Nvidia, the excitement for its growth potential has worn off in recent years. For now, AMD stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q1 report.To that point, more upside may largely depend on the trend of earnings estimate revisions in the coming weeks as analysts digest the impact that tariffs will have on the chipmaker. This includes the export license requirements, as the ongoing trade war with China plays out.

US Equities Markets Rise Monday as Investors Assess Moody's Downgrade,1747685144000,"US benchmark equity indexes ended higher Monday on a late rally as markets assessed a Moody's downgrade of the nation's credit rating and comments by a Federal Reserve official. * On Friday, Moody's lowered the world's largest economy's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Aa1 from Aaa, citing a sustained increase in debt and interest payment ratios. Moody's revised its outlook on the US to stable from negative. * The downgrade may weigh on global confidence in US Treasuries, Wells Fargo Investment Institute said. * ""While demand for Treasuries is likely to remain strong, in our view, reduced foreign appetite — already evident following President Donald Trump's tariff announcements — could exacerbate fiscal pressures,"" the report said. * Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he prefers only one rate cut in 2025 for now with tariffs larger than the Fed anticipated at the start of the year.

AMD’s AI-Powered Stock Price Rally Just Shifted Gears,1747238700000,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ:AMD long-awaited AI-powered stock price rally is here. The stock is rocketing higher after a string of good news, including reduced trade tensions with China, a new deal with Saudi Arabia’s HUMAIN, and a new $6 billion share buyback authorization. The authorization, a sign of the board's confidence in future free cash flow , is worth an additional $6 billion on top of the $4 billion left under the existing. The total $10 billion in potential share repurchases is worth about 5.5% of the market cap in mid-May and a potentially strong tailwind. It is potentially strong because repurchase activity in 2024 failed to reduce the count, stock-based compensation awards more than offset their impact and may do so again in 2025. However, the first quarter results included a slight reduction in the diluted count that may persist and even accelerate as the year progresses.Other figures that investors should be watching are the cash, assets, and equity, which are all increasing. The company’s Q1 balance sheet highlights included a 50% YOY increase in cash , increased receivables and inventory , steady debt levels , and reduced liability . The net result was a 5% increase in equity and an expectation for equity gains to accelerate as the year progresses. The outlook for the year was amplified by recent news, including a $10 billion deal with HUMAIN. HUMAIN, Saudi Arabia’s newly formed AI enterprise, inked a $10 billion deal for AI infrastructure backed by President Trump. The deal involves 500 megawatts of AI compute capacity using AMD's most advanced semiconductor technology and is expected to play out over five years.The impact on AMD's outlook is significant and worth 3100 basis points of revenue growth relative to the 2025 consensus forecast reported by MarketBeat. Analysts Cheer Eye-Opening Moment for AI Investors The analyst's response to the Saudi news was overwhelmingly bullish. Bank of America analysts view Advanced Micro Devices as a top-winner alongside NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , while the Dan Ives-led Wedbush team called it an eye-opening moment . They view the deal and the others announced alongside it as a clear signal that Saudi Arabia will be a significant player in AI for years to come.Saudi Arabia's AI investment could top $1 trillion within years and open the door to expanding possibilities for all things AI. Ultimately, the factor that matters is that the analyst group is  lifting price targets again and leading to the high-end range, a gain of 50% relative to mid-May trading levels. Advanced Micro Devices' upcoming Q2 earnings release, scheduled for late July, will be a market-moving event for this stock. Not only is there a high probability that the company will outperform its consensus estimates for revenue and earnings, but the guidance will likely be strong .Demand was strong before the Saudi deal and will only increase in its wake. The risk is China. The curb on exports to China will impact the results, but may be limited. Saudi Arabia will make up for the lost revenue.Advanced Micro Devices Stock Price Reaches a Critical Pivot PointAdvanced Micro Devices' stock price advanced by 15% within two days of the HUMAIN announcement and will likely continue to move higher. However, there is a risk of resistance at a critical pivot point, including the long-term 30-week EMA, representing institutional buy-and-hold investors.If the market is unable to get above the level quickly, there is a risk that AMD’s share price will remain range-bound at current levels. A move above the 30-week EMA would be a bullish sign, indicating  improved market sentiment and an all-clear to investors . The market for AMD stock would likely move up to $147.50 soon after and potentially continue rising through the year’s end. Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:0f5677575094b:0-amd-s-ai-powered-stock-price-rally-just-shifted-gears/
Nvidia and 29 Other Stocks to Play AI — Barrons.com,1746732720000,"By Teresa RivasWhile tariffs have caused tech stocks to bend, they won't break, a longtime bull says. It's all thanks to artificial intelligence.The technology sector has been one of the harder-hit areas during the 2025 market downturn. Even as stocks have started to rebound amid hopes for tariff negotiations, the Nasdaq Composite is still down more than 8% year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's loss, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund is off some 13%.Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that tech's underdog status won't last. Perhaps most obviously, the artificial intelligence genie can't be put back in the bottle. AI is becoming increasingly mainstream, whether it's people talking to chatbots, retailers using it to personalize their promotional efforts, or companies hoping to improve efficiency and productivity.In short, the AI revolution will continue to play out for years to come. That's the stance of Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime tech bull. He calls AI the fourth industrial revolution in a new note Thursday, arguing that ""it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.""That creates an opportunity for multiple companies — and their investors — to win. He highlights 30 tech companies that he says will be long-term winners across six areas: hyperscalers, software, consumer internet, cybersecurity, autonomous and robotics, and semiconductors and hardware.Often thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" of AI, semiconductors and hardware makers are the second largest group in his list. They have also been some of the most well-known AI beneficiaries, including Nvidia — Ives calls co-founder Jensen Huang the ""godfather of AI.""Naturally Ives still likes the stock, along with Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. He says AMD will continue to strengthen its position and gain market share, and Taiwan Semi — the world's leading chip foundry — will make it a beneficiary of the global increase in AI investments. In addition, Micron has ""an enviable position within memory,"" while Broadcom, the world leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cloud and AI, will benefit from the buildout of these technologies.More than 15% of cloud services now include some AI component, making hyperscalers another area of huge investments. Major companies in the space ""are expected to spend $325 billion+ in 2025 through AI capital expenditures, representing 40% year-over-year growth and over $100 billion year-over-year increase as data center buildouts continue with the AI Arms Race only just beginning,"" Ives writes."" Microsoft is currently in the driver's seat,"" he says, adding that Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, and Oracle aren't far behind.With both people and businesses ramping up their use of AI, consumer internet companies stand to benefit, too, Ives says. Positives could include AI customer service, to improved search, personalization of ads, and dynamic pricing.His favorite picks stateside are Apple — he estimates about a quarter of the world's population will eventually access AI through an Apple device — and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is still seeing strong underlying demand. Among Chinese stocks, he highlights Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu. It's becoming ""clearer [Alibaba] could be one of the winners in the China AI Arms Race,"" he writes, while Baidu is another major Chinese player poised to do well.Robotics is another key area, as the ""global autonomous vehicle market size is expected to reach $3.22 trillion by 2033 representing a 36% compound annual growth rate,"" Ives writes. Tesla's robo-taxis earn it a spot here, while nuclear energy start-up Oklo will help meet the increasing power demands of automation.Of course, all of these advancements make cybersecurity more important than ever. Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and CyberArk Software are his picks here.Software is the largest category, as 1 billion apps will be with generative AI by 2028, Ive says, noting ""the software era of AI use cases [is] already under way."" Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, IBM, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Adobe, Pegasystems, MongoDB, C3.ai, Elastic, Innodata, and SoundHound are on his list of winners.Tariffs remain a worry, though Ives predicts they won't dent the AI revolution in the long run.He isn't the only optimist on this front. 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere writes Thursday that investors will likely return to megacap tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven because the U.S. economy will likely avoid a recession, though it might slow.""High-quality, monopolistic companies with strong earnings momentum are favorable in our base case of an economic muddle through, especially after large price drawdowns,"" he writes.Time to ask ChatGPT if tech is cheap enough to buy the dip.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

AMD stock rallies on stock buyback announcement: find out more,1747234829000,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ:AMD is pushing significantly to the upside this morning after announcing a material increase to its share repurchase authorisation.On Wednesday, the company’s board authorised another $6 billion worth of buybacks, reflecting “confidence in AMD’s strategic direction, growth prospects and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow.”The chipmaker is now authorised to repurchase about $10 billion worth of its stock in total. AMD’s extended program “has no termination date,” as per its press release today.At the time of writing, AMD shares are up more than 50% versus their low in early April.Why is the buyback announcement significant for AMD stock?AMD choosing to expand its existing buyback program is a meaningful development for investors, given repurchases often suggest the management currently sees the stock as undervalued. Additionally, buybacks decrease the number of outstanding shares, which can trigger an increase in earnings per share. A higher EPS tends to attract investors and strengthen the company’s stock price.Share repurchase initiatives are positive also because they create buying pressure, helping stabilise a firm’s stock price during volatile markets. AMD stock has been in a sharp uptrend in recent weeks as the Trump administration continued to sign trade agreements with global leaders. Most recently, the White House even agreed to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China as well.Still, Advanced Micro Devices shares are down more than 8.0% versus their YTD high at writing.AMD has secured a sizable deal from Saudi ArabiaInvestors are cheering AMD stock also because the chipmaker has recently inked a multi-year AI infrastructure deal with Humain – a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.The said collaboration will “deploy up to 500 megawatts of AI infrastructure, powered by the full spectrum of AMD compute,” as per the multinational’s press release on Wednesday.The Saudi agreement made Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya raise his price target on Advanced Micro Devices in a research note this morning to $130.His upwardly revised price target on AMD shares represents potential upside of another 9.0% from here.Why is Bank of America bullish on AMD shares?BofA is positive on AMD stock as “Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investment with a focus on training and inference of LLMs in local culture, language, and needs.”Plus, it could help boost power availability for data centres in the US as well, BofA analyst Vivek Arya told clients in a research note on Wednesday.Note that the Kingdom, more broadly, has recently pledged up to $600 billion worth of investments in the US.That said, the AI stock remains unattractive for income investors since it does not currently pay a dividend.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:32e4c645e094b:0-amd-stock-rallies-on-stock-buyback-announcement-find-out-more/
Chips Stocks Rise as U.S. Plans to Overhaul Curbs on AI Chip Exports,1746716580000,"By Kelly CloonanChip stocks rose across the board as the Trump administration plans to overhaul export regulations on U.S. chip companies.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.8% to $104.20 on Thursday. Intel rose 2.3%, while Qualcomm and Broadcom both ticked up around 1%. Nvidia shares remained flat.The Commerce Department plans to replace a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips countries like India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel can buy, a spokeswoman said.The rule, commonly known as AI diffusion, had been set to go into effect May 15. It aimed to prevent other countries from routing U.S. chips to adversaries like China, but was seen as controversial across the tech industry. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle argued it would harm American companies' business prospects abroad without doing much to hinder China.Other regulations appear to remain for now, though. The Trump administration recently issued new export-licensing requirements covering Nvidia's H20 chips, which the company said would result in a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings.

The firm dubbed the server maker ""a market leader in AI-optimized infrastructure"" and lauded its ability to offer ""competitive pricing"" relative to peers.Also on Tuesday, Super Micro said it had shipped a number of high-density servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices' EPYC 4005 series processors, and separately announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt.The multi-year partnership is meant to accelerate the delivery of GPU platforms and rack systems for DataVolt's hyperscale campuses, the companies said.Shares received an additional boost along with the broader market after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. Super Micro ended Tuesday's session up 16% at $38.89.Regardless of the sharp gains, the stock remains down 53% from its 52-week high and off 62% from its record closing high of $118.81, which it notched in March 2024.Shares peaked at the end of February after the server maker narrowly avoided delisting from the Nasdaq by filing a string of delayed financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Despite the company's proclamation that the matter was ""closed,"" auditor BDO expressed an adverse opinion, stating that Super Micro ""did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.""An adverse opinion indicates that a company's financial statements are misrepresented or inaccurate. While months have passed since the debacle, Raymond James analysts argued that the company's ""reputational risk"" was dampening its valuation.The sudden increase in Super Micro's price, amounting to a 39% gain over the past three days, raises questions as to whether the stock is caught in a short squeeze.A short squeeze occurs when the price of a stock rises unexpectedly instead of falling, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares to diminish their losses. This collective buying can drive up a stock's price even further.As of May 2, 108.28 million shares were sold short, representing 21% of Super Micro's float. As a general rule of thumb, short interest between 10% and 20% is considered high, while any value exceeding 20% is extremely high.Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia Stock Wavers as Trump Plans to Scrap Biden's Chip-Export Rules — Barrons.com,1746716340000,"Adam ClarkNvidia and other semiconductor stocks were rising Thursday as the Trump administration said it plans to scrap regulations that would limit exports of artificial-intelligence chips worldwide.Nvidia shares were down 0.3% at $116.71 in Thursday morning trading, after gaining more than 3% the previous day. Advanced Micro Devices stock was gaining 2.6%, and Broadcom stock was rising 0.4%.Chip makers were rising after the Commerce Department said Wednesday afternoon that it doesn't intend to implement AI processor restrictions drawn up under the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported . The curbs were set to go into effect on May 15 and would have limited sales more widely than existing sanctions on exports to China.The so-called ""AI diffusion"" rules were expected to reduce the long-term market for AI chips by as much as 10%, according to analysts at BofA Securities.""We welcome the administration's leadership and new direction on AI policy. With the AI Diffusion Rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, "" Nvidia said in an emailed statement.However, it isn't clear if the overhaul will lead to alternative rules on chip exports, which could potentially be even more onerous. The White House has considered including AI-processor limits as part of bilateral agreements with individual countries, according to the report.More information could come with President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Middle East next week, where AI chip exports are likely to be on the agenda.""We generally expect that Trump will increase the total of chips allowed to be sold globally, starting with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but this could also come with more enforcement to prevent the diversion of banned chips to China,"" wrote Raymond James analyst Ed Mills in a research note.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AI execs say US must increase exports, improve infrastructure to beat China",1746714728000,"Top executives at American AI giants OpenAI, Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD said at a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday that while the U.S. is ahead in the artificial-intelligence race, Washington needs to boost infrastructure and champion AI chip exports to stay ahead of Beijing.The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, is looking to cut regulatory barriers to U.S. artificial intelligence after China's DeepSeek shocked the world with a high-quality, affordable AI model last year and as Huawei, long in Washington's crosshairs, unveiled an advanced AI chip.The U.S. tech industry has seized on those concerns to lobby the Trump administration for more favorable policies including loosened export restrictions on AI chips, arguing that promoting worldwide use of AI that reflects democratic values is a matter of national interest.""The number-one factor that will define whether the U.S. or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith, adding that concerns about Chinese propaganda and personal data flows to China had driven his own company to bar employees from using DeepSeek.""The lesson from Huawei and 5G is that whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant,"" he said.The Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, which also makes an advanced AI chip, has faced U.S. restrictions over concerns its equipment could be used to spy on users. Reuters reported last month that Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] is ramping up to make mass shipments of advanced AI chips to Chinese customers.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, maker of flagship AI model ChatGPT, and Lisa Su, CEO of AI chipmaker AMD, also testified at the hearing.Altman told the panel he expects societal advances from AI to accelerate in the next few years through U.S. innovation, but that ""investment in infrastructure is critical.""Such infrastructure includes everything from data centers to house more servers to power stations that fuel the energy-intensive calculations needed to drive AI. In addition, Microsoft's Smith called for more education on AI to speed up adoption, training to increase the number of electricians, and support for AI research and development.DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based upstart, stunned the world last year when it unveiled a powerful AI model competitive with the likes of OpenAI and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , but cheaper to run.The move was surprising against the backdrop of sweeping rules imposed by former President Joe Biden's administration, aimed at cutting off China from American AI chips and capabilities, over fears Beijing could use the powerful technology to supercharge its military.The Trump administration has so far taken a similar approach, last month imposing new licensing requirements on shipments to China of AI chips made by Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and AMD that the companies designed to get around prior export restrictions.But the Trump administration also plans to rescind and replace a set of AI chip export curbs unveiled during the waning days of the Biden administration, which were set to take effect on May 15. Cruz, Su and Altman all applauded the decision at the hearing. ""The Biden administration's misguided midnight AI diffusion rule on chips and model weights would have crippled American tech companies' ability to sell AI to the world,"" Cruz said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RG0RF:0-ai-execs-say-us-must-increase-exports-improve-infrastructure-to-beat-china/"

US AI execs to give Congress policy wishlist for beating China,1746698400000,"Top executives at American AI giants OpenAI, Microsoft and AMD are set to appear at a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday and outline ways they believe Washington can stay ahead of Beijing in the artificial intelligence race.The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, is looking to cut regulatory barriers to U.S. artificial intelligence after China's DeepSeek shocked the world with a high-quality, affordable AI model last year. The U.S. tech industry has seized on that development to lobby the Trump administration for more favorable policies, arguing that promoting worldwide use of AI that reflects democratic values is a matter of national interest.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, maker of flagship AI model ChatGPT, is expected to testify, as are Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT , and Lisa Su, CEO of AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) NASDAQ:AMD .Altman is expected to testify about societal advances he expects AI to bring about.""This future can be almost unimaginably bright, but only if we take concrete steps to ensure that an American-led version of AI, built on democratic values like freedom and transparency, prevails over an authoritarian one,"" Altman will say, according to prepared remarks seen by Reuters.The development of AI has depended on specialized computer chips, huge amounts of data to train large-language models, vast amounts of energy and a technically skilled workforce. Smith is expected to testify that to succeed, the U.S. will need to support companies at all layers of the AI ecosystem, and partner with allies around the world, according to his prepared remarks.Deepseek, a Hangzhou-based upstart, stunned the world last year when it unveiled a powerful AI model competitive with the likes of OpenAI and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , but cheaper to run.The move was surprising against the backdrop of sweeping rules imposed by President Joe Biden's administration, aimed at cutting off China from American AI chips and capabilities, over fears Beijing could use the powerful technology to supercharge its military. The Trump administration has so far taken a similar approach, last month imposing new licensing requirements on shipments to China of AI chips made by Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and AMD that the companies designed to get around prior export restrictions.But the limitations have spurred criticism from industry participants and some lawmakers who say the rules hamstring U.S. companies and hand the lucrative Chinese AI market to companies like Huawei, which has designed a competitive AI chip known as Ascend. ""The way to beat China in the AI race is to outrace them in innovation, not saddle AI developers with European-style regulations,"" Cruz said in a statement announcing the hearing.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RF1FK:0-us-ai-execs-to-give-congress-policy-wishlist-for-beating-china/"

Trump administration to rescind and replace Biden-era global AI chip export curbs,1746648170000,"U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration plans to rescind and modify a Biden-era rule that curbed the export of sophisticated artificial-intelligence chips, a spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday.The regulation was aimed at further restricting AI chip and technology exports, dividing up the world to keep advanced computing power in the United States and among its allies while finding more ways to block China's access.The Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion was issued in January, a week before the end of the administration of former President Joe Biden. It capped a four-year effort by the Biden administration to hobble China's access to advanced chips that could enhance its military capabilities and to maintain U.S. leadership in AI.""The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation,"" the Commerce spokeswoman said. ""We will be replacing it with a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance."" Last week, Reuters reported the Trump administration was working on changes to the rule that would limit global access to AI chips, including possibly doing away with its splitting the world into tiers that help determine how many advanced semiconductors a country can obtain.According to the Commerce spokeswoman, officials ""didn't like the tiered system"" and said the rule was ""unenforceable."" The spokeswoman did not have a timetable for the new rule. She said debate was still under way on the best course of action. The Biden rule was set to take effect on May 15.Shares of Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , an AI chip designer whose sales could rise if the rule were changed to increase exports, ended 3% higher after the news came out on Wednesday, but then dipped 0.7% in after-hours trade. The Biden rule divided the world into three tiers: 17 countries and Taiwan were in the first tier, which could receive unlimited chips. Some 120 other countries were in the second tier, which was subject to caps on the number of chips the countries could receive. In the third tier, countries of concern including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea were blocked from the chips.But Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach to access in the rule and replacing it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, sources told Reuters last week.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RF25H:0-trump-administration-to-rescind-and-replace-biden-era-global-ai-chip-export-curbs/"

"AMD's Business Tracking Better Than Expected due to Strength in Traditional Markets, Wedbush Says",1746643797000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD ""significantly outperformed in its traditional markets,"" including client central processing unit sales, server compute and gaming, which backed its Q1 results, Wedbush analysts said in a Wednesday research note. AMD's business is ""tracking better than expected,"" owing to its strength in these markets and a constructive outlook for the graphics processing units business, the brokerage said. Strength in these traditional markets into Q2 allows the company to mitigate a roughly $700 million headwind from the loss of the China data center GPU market. Wedbush said its only significant concern is whether the Administration would come up with ""another tariff/policy curve ball.""""While management is naturally cautious, we would note the possibility that the administration opts for another self-inflicted economic wound (this time targeting semiconductors) and that the conservatism AMD typically bakes into forecasts isn't enough to account for the impact of new tariffs/policy,"" Wedbush said. Even though the company is expecting ""sharp sequential downtick"" in Q2 data center GPU revenue due to the China factor, it remains upbeat on the second-half's GPU momentum, guiding flattish sales for Q3 and a resumption of growth in Q4 driven by MI350 product launch, the brokerage said. These factors ""should moderate investor fears that AMD may not participate in future AI market growth (or participate enough to drive the future model),"" Wedbush said. Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on the company, while raising the price target to $120 from $115.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250507:A3372482:0/

"Advanced Micro Devices 'Remarkably' Guides Q2 Revenue Above Street Despite Export Headwinds, Morgan Stanley Says",1746637679000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD pulled off a difficult feat Tuesday, reporting better-than-expected financial results for Q1 and ""remarkably"" raising its Q2 revenue forecast above Wall Street estimates, analysts at Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday in a research note. The chipmaker's improved Q2 outlook, climbing to a range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion, was maybe its most impressive accomplishment given the likely impact of export controls on China, the analysts said. Overall, the company is now expecting the restrictions on Chinese semiconductor sales to reduce revenue by around $1.5 billion this year, including a $700 million hit during the current quarter and the rest largely occurring during Q3, they said. ""That's a slightly smaller headwind that we had expected, but (still) in the ballpark,"" the analysts said. Based on the new guidance, Morgan Stanley is now expecting Advanced Micro to earn $0.54 per share in Q2, excluding one-time items, on around $7.41 billion in revenue. For 2025, the firm is projecting non-GAAP net income of $4.20 per share, down from $4.53 per share previously, and $32.41 billion in revenue, up from $31.48 billion. The Morgan Stanley analysts also lowered their price target for Advanced Micro shares to $121 from $137 while reiterating their equal-weight stock rating, citing macro-economic factors and a slightly more speculative position relative to rival chipmakers Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , especially with its artificial intelligence offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250507:A3372387:0/

Intel Excels in Stringent AI Benchmark: Should You Buy the Stock?,1746636420000,"Intel Corporation INTC recently announced that it has successfully achieved industry-first full NPU (Neural Processing Unit) compliance in the MLPerf Client v0.6 benchmark. MLPerf is an industry-standard benchmarking suite created to assess AI system performance. The newly released MLPerf Client v0.6 Benchmark is a subset of MLPerf designed to evaluate client devices such as laptops and PCs with a strong emphasis on large language model acceleration and NPU performance. It offers a clear assessment of hardware and software capabilities in swiftly handling AI tasks such as content generation and summarization.During the process, Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processors showcased the fastest NPU response time with an impressive token latency of just 1.09 seconds and the highest NPU throughput at 18.55 tokens per second. Intel also demonstrated remarkable GPU performance during the process. Intel Core Ultra processor is the only NPU to achieve complete compliance, accentuating its strong AI compute capabilities.Intel Rides on AI Traction, Portfolio OptimizationIntel has been taking several strategic decisions to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector, spanning cloud and enterprise servers to networks, volume clients, and ubiquitous edge environments, in line with the evolving market dynamics. Intel’s Xeon 6 processors with Performance-cores have garnered significant industry attention owing to their high-performance AI processing. Intel XEON platforms offer extensive performance improvements coupled with energy efficiency and easy-to-deploy software. With these features, Intel XEON has set a new benchmark in 5G cloud native core, which is driving demand from software vendors and independent telecom manufacturers. The company is witnessing solid market traction in the AI PC market. Backed by strong demand for its core Ultra Chips, Intel remains firmly on track to power more than 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025.Intel is also venturing into the automotive market to capitalize on the growing AI proliferation in that industry. The company’s second-generation AI-powered software-defined vehicle system-on-chip with multi-process node chiplet architecture brings advanced capabilities. The chip offers 10x performance enhancement for generative and multimodal AI, 3x graphics performance, and enhances camera and image processing features. Such state-of-the-art features will boost Intel’s new AI chip demand in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.Intel is divesting 51% of its Altera business to Silver Lake, a prominent global technology investment firm. The move highlights Intel’s strategy to reshape its portfolio, optimize cost structure, strengthen its liquidity position, and boost focus on core operations.One-Year INTC Stock Price PerformanceIntel has plunged 33.3% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 18.7%. The company has underperformed its peer NVIDIA Corporation NVDA but outperformed Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.INTC Plagued by Margin WoesDespite investing heavily in new chip design and manufacturing, Intel is playing a catch-up game with NVIDIA and AMD. In the CPU space, AMD has gained a strong foothold with its Ryzen and EPYC processors. AMD’s strategy of offering competitive pricing with high performance has challenged Intel’s dominance in the CPU market.In the graphics and AI acceleration space, NVIDIA has made significant inroads. It is witnessing strong demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Backed by strong industry expertise, both NVIDIA and AMD are aiming to expand their influence in the automotive segment. Intensifying competition with NVIDIA and AMD across multiple end markets is weighing on Intel’s margin.Intel’s debt-to-capital ratio stands at 32% compared to the industry average of 17.3%. As of March 31, 2025, Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $8.95 billion with $44.91 billion of long-term debt. A high debt level may limit sufficient cash flow generation, which is required to meet future debt obligations. Additionally, Intel has a significant presence in China. Growing Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can impact its operations.Estimate Revision Trend of INTCEarnings estimates for Intel for 2025 have moved down 37.5% to 30 cents over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has declined 28.32% to 81 cents. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock.End NoteIntel’s strong AI focus and the expansion of its portfolio offerings for AI PCs, data centers, and automotive markets are commendable. Its effort to lower costs and improve liquidity with strategic divestiture is a positive. However, intensifying competition in the commercial PC, server, storage and networking markets remains a major headwind. In addition, its high dependence on China, imposition of trade tariffs, and Beijing’s move to replace U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives are impeding Intel’s commercial prospects.Its high debt levels make it vulnerable to economic downturns and growing geopolitical unrest. Declining earnings estimate revisions underscore dwindling investors' confidence. Despite heavy investment in chipset innovation and AI acceleration, Intel’s ability to regain a competitive edge appears to be a challenging endeavor. Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"
AMD is a ‘stable second source for GPUs’: is that enough for AMD stock to rally?,1746632984000,"A deeper dive into the earnings release that Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD posted last night suggests the semiconductor stock may be worth owning at current levels, according to a BofA analyst.AMD earned 96 cents on a per-share basis on $7.44 billion in revenue in its fiscal Q1, with both numbers coming in handily above Street estimates.That made Vivek Arya, a senior Bank of America analyst, raise his rating on AMD stock to “buy” on Wednesday. Shares of the multinational chipmaker are currently down well over 20% versus their year-to-date high.AMD is strongly positioned to sustain demandIn his research note, Arya agreed that Advanced Micro Devices is significantly behind Nvidia in the data centre accelerators.However, the demand for its products will likely retain momentum as AMD has built a name for itself as a “stable second source alternative in GPUs.”Over time, as the company based out of Santa Clara, CA continues to improve its technology and AI products, it may steal market share from rivals, potentially leading to a stock price rally.Additionally, the Bank of America analyst sees “continued share gains against the incumbent” on the CPU front as well. Note that AMD stock does not currently pay a dividend.AMD stock has a huge total addressable marketAccording to AMD chief executive Lisa Su, new restrictions on the export of sophisticated chips to China under the Trump administration could result in a $1.5 billion hit in 2025.But that isn’t specific to Advanced Micro Devices. Its larger peer, Nvidia, has warned of billions of dollars worth of hits due to export controls in Q1 as well.Therefore, BofA’s Arya raised his price target on AMD shares this morning to $120, which translates to more than 20% upside from current levels.The Bank of America analyst remains bullish on the Nasdaq-listed firm also because it has a “multi-hundred billion addressable market opportunity in PC, server, high-end gaming, deep learning,” whereas its penetration currently sits at less than 30%, indicating massive room for growth.Wall Street agrees with BofA on Advanced Micro DevicesAdvanced Micro Devices now sees its sales coming in at $7.4 billion in its current financial quarter on a gross margin of about 43%. In comparison, analysts had called for $7.25 billion in revenue only.“While we face some headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including export controls, they’re more than offset by the powerful tailwinds from our leadership product portfolio,” Su told investors on the earnings call last night.Investors should note that BofA isn’t alone in keeping bullish on AMD stock. The consensus rating on the chipmaker also currently sits at “overweight” with the mean target of $131, indicating potential upside of about 30% from here.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:bdd244c4d094b:0-amd-is-a-stable-second-source-for-gpus-is-that-enough-for-amd-stock-to-rally/

Qualcomm to make data center processors that connect to Nvidia chips,1747634400000,"Qualcomm on Monday said it will make custom data center central processing units, or CPUs, that use technology from Nvidia to connect to Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.Nvidia's chips are dominant in the AI market but always paired with CPUs, a market traditionally dominated by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia has jumped into the CPU market itself, designing a chip using technology from Arm Holdings to develop its own ""Grace"" CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said it would return to the data center CPU market. In the 2010s, Qualcomm began developing an Arm-based CPU that it tested with Meta Platforms, but curtailed those efforts amid cost cuts and legal challenges.But after acquiring a team of ex-Apple chip designers in 2021, Qualcomm has quietly revived those efforts, again holding discussions with Meta about a data center CPU. Qualcomm last week confirmed that it has a letter of understanding with Saudi Arabian AI firm Humain to develop a custom data center CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said that its future chips would use technology from Nvidia that will help them communicate quickly with Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs), which are the mainstay of its AI chip portfolio.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack-scale architecture, we're advancing a shared vision of high-performance energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Cristiano Amon said on Monday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RP001:0-qualcomm-to-make-data-center-processors-that-connect-to-nvidia-chips/"
AMD Jumps On $10 Billion Saudi AI Partnership,1747210307000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD just scored a huge win with a $10 billion, multi-year deal to power Saudi Arabia's new HUMAIN AI hub with 500 megawatts of its chips and accelerators. Investors cheered, sending AMD shares up nearly 4% as they realized how much revenue could flow from building out that kind of GPU-heavy infrastructure.Lisa Su says the partnership advances global AI infrastructure by marrying AMD's open-architecture gear with HUMAIN's local ecosystem, while HUMAIN's CEO Tareq Amin calls it democratizing AI at the compute levelbasically putting next-gen performance in more hands. And this follows HUMAIN's own $5 billion AWS tie-up from earlier on Tuesday, showing Saudi Arabia's serious push to localize cloud and AI services.Why it matters: That $10 billion commitment bulks up AMD's data-center backlog and highlights how tech geopolitics are reshaping growth opportunities.Keep an eye on AMD's next earnings callinvestors will want to know how soon this deal starts padding the top line and what it means for profit margins as all that horsepower goes live.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:180962354094b:0-amd-jumps-on-10-billion-saudi-ai-partnership/
Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

$10 Billion AI Shockwave: Saudi Arabia Taps AMD to Build a Global Tech Empire,1747204951000,"Saudi Arabia is going all-in on AIand it just roped in a major U.S. chipmaker to help lead the charge. The Kingdom's new AI investment vehicle, Humain, has announced a $10 billion commitment to build a global AI backbone, including hyperscale data centers, clean energy infrastructure, and fiber-optic connectivity from Riyadh to the U.S. AMD NASDAQ:AMD will be supplying chips and software for the rollout. While it's not yet confirmed whether AMD is putting capital into the deal or acting strictly as a vendor, the move could signal a broader pivot: courting sovereign-backed AI projects as an alternative to chasing the usual Big Tech crowd.AMD's CEO Lisa Su called the partnership a significant milestone, hinting at a globally scaled AI architecture that could rival existing setups in openness and reach. With Nvidia also set to contribute chips, Humain appears to be spreading its bets across the AI hardware spectrum. The announcement was made at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh, with former President Donald Trump presenta setting that speaks volumes about the geopolitical stakes behind the deal. For AMD, this could be a shot at gaining market share in a space where Nvidia has long ruled the accelerator roost.Meanwhile, sources suggest the U.S. government is finalizing a deal to give Saudi Arabia broader access to advanced semiconductors, even as it keeps China on a tighter leash. That could pave the way for more sovereign AI projects out of the Gulf, with U.S. chipmakersespecially those outside the Big Tech orbitwell-positioned to benefit. For investors, this isn't just a data center buildout.

"AMD Rises 31% in One Month: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock?",1747405800000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have soared 31.4% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 19.4% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 22.5%.The outperformance can be attributed to AMD’s expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base. The strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success.So, how should you play the AMD stock now? Let’s dig deep to find out.AMD's One Month PerformanceAMD’s Expanding Portfolio Aids ProspectAMD’s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. In April 2025, AMD announced that Alphabet's GOOGL cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, has introduced new C4D and H4D virtual machines powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. Alphabet’s Google Cloud’s C4D instances deliver up to 80% higher throughput per vCPU, while Google Cloud’s H4D VMs offer scalable performance for HPC workloads with Cloud RDMA. These advancements underscore Google Cloud’s commitment to leveraging AMD’s Zen 5 architecture for enhanced cloud computing capabilities.AMD’s expanding portfolio in the embedded market has been a key catalyst for growth. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD introduced the EPYC Embedded 9005 Series processors, offering server-grade performance and energy efficiency, along with purpose-built features tailored for the networking, storage, and industrial edge markets.Rich Partner Base & Acquisitions to Boost AMD’s ProspectsA rich partner base that includes Alphabet, Oracle ORCL, Meta Platforms, Dell Technologies, Cisco Systems, Jio Platforms, Nokia and IBM has been playing a key part in expanding AMD’s footprint.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud, expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. AMD announced that its 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors now power Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute E6 Standard shapes. Oracle utilizes these processors to deliver up to 2X the performance of the previous generation at the same cost.AMD expanded its partnership with Dell Technologies to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure. In the reported quarter, AMD announced its collaboration with Dell Technologies to deliver AI-ready solutions for the telecom industry, featuring the Instinct MI300X accelerator to power scalable, high-performance network infrastructures.AMD is also benefiting from accretive acquisitions to strengthen its AI ecosystem and bridge the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the race for AI dominance. Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveDespite an expanding portfolio and a rich partner base, AMD is expected to be hurt by export restrictions on GPUs to China, which will be a headwind and stiff competition from NVIDIA.AMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%. AMD expects approximately $700 million reduction in second-quarter 2025 revenues due to halted MI308X shipments to China.AMD’s Earnings Estimates Trend DownwardThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s second-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, which has decreased 35% over the past 30 days, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.80%.The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $7.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.99%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.30%.AMD Stock OvervaluedAMD stock is currently overvalued, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.The stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.53X compared with the industry’s 3.31X.Price/Sales (F12M)Conclusion: Hold AMD Stock for NowAMD’s expanding portfolio, strategic acquisitions and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth. However, its near-term prospects are dull due to macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA in the cloud data center and AI chip markets. The growing demand for custom AI chips, offered by companies like Broadcom, is increasing concerns over market share. Stretched valuation also remains a concern. AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

Reduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern.Due to these headwinds, volumes are suffering. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) remains under pressure, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist. To combat the revenue weakness, UNP is looking to cut costs. In the meantime, UNP continues paying dividends.UNP is also active on the buyback front. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.

AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL.Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million.NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China.Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years.Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA?Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products.Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips.While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price.This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock.However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Markets Mostly Up on Mid-East Wheeling, Dealing",1747346880000,"Thursday, May 15, 2025Markets closed mostly up this session on moderately good news rippling through economic concerns throughout the day. With President Trump continuing his tour through the Middle East, we’re seeing a plethora of deals being made there with American corporations:Boeing BA will send more than 200 jets to Qatar Airways, $142 billion in military equipment investments will go to Saudi Arabia, billions more in Saudi infrastructure with supplies from AMD AMD, Cisco CSCO and others, and 18K AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA will be sent to a company chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.The Dow gained +271 points today, +0.65%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.52%. The Nasdaq, which has risen +13% over the past month, faltered this afternoon following news reports of an SEC investigation into Coinbase COIN and a cybersecurity hack, sending the stock down -7% today. Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks.

AMD's $6B Buyback And $10B AI Deal: A $16B Gambit to Catch Nvidia,1747338227000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD is making moves. Recently, the chipmaker announced a fresh $6 billion stock buyback, pushing its total repurchase firepower to $10 billion. The goal? Shrink share count, boost EPS, and restore investor confidence. AMD's latest $10 billion AI collaboration with Humain is a bold swing, but questions linger on how quickly that bet can pay off.CEO Lisa Su says the repurchase signals strong belief in AMD's strategic direction and long-term cash flow. But Q1 free cash flow was down over 33%to $727 millionand cash on hand now trails current liabilities. That doesn't leave a huge margin for error. Add to that fierce competition from Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA AI dominance and a wave of custom chipmakers, and AMD's runway feels tight. Still, reducing the share count could help shore up EPSespecially if future earnings stabilize or rebound.The bigger picture? The long-term chart shows AMD's EPS without non-recurring items steadily trending up. Despite stock price swings, earnings performance has been resilient.If buybacks kick in and AI execution improves, the stock could catch up to the fundamentals.

"Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy? ",1747335600000,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze. Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIA Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corporation BAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA? Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corporation MSFT is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corporation ORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"US tech firms Nvidia, AMD secure AI deals as Trump tours Gulf states",1747146903000,"A number of U.S. technology firms on Tuesday announced artificial intelligence deals in the Middle East as U.S. President Donald Trump secured $600 billion in commitments from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies during a tour of Gulf states.Among the biggest deals, Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a deal with Humain, saying it has formed a $10 billion collaboration. Another company to announce a deal with Humain, was Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ:QCOM , which said it signed a memo of understanding to develop and build a data centre central processor (CPU). The San Diego-based chip designer bought server CPU maker Nuvia in 2021 but has not yet released a product. Trump began his Gulf tour on Tuesday, kicking it off with the signing of a strategic economic agreement with Saudi Arabia as the oil power rolled out the red carpet. Trump's Middle East visit aims to drum up trillions of dollars in investments.The deals will flow both ways. The White House said Saudi Arabian firm DataVolt will invest $20 billion in AI data centres and energy infrastructure in the United States. Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google, DataVolt, Oracle Corp NYSE:ORCL , Salesforce Inc NYSE:CRM , Advanced Micro Devices and Uber NYSE:UBER will invest $80 billion in cutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries, the White House said, without giving details.Trump plans to visit the UAE on Thursday. The New York Times on Monday reported that the Trump administration is nearing a deal to allow UAE to buy large volumes of Nvidia's AI chips.Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and a leading centre for AI activity outside the United States.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday launched Humain to develop and manage AI technologies in Saudi Arabia.AI CHIP DEALSNvidia and Humain said they will leverage Nvidia's platforms to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in AI, GPU cloud computing and digital transformation.In a joint statement, the two companies said they will build AI factories with up to 500 megawatts of capacity that will include ""several hundred thousand"" of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs over five years.In Humain's deal with AMD, the agreement includes a plan to invest up to $10 billion to deploy 500 megawatts of AI hardware infrastructure over five years. The Humain-AMD deal, in addition to hardware purchases, involves a collaboration that aims to help Humain implement a next-generation AI cloud computing platform, according to Keith Strier, AMD senior vice president of global AI markets. ""Together, we are building a globally significant AI platform that delivers performance, openness and reach at unprecedented levels,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said in a statement.With some capacity set to come online in 2026, Humain will oversee the delivery of the data-crunching power to potential customers, while AMD will provide CPUs, GPUs and its software that helps orchestrate the data crunching. Part of the rationale for closing a deal with AMD is to ensure Humain isn't locked into using a single vendor for AI-related hardware, Strier said. ""And now, in addition to building infrastructure, countries recognize they need to do it in a very resilient way, in these diverse ways,"" Strier said. Chaired by bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Humain will operate under the Public Investment Fund and will offer AI services and products, including data centres, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models.""In building an AI company, you need the foundation and the infrastructure,"" Humain CEO Tareq Amin said on stage from Riyadh on Tuesday. ""It's a really, really big initiative for the kingdom.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL0P5:0-us-tech-firms-nvidia-amd-secure-ai-deals-as-trump-tours-gulf-states/"

Oracle Healthcare AI Advances: Should You Buy the Stock Now or Wait?,1747319460000,"Oracle ’s ORCL recent announcement of its Health Clinical AI Agent represents a significant advancement in its broader push to embed AI capabilities across its product portfolio. The company has unveiled a multimodal voice and screen-driven assistant that helps physicians reduce documentation time by approximately 30%, addressing the critical issue of clinician burnout in healthcare settings.AI Innovation Driving Healthcare TransformationOracle Health Clinical AI Agent combines generative AI, agentic technology, automation, and simplified workflows into a unified solution that integrates directly with Oracle's electronic health record systems. Already deployed across 40 medical specialties, the solution has facilitated the creation of nearly a million notes while enabling healthcare providers to access critical patient information through natural voice commands.The healthcare AI announcement aligns with statements made by Oracle CTO Larry Ellison during the recent third-quarter earnings call, where he highlighted the company's AI agent development. ""We have built lots of AI agents on top of Oracle databases and made those agents a part of our applications, modernizing and automating our applications,"" Ellison noted, specifically mentioning healthcare as a sector where Oracle's AI agents provide significant differentiation.Financial Performance Reveals Mixed SignalsOracle's third-quarter fiscal 2025 results showed both strengths and challenges. The company reported total revenues of $14.1 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year increase in USD and 8% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenues grew to $11 billion, up 12% in constant currency, while cloud infrastructure revenues increased 51%.Particularly impressive was Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which surged 63% year over year to $130 billion. CEO Safra Catz emphasized this metric as a leading indicator of future revenue growth, projecting a 15% increase in overall revenues for fiscal 2026 and approximately 20% for fiscal 2027.However, Oracle reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.47 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 0.68%. Revenues of $14.13 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%, disappointing investors’ enthusiasm for the company’s ascendant cloud business. The company's cloud license and on-premise license revenues declined 10% year over year (down 8% at cc) to $1.12 billion.Oracle trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 21.06x, substantially above the Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 16.6x. This premium valuation suggests that investors have already priced in exceptional future growth — growth that Oracle is increasingly struggling to deliver with modest revenue increases of just 6% year over year (8% in constant currency).ORCL’s EV/EBITDA TTM Ratio Depicts Premium ValuationThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.2% over the past 30 days.Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.Cloud Infrastructure Momentum Builds Against CompetitorsOracle's cloud infrastructure business has become a standout performer, with OCI consumption revenues increasing 57%. The company reached a milestone with its 101st cloud region coming online, positioning it to potentially surpass all competitors' combined cloud regions in the near future.The company has attracted major technology players like Advanced Micro Devices AMD, CrowdStrike CRWD and Palo Alto Networks PANW to its cloud platform, while also making significant inroads with hyperscalers through its Database@Cloud service offering, which grew 200% in the last quarter.However, during its latest earnings call, Oracle acknowledged that component delays have hampered cloud capacity expansion — a significant admission for a company positioning itself as a critical infrastructure provider for AI workloads. At a time when competitors like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google Cloud are rapidly scaling their infrastructure to meet surging AI demand, Oracle's supply chain challenges represent a competitive disadvantage that could cost it critical market share.With a 2.2% decline in the year-to-date period, ORCL has underperformed both the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500, which dropped 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively.Year-to-date PerformanceInvestment Outlook: Wait for a Better Entry PointDespite Oracle's impressive cloud growth and AI strategy, investors may want to exercise caution in the near term. The company currently trades at elevated valuation multiples relative to historical norms, while facing potential headwinds from component supply chain issues that have temporarily constrained cloud capacity expansion.While the backlog of $130 billion provides strong visibility into future growth, the company indicated that component delays have slowed cloud capacity expansion, potentially limiting near-term revenue conversion. Safra Catz noted that these constraints should ease in first-quarter fiscal 2026, which suggests that better growth acceleration may materialize later in 2025.Oracle's heavy capital expenditures, expected to exceed $16 billion for fiscal 2025, will pressure free cash flow in the immediate future. The trailing 12-month free cash flow of $5.8 billion represents a 53% year-over-year decline, primarily due to strategic infrastructure investments.Given these mixed signals, investors may find better entry points later in 2025 as cloud capacity constraints ease and the significant investments in AI infrastructure begin to generate stronger returns. The long-term thesis remains compelling, but patience could yield more attractive valuation opportunities for this cloud and AI transformation story. Oracle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia.

U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to address AI chip smuggling,1747314000000,"A bipartisan group of eight U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill on Thursday that would require makers of artificial intelligence chips such as Nvidia to include technology to verify the location of their chips before exporting them.The Chip Security Act introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to address reports of U.S. export-controlled AI chips being smuggled into China. U.S. officials across presidential administrations have sought to clamp down on their export to China, but Reuters and other news organizations have documented how some of those chips have continued to flow.""In order for the United States to maintain our technological advantage, we must employ safeguards to help ensure export controls are not being circumvented, allowing these advanced AI chips to fall into the hands of nefarious actors,"" Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who introduced the House bill, said in a statement.Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, introduced a similar bill in the U.S. Senate last week.The House bill was co-led by Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat, who was a physicist before becoming a legislator and designed several of his own chips during his scientific career. ""I know that we have the technical tools to prevent powerful AI technology from getting into the wrong hands,"" Foster said in a statement.The House bill comes after President Donald Trump's administration rescinded a rule enacted by predecessor President Joe Biden that would have regulated the flow of advanced AI chips around the world. The Trump administration has not yet announced a replacement rule.But Trump this week toured the Middle East, where he announced a spate of deals to send AI chips to countries in the Middle East, despite growing opposition from some inside the U.S. government. In addition to Foster and Huizenga, also co-leading the House bill are House Select Committee on China Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat.

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

20 stocks of companies showing excellent earnings-season trends even as the economy cools,1747063080000,"By Philip van DoornCompanies showing rapid sales growth and improving profit margins include Eli Lilly, Micron, AMD and NewmontEvery quarter during earnings season it can be useful to see which companies have improved their profit margins while also increasing their revenue. With U.S. economic growth turning negative during the first quarter, this earnings season's results might shed some light on which companies may best weather the disruption brought about by President Donald Trump's ""liberation day"" tariffs announced on April 2.Below is a screen of companies in the S&P 500 SPX that have fared best this earnings season.On April 30, Christine Idzelis explained that an increase of inventories contributed to the contraction of the U.S. real gross domestic product during the first quarter, as companies anticipated the tariffs.Because the new tariffs were announced in early April, second-quarter results might provide a more drastic comparison, depending on how much spending habits have changed. But the reversal from a 2.4% GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter to a slight contraction in the first quarter may have been enough to make for some difficult year-over-year comparisons of quarterly results.Screening for earnings-season winnersOne problem with an earnings-season screen is that about 20% of companies in the S&P 500 have fiscal reporting periods that don't match the calendar. This means there is no clear end to earnings season. Through Friday, 450 companies, or 90% of the S&P 500, had reported results for fiscal quarters that ended Feb. 15 or later. And the results for this group showed a slight decline in sales growth, but also improved efficiency.This is how we screened the 450 companies:- Increased quarterly sales per share from the year-earlier quarter. We screened for changes in sales per share rather than raw revenue, because the per-share numbers incorporated any dilution to a company's stock if it issued shares to raise money or to help finance the acquisition of another company. Sales will rise if a company acquires a competitor, but the per-share figure illustrates how much of that increase is ""available"" to investors who held the acquiring company's stock before the new shares were issued. On the other hand, sales per share will increase more rapidly than revenue if a company lowers its share count by repurchasing stock. All per-share figures are adjusted by FactSet for any stock splits. - Improved gross profit margins. A company's gross margin is its net sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. Net sales are sales minus returns and discounts, such as coupons. The cost of goods or services sold includes the actual expenses when making the items or providing the services. Gross margin is a measurement of pricing power and core efficiency. - Improved operating margins. A company's operating margin incorporates more overhead and other expenses that aren't directly related to the production of goods and services. It can be summarized as earnings before interest and taxes, divided by sales.Profit margins vary by industry. For example, auto manufacturers will be expected to have lower gross margins than mature software companies. So comparisons may be most useful between companies with similar business models.A combination of sales growth and improving gross and operating margins is a good sign for any company. It indicates the company isn't being forced to offer discounts to defend its market share.Among the 450 companies we screened, gross and operating margins were available for 404 of them. These figures aren't available for many companies in the financial sector, because banks and insurers have their own industry-based measures of profitability. For a handful of companies, operating margins weren't available for the most recent reported quarters because the companies' earnings press releases didn't include enough information for FactSet to calculate the margins. These calculations must wait until full 10-Q reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Among the 404 companies subject to the screen:- 75% reported increased quarterly sales per share from the year-earlier quarter. That was down from 80% showing year-over-year increases the previous quarter. - 55% showed improved quarterly gross margins from the year-earlier quarter. That was up from 47% showing year-over-year improvement the previous quarter. - 58% improved their quarterly operating margins, which was up from 56% the previous quarter.Improvements on two out of the three metrics make first-quarter earnings season look very good for the S&P 500, despite the economic disruption from the tariffs.To narrow down the list, here are the 20 companies showing the largest increases in sales per share while also improving their gross and operating margins:Click on the tickers for more about each company.Read: Tomi Kilgore's detailed guide to the information available on the MarketWatch quote pageExpand Energy (EXE) tops the list, with quarterly revenue per share more than doubling. The company was formerly Chesapeake Energy Corp. and began operating under its current name when it acquired Southwestern Energy Co. in October.Eli Lilly (LLY) ranks fourth on the list, with sales per share rising nearly 46%. On Sunday the company announced results of clinical trials of its Zepbound GLP-1 weight-loss medication that it said showed ""superiority compared to Wegovy,"" a rival medication made by Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO).Through Friday, Newmont (NEM) was the best-performing stock on this list for 2025, with a year-to-date gain of 46% with dividends reinvested, as the price of continuous front-month gold contracts (GC00) on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 27% to $3,344 an ounce. But gold was down 3% and Newmont's stock was down 5% early Monday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a preliminary deal between the U.S. and China to lower tariffs.Don't miss: How high-yield bond funds like these can lower your investment risk-Philip van DoornThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Influence NVIDIA’s Q1 ResultsNVIDIA’s first-quarter top line is likely to have benefited from the continued strength in its Datacenter business. The increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is anticipated to have boosted demand for its chips across the datacenter end market. An increase in hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have acted as tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.The Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $38.5 billion, which indicates robust year-over-year growth of 70.6%.Moreover, NVIDIA’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s results have improved year over year in six out of the last seven quarters, as inventory levels with channel partners have returned to normal. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market is pegged at $3.29 billion, which implies a 24.4% increase from the year-ago quarter’s level.NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing in six consecutive quarters. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter. Our first-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $567.6 million, which suggests a 32.9% increase from the year-ago quarter’s figure.The company’s Automotive segment demonstrated an improvement in trends over the preceding four quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $551.7 million, which indicates year-over-year growth of 67.7%.NVIDIA Stock Price Performance & ValuationShares of NVIDIA have remained highly volatile over the past year. NVDA stock has gained 27% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s growth of 23.5%. The stock has also outperformed major semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology have lost 30.1%, 24% and 19.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value NVIDIA offers investors at the current levels. NVIDIA is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 15.48X compared with the industry’s 13.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.NVDA also trades at a premium compared with other semiconductor players, including Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology. Currently, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Marvell Technology trade at a forward P/S multiples of 5.37X, 2.48X and 5.94X, respectively.Investment Consideration for NVIDIAOver the past year, NVIDIA’s revenue growth has been driven by robust demand for chips required for the development of generative AI models. NVIDIA dominates the market for generative AI chips, which have already proven useful across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.The growing demand to modernize the workflow across industries is expected to drive the demand for generative AI applications.

"US close to letting UAE import millions of Nvidia's AI chips, sources say",1747255290000,"The U.S. has a preliminary agreement with the United Arab Emirates to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA most advanced AI chips per year, starting in 2025, two sources familiar with the situation said, boosting the Emirates' construction of data centers vital to developing artificial intelligence models. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agreement was at least through 2027, but that there was a chance it could be in place until 2030.The draft deal called for 20% of the chips, or 100,000 of them per year, to go to UAE's tech firm G42, while the rest would be split among U.S. companies with massive AI operations like Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Oracle NYSE:ORCL that might also seek to build data centers in the UAE, the sources said.They said the agreement is still being negotiated and could change before being finalized. One source said the deal, elements of which were first reported by the New York Times, faced growing opposition in the U.S. government over the past day. The Biden administration issued restrictions on AI chip exports to control the flow of the sophisticated processors worldwide, in part to keep the prized semiconductors from being diverted to China, where they could bolster Beijing's military.U.S. President Donald Trump this week is on a tour of the Gulf region and on Tuesday announced $600 billion worth of commitments from Saudi Arabia, including deals to buy large quantities of chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD and Qualcomm NASDAQ:QCOM . Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.The chips in the UAE deal that would go to G42 would represent a tripling or quadrupling, in terms of compute power, that would have been available to the UAE under rules put in place by the administration of former President Joe Biden. The Trump administration said last week it planned to rescind that regulation. At present, the vast majority of AI computing power is deployed in the United States and China. If all the proposed deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power center in global AI competition. The U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, did not have a comment. The White House, G42 and the United Arab Emirates did not have an immediate comment. Nvidia declined to comment.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, the UAE's ruling family and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42. The tech holding group's chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE national security adviser and brother of the Emirates' president.The preliminary agreement also aims to promote data centers in the U.S. It currently says that for every facility G42 builds in the UAE, it must build a similar one in the U.S., the sources said.One of the sources said the definition of what is an advanced AI chip would be figured out in a separate working group that will be created later, along with security requirements.The proposed numbers of chips are for the most advanced graphics processing units, one of the sources said. As of now, that could refer to Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are more powerful than the previous generation of Hopper chips, or Nvidia's forthcoming Rubin chips, which are more powerful than both of their predecessors.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM0V4:0-us-close-to-letting-uae-import-millions-of-nvidia-s-ai-chips-sources-say/"
"Semiconductor, Chip Stocks Rally on U.S.-China Trade Deal — Update",1747058640000,"By Dean Seal and Denny JacobShares of semiconductor and chip companies are moving higher after the U.S. and China agreed to dramatically scale back sky-high tariffs on each other's goods.Shares of Nvidia were up 3.9% at $121.15, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing shares rose 4.8% to $184.97. Shares of Qualcomm were up 3.6% at $150.36, while shares of Broadcom were up 4.9% at $218.45.The semiconductor sector has been under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war kicked off by the Trump administration this year. While President Trump didn't issue direct tariffs on chipmakers, most chips are exported to China or other countries where they are assembled into servers and computer equipment that were expected to face tariffs when shipped to the U.S.Chip companies saw similar gains in early trading Monday.

Does Broadcom's Expanding Portfolio Make the AVGO Stock a Buy?,1747844580000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have surged 37.2% in the past month. The company is benefiting from an expanding portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business, strong balance sheet and impressive free cash flow. Broadcom has outperformed its closest semiconductor peers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Marvell Technology MRVL, shares of which have returned 35.6%, 32.6% and 21%, respectively, over the same time frame.AVGO Stock’s PerformanceBroadcom’s strategy of updating its portfolio on a frequent basis has been a key catalyst. The company is expanding its portfolio with the launch of its third-generation 200G per lane (200G/lane) Co-Packaged Optics product line. In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C) This follows March showcase of 200G/lane DSP and SerDes, 400G optics, and PCIe Gen6 over optics products at the 2025 Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC). Strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C).

Palantir Stock Hits Another All-Time High. The AI Trade Is On Fire. — Barrons.com,1747248540000,"By Adam LevinePalantir stock touched its second all-time high of the week on Wednesday, reaching $133.49 in intraday trading, before pulling back slightly.Palantir is a stock given to sharp moves. It has been a particularly wild ride for Palantir shareholders since the company reported first-quarter earnings on May 5. While it was a strong quarter that beat analysts expectations, and included raised 2025 guidance, the stock fell 12% the next day to $108.86. It closed out last week at $117.30, and then rose to $128.10 on Tuesday, after touching an intraday high of $130.60.The stock's success has also been tied to broader market sentiment around artificial intelligence. The so-called AI trade has come storming back in recent weeks. The Trump administration's pullback on tariffs has restored investors' tolerance, and enthusiasm, for riskier growth stocks.Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined a group of tech leaders who accompanied President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia this week, where new AI deals were announced by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Amazon. Karp was likely there to talk about defense contracts.Palantir stock has been subject to ""on-again, off-again applause,"" on Wall Street, Barron's wrote in a recent feature on the company. ""The business has become the subject of great debate, ranging from Karp's views on Silicon Valley and politics to the scale of opportunity that lies ahead for the company's unique approach to software,"" Barron's wrote.Wall Street holds a wide range of views on the stock with analyst price targets currently ranging from $40 to $140.Since going public in September 2020, Palantir stock is up 1,262% for a 76% annualized return. The S&P 500 index has returned an annualized 11% over the same period.So far this year, Palantir stock is up 71%, versus flat performance for the large-cap index.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

TSMC Stock Rises as Sales Surge. What It Means for the AI Trade. — Barrons.com,1746799380000,"By Adam ClarkTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing sales are continuing to boom. It's a good sign for companies providing artificial-intelligence infrastructure, although some of the boost is likely being driven by fears of tariffs.Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, said Thursday its revenue for April came to 349.57 billion New Taiwan dollars, a 48% increase from the previous year and its highest ever monthly sales figure.The Taiwanese chip manufacturer didn't provide any detail on what drove the surge but it's probably safe to say it has plenty to do with AI hardware. TSMC previously said it expects revenue from AI-related servers and processors to double in 2025.TSMC is a crucial player in the AI-chip market. It's the main supplier of chips to Nvidia — the leader of semiconductors used for AI applications. TSMC also makes the core processors inside Apple iPhones, Qualcomm mobile chipsets, and processors made by Advanced Micro Devices.However, it's likely that the strength is slightly deceptive, as sales could be driven by customers buying chips before the potential imposition of tariffs. TSMC has continued to guide for mid-20% growth in sales this year, well below the 44% increase seen in the first four months of the year.President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested he is considering imposing tariffs on chips produced outside the U.S., and it isn't clear if TSMC would receive a waiver on such levies despite pledging a total of $165 billion in American investment.American depositary receipts of TSMC have dropped 11% this year as chip companies' shares succumbed to tariff turmoil. The ADRs were up 1.9% early on Friday.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AMD Sells ZT Fab Unit, Bolsters AI Talent to Challenge Nvidia",1747769807000,"AMD NASDAQ:AMD offloads ZT Systems' manufacturing arm for $3 billion while snapping up its 1,200-strong engineering team to sharpen its edge against Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA in the data-center GPU race. Citi Research analysts, led by Christopher Danely, note that last August's $4.6 billion ZT deal has been split: Sanmina will acquire the factory business for $2.55 billion in cash and stock plus $450 million in earn-outs, while AMD retains the engineers for roughly $1.6 billionabout $1.33 million apieceto accelerate hyperscaler deployments and bolster system-level expertise. Danely argues that additional system experience and faster deployment times should help AMD close the gap on Nvidia's market share.Under the agreement, Sanmina becomes AMD's preferred manufacturing partner for cloud-rack and cluster-scale AI solutions, reflecting a strategic pivot from in-house production to a fab-lite model. The transaction, expected to close near year-end 2025, underscores AMD's focus on high-margin chip design over capital-intensive fabs. Citi kept its Neutral rating and $100 price target on AMD, highlighting the balance between near-term dilution from the $1.6 billion engineering buyout and long-term gains from faster product rollouts.AMD, which derives roughly 30% of sales from PCs, faces stiff competition not only from Nvidia in AI GPUs but also from Intel NASDAQ:INTC in data-center CPUs. By beefing up its in-house design team and offloading manufacturing risk, AMD aims to streamline R&D investment and speed time to market for MI300 and future MI400 data-center accelerators.Why It Matters: Retaining ZT's engineering talent while outsourcing production could deliver faster hyperscaler deployments and help AMD narrow the performance and deployment gap with Nvidia's entrenched data-center GPU ecosystem.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1cbb17f0e094b:0-amd-sells-zt-fab-unit-bolsters-ai-talent-to-challenge-nvidia/

Buy the Spike in AMD Stock After Q1 Earnings?,1746734820000,"Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD stock has risen 5% since surpassing its Q1 expectations on Tuesday, with the post-earnings rally gaining steam as President Trump boosted markets by announcing a new trade deal with the United Kingdom.With Trump revisiting the rhetoric of keeping chip manufacturing dominance in the U.S., it’s certainly a worthy topic of whether now is a good time to buy AMD stock for more upside.AMD’s Consistency Continues Stating AMD delivered an outstanding start to the year despite evolving dynamics related to tariffs and the regulatory environment, CEO Lisa Su highlighted that the company’s growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter.Driven by Data Center and AI momentum, AMD’s Q1 sales spiked 36% to $7.43 billion compared to $5.47 billion a year ago, and topped estimates of $7.12 billion. Notably, AMD has surpassed top line expectations for 10 straight quarters. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS climbed 55% to $0.96 versus $0.62 a share in the prior year quarter. Exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus of $0.93, AMD has now reached or exceeded earnings expectations for 25 consecutive quarters. AMD’s Revenue Guidance Providing Q2 guidance, AMD expects revenue at $7.4 billion plus or minus $300 million, which would reflect 27% growth. This is on par with the current Zacks Consensus (Current Qtr Below) and includes an estimated $700 million revenue reduction from the new export license requirements for its MI308 AI accelerator chips to China, a modified version of its superior MI300X chip.For the full year, AMD estimates the revenue impact due to the export license requirement to be approximately $1.5 billion. Based on Zacks' estimates, AMD’s total sales are now expected to increase 21% in fiscal 2025 to $31.31 billion compared to $25.79 billion last year. Plus, FY26 sales are projected to rise another 19% to $37.17 billion. AMD Stock Performance Despite the post-earnings bump, AMD stock is still down 15% year to date, a steeper decline than the broader indexes and chip competitor Nvidia’s NVDA -12%. Over the last three years, AMD is only up +19%, trailing the market’s returns and Nvidia’s eye-popping gains of nearly +600%.Bottom Line Although AMD is currently the second-largest producer of AI GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) behind Nvidia, the excitement for its growth potential has worn off in recent years. For now, AMD stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q1 report.To that point, more upside may largely depend on the trend of earnings estimate revisions in the coming weeks as analysts digest the impact that tariffs will have on the chipmaker. This includes the export license requirements, as the ongoing trade war with China plays out.

Nvidia and 29 Other Stocks to Play AI — Barrons.com,1746732720000,"By Teresa RivasWhile tariffs have caused tech stocks to bend, they won't break, a longtime bull says. It's all thanks to artificial intelligence.The technology sector has been one of the harder-hit areas during the 2025 market downturn. Even as stocks have started to rebound amid hopes for tariff negotiations, the Nasdaq Composite is still down more than 8% year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's loss, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund is off some 13%.Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that tech's underdog status won't last. Perhaps most obviously, the artificial intelligence genie can't be put back in the bottle. AI is becoming increasingly mainstream, whether it's people talking to chatbots, retailers using it to personalize their promotional efforts, or companies hoping to improve efficiency and productivity.In short, the AI revolution will continue to play out for years to come. That's the stance of Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime tech bull. He calls AI the fourth industrial revolution in a new note Thursday, arguing that ""it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.""That creates an opportunity for multiple companies — and their investors — to win. He highlights 30 tech companies that he says will be long-term winners across six areas: hyperscalers, software, consumer internet, cybersecurity, autonomous and robotics, and semiconductors and hardware.Often thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" of AI, semiconductors and hardware makers are the second largest group in his list. They have also been some of the most well-known AI beneficiaries, including Nvidia — Ives calls co-founder Jensen Huang the ""godfather of AI.""Naturally Ives still likes the stock, along with Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. He says AMD will continue to strengthen its position and gain market share, and Taiwan Semi — the world's leading chip foundry — will make it a beneficiary of the global increase in AI investments. In addition, Micron has ""an enviable position within memory,"" while Broadcom, the world leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cloud and AI, will benefit from the buildout of these technologies.More than 15% of cloud services now include some AI component, making hyperscalers another area of huge investments. Major companies in the space ""are expected to spend $325 billion+ in 2025 through AI capital expenditures, representing 40% year-over-year growth and over $100 billion year-over-year increase as data center buildouts continue with the AI Arms Race only just beginning,"" Ives writes."" Microsoft is currently in the driver's seat,"" he says, adding that Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, and Oracle aren't far behind.With both people and businesses ramping up their use of AI, consumer internet companies stand to benefit, too, Ives says. Positives could include AI customer service, to improved search, personalization of ads, and dynamic pricing.His favorite picks stateside are Apple — he estimates about a quarter of the world's population will eventually access AI through an Apple device — and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is still seeing strong underlying demand. Among Chinese stocks, he highlights Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu. It's becoming ""clearer [Alibaba] could be one of the winners in the China AI Arms Race,"" he writes, while Baidu is another major Chinese player poised to do well.Robotics is another key area, as the ""global autonomous vehicle market size is expected to reach $3.22 trillion by 2033 representing a 36% compound annual growth rate,"" Ives writes. Tesla's robo-taxis earn it a spot here, while nuclear energy start-up Oklo will help meet the increasing power demands of automation.Of course, all of these advancements make cybersecurity more important than ever. Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and CyberArk Software are his picks here.Software is the largest category, as 1 billion apps will be with generative AI by 2028, Ive says, noting ""the software era of AI use cases [is] already under way."" Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, IBM, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Adobe, Pegasystems, MongoDB, C3.ai, Elastic, Innodata, and SoundHound are on his list of winners.Tariffs remain a worry, though Ives predicts they won't dent the AI revolution in the long run.He isn't the only optimist on this front. 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere writes Thursday that investors will likely return to megacap tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven because the U.S. economy will likely avoid a recession, though it might slow.""High-quality, monopolistic companies with strong earnings momentum are favorable in our base case of an economic muddle through, especially after large price drawdowns,"" he writes.Time to ask ChatGPT if tech is cheap enough to buy the dip.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

AMD vs. Lattice Semiconductor: Which FPGA Stock Has the Edge?,1747244100000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Lattice Semiconductor LSCC are major players in the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) market. AMD entered this space through its acquisition of Xilinx, while LSCC specializes in low-power FPGAs for applications like industrial automation and edge computing.Per the Mordor intelligence report, the FPGA Market size is projected to be valued at $11.14 billion in 2025. It is expected to reach $18.76 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 10.98% during the forecast period of 2025-2030. AMD and LSCC are likely to benefit from the significant growth opportunity highlighted by the rapid pace of growth.So, AMD or LSCC — Which of these FPGA stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.The Case for AMDAdvanced Micro Devices’ acquisition of Xilinx has helped expand into multiple embedded markets, which primarily include embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules and adaptive SoC products.The acquisition of Xilinx has helped AMD to consistently push the boundaries of capacity in emulation devices, with each generation nearly doubling its capabilities. The latest VP1902 adaptive SoC offers an impressive 18.5 million logic cells, doubling the programmable logic density of the previous generation Virtex UltraScale+ VU19P FPGA. AMD’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD announced the availability of a high-performance, energy-efficient 5G core powered by the Virtex UltraScale+ XCVU5P FPGA, developed in collaboration with Napatech and Druid Software.AMD also completed its initial shipments of cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale Plus FPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge SoCs during the first quarter, meeting the growing demand for AI at the Edge.AMD is also actively expanding its partnerships with major cloud providers, such as AWS, and incorporating its products into new FPGA-accelerated instances. In the first quarter of 2025, AWS launched FPGA-accelerated instances powered by AMD’s EPYC processors and Xilinx Virtex FPGAs. These instances are optimized for data-intensive workloads such as genomics, multimedia processing, and cloud-based video broadcasting.The Case for LSCCLattice Semiconductor is benefiting from strong demand for its small and mid-range FPGA solutions. The company has continued to expand its footprint in this market, particularly with its Nexus and Avant product families. This has enabled the company to capitalize on new opportunities in high-growth industries.Building on this momentum, Lattice has positioned its FPGAs in high-growth applications, including AI, data centers, and advanced driver-assistance systems in automotive, along with other emerging markets, such as security, including Post-Quantum Cryptography and AR/VR in consumer markets. Further strengthening its position in February 2025, the company announced the successful validation of Everspin Technologies' PERSYST Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) for use across all of Lattice’s Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).This collaboration aims to enhance MRAM’s suitability for mission-critical applications, including real-time sensor processing, data logging in avionics, and in-orbit reprogramming for space systems.Price Performance and Valuation of AMD and LSCCYear to date, shares of AMD and LSCC have lost 6.9% and 1.4%, respectively. The dip in AMD and LSCC share prices can be attributed to the challenging macroeconomic environment. A broader market weakness in the tech sector and persistent fear over mounting tariffs have added to the pressure. AMD and LSCC Stock's PerformanceValuation-wise, AMD and LSCC shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of D and F. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AMD shares are trading at 5.41X, which is lower than LSCC's 13.91X.AMD and LSCC ValuationHow Do Earnings Estimates Compare for AMD & LSCC?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.09 per share, which has declined 10% over the past 30 days, indicating a 23.56% increase year over year.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LSCC’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.05 per share, which has decreased 4.5% over the past 30 days, indicating a 16.67% increase year over year.Lattice Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusLattice Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | Lattice Semiconductor Corporation QuoteAMD earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 2.30%. LSCC earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and were in line with the other two, delivering a negative average earnings surprise of 6.31%.ConclusionAMD’s strong portfolio expansion and partnerships position it for robust growth in the FPGA market, while LSCC’s focus on low-power solutions continues to capture emerging opportunities. However, AMD’s valuation and earnings estimates suggest it may offer greater upside potential than LSCC.Currently, AMD has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick than LSCC, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:363c7b408094b:0-amd-vs-lattice-semiconductor-which-fpga-stock-has-the-edge/
"Sam Altman, Tech Execs Push Congress for Backing in AI Race Against China — Barrons.com",1746724200000,"By Angela PalumboThe U.S. is currently beating China in the AI race, but it is ""very hard to say how far ahead we are,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Thursday.He was among a group of tech executives testifying at a Senate committee hearing, held by Sen. Ted Cruz, titled ""Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation."" AMD CEO Lisa Su, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator, and Microsoft President Brad Smith were also testifying.American politicians have been open about their desire to see the U.S. beat China in the AI race. Cruz asked the panel during the testimony if the U.S. is currently winning. Altman said he believes American models, like OpenAI, are the ""best models in the world,"" but that it is difficult to judge how far behind China is.Su responded to the question by saying even though the U.S. has the ""best AI accelerators in the world,"" China is ""certainly catching up.""""Relative to what we can do, I will continue to say: Really ensure that our spirit of innovation is allowed to work,"" Su added. ""And that is having very supportive government policies to do that, having very consistent policies, and allowing us to do what we do best, which is innovate at every layer of the stack.""The AI hearing was also meant to look at how removing regulatory barriers in AI can ""secure U.S. dominance in the 21(st) century global industrial revolution.""Altman's testimony focused on the importance of AI in the future of the American workforce.""This future can be almost unimaginably bright, but only if we take concrete steps to ensure that an American-led version of AI, built on democratic values like freedom and transparency, prevails over an authoritarian one,"" Altman said in prepared remarks. ""The stakes couldn't be higher — and Congress is right that the United States must lead the way.""During his opening remarks, Altman also took the opportunity to say that usership of OpenAI's ChatGPT is taking off. He said that ChatGPT is being used by more than 500 million people each week, which is 100 million more than management said were using the platform each week back in February.This comes one day after an Apple executive testified in a Justice Department lawsuit against Google that searches in Apple browsers fell for the first time as people turned to AI for their search needs. Alphabet stock tumbled on Wednesday as investors feared AI would take market share from what has been the search king.Alphabet stock regained some ground on Thursday after the company said it is seeing ""overall query growth in Search.""Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Chips Stocks Rise as U.S. Plans to Overhaul Curbs on AI Chip Exports,1746716580000,"By Kelly CloonanChip stocks rose across the board as the Trump administration plans to overhaul export regulations on U.S. chip companies.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.8% to $104.20 on Thursday. Intel rose 2.3%, while Qualcomm and Broadcom both ticked up around 1%. Nvidia shares remained flat.The Commerce Department plans to replace a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips countries like India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel can buy, a spokeswoman said.The rule, commonly known as AI diffusion, had been set to go into effect May 15. It aimed to prevent other countries from routing U.S. chips to adversaries like China, but was seen as controversial across the tech industry. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle argued it would harm American companies' business prospects abroad without doing much to hinder China.Other regulations appear to remain for now, though. The Trump administration recently issued new export-licensing requirements covering Nvidia's H20 chips, which the company said would result in a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings.

AMD’s AI-Powered Stock Price Rally Just Shifted Gears,1747238700000,"Advanced Micro Devices' NASDAQ:AMD long-awaited AI-powered stock price rally is here. The stock is rocketing higher after a string of good news, including reduced trade tensions with China, a new deal with Saudi Arabia’s HUMAIN, and a new $6 billion share buyback authorization. The authorization, a sign of the board's confidence in future free cash flow , is worth an additional $6 billion on top of the $4 billion left under the existing. The total $10 billion in potential share repurchases is worth about 5.5% of the market cap in mid-May and a potentially strong tailwind. It is potentially strong because repurchase activity in 2024 failed to reduce the count, stock-based compensation awards more than offset their impact and may do so again in 2025. However, the first quarter results included a slight reduction in the diluted count that may persist and even accelerate as the year progresses.Other figures that investors should be watching are the cash, assets, and equity, which are all increasing. The company’s Q1 balance sheet highlights included a 50% YOY increase in cash , increased receivables and inventory , steady debt levels , and reduced liability . The net result was a 5% increase in equity and an expectation for equity gains to accelerate as the year progresses. The outlook for the year was amplified by recent news, including a $10 billion deal with HUMAIN. HUMAIN, Saudi Arabia’s newly formed AI enterprise, inked a $10 billion deal for AI infrastructure backed by President Trump. The deal involves 500 megawatts of AI compute capacity using AMD's most advanced semiconductor technology and is expected to play out over five years.The impact on AMD's outlook is significant and worth 3100 basis points of revenue growth relative to the 2025 consensus forecast reported by MarketBeat. Analysts Cheer Eye-Opening Moment for AI Investors The analyst's response to the Saudi news was overwhelmingly bullish. Bank of America analysts view Advanced Micro Devices as a top-winner alongside NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , while the Dan Ives-led Wedbush team called it an eye-opening moment . They view the deal and the others announced alongside it as a clear signal that Saudi Arabia will be a significant player in AI for years to come.Saudi Arabia's AI investment could top $1 trillion within years and open the door to expanding possibilities for all things AI. Ultimately, the factor that matters is that the analyst group is  lifting price targets again and leading to the high-end range, a gain of 50% relative to mid-May trading levels. Advanced Micro Devices' upcoming Q2 earnings release, scheduled for late July, will be a market-moving event for this stock. Not only is there a high probability that the company will outperform its consensus estimates for revenue and earnings, but the guidance will likely be strong .Demand was strong before the Saudi deal and will only increase in its wake. The risk is China. The curb on exports to China will impact the results, but may be limited. Saudi Arabia will make up for the lost revenue.Advanced Micro Devices Stock Price Reaches a Critical Pivot PointAdvanced Micro Devices' stock price advanced by 15% within two days of the HUMAIN announcement and will likely continue to move higher. However, there is a risk of resistance at a critical pivot point, including the long-term 30-week EMA, representing institutional buy-and-hold investors.If the market is unable to get above the level quickly, there is a risk that AMD’s share price will remain range-bound at current levels. A move above the 30-week EMA would be a bullish sign, indicating  improved market sentiment and an all-clear to investors . The market for AMD stock would likely move up to $147.50 soon after and potentially continue rising through the year’s end. Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:0f5677575094b:0-amd-s-ai-powered-stock-price-rally-just-shifted-gears/
Nvidia Stock Wavers as Trump Plans to Scrap Biden's Chip-Export Rules — Barrons.com,1746716340000,"Adam ClarkNvidia and other semiconductor stocks were rising Thursday as the Trump administration said it plans to scrap regulations that would limit exports of artificial-intelligence chips worldwide.Nvidia shares were down 0.3% at $116.71 in Thursday morning trading, after gaining more than 3% the previous day.

The curbs were set to go into effect on May 15 and would have limited sales more widely than existing sanctions on exports to China.The so-called ""AI diffusion"" rules were expected to reduce the long-term market for AI chips by as much as 10%, according to analysts at BofA Securities.""We welcome the administration's leadership and new direction on AI policy. With the AI Diffusion Rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, "" Nvidia said in an emailed statement.However, it isn't clear if the overhaul will lead to alternative rules on chip exports, which could potentially be even more onerous. The White House has considered including AI-processor limits as part of bilateral agreements with individual countries, according to the report.More information could come with President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Middle East next week, where AI chip exports are likely to be on the agenda.""We generally expect that Trump will increase the total of chips allowed to be sold globally, starting with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but this could also come with more enforcement to prevent the diversion of banned chips to China,"" wrote Raymond James analyst Ed Mills in a research note.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AI execs say US must increase exports, improve infrastructure to beat China",1746714728000,"Top executives at American AI giants OpenAI, Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD said at a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday that while the U.S. is ahead in the artificial-intelligence race, Washington needs to boost infrastructure and champion AI chip exports to stay ahead of Beijing.The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, is looking to cut regulatory barriers to U.S. artificial intelligence after China's DeepSeek shocked the world with a high-quality, affordable AI model last year and as Huawei, long in Washington's crosshairs, unveiled an advanced AI chip.The U.S. tech industry has seized on those concerns to lobby the Trump administration for more favorable policies including loosened export restrictions on AI chips, arguing that promoting worldwide use of AI that reflects democratic values is a matter of national interest.""The number-one factor that will define whether the U.S. or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith, adding that concerns about Chinese propaganda and personal data flows to China had driven his own company to bar employees from using DeepSeek.""The lesson from Huawei and 5G is that whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant,"" he said.The Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, which also makes an advanced AI chip, has faced U.S. restrictions over concerns its equipment could be used to spy on users. Reuters reported last month that Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] is ramping up to make mass shipments of advanced AI chips to Chinese customers.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, maker of flagship AI model ChatGPT, and Lisa Su, CEO of AI chipmaker AMD, also testified at the hearing.Altman told the panel he expects societal advances from AI to accelerate in the next few years through U.S. innovation, but that ""investment in infrastructure is critical.""Such infrastructure includes everything from data centers to house more servers to power stations that fuel the energy-intensive calculations needed to drive AI. In addition, Microsoft's Smith called for more education on AI to speed up adoption, training to increase the number of electricians, and support for AI research and development.DeepSeek, a Hangzhou-based upstart, stunned the world last year when it unveiled a powerful AI model competitive with the likes of OpenAI and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , but cheaper to run.The move was surprising against the backdrop of sweeping rules imposed by former President Joe Biden's administration, aimed at cutting off China from American AI chips and capabilities, over fears Beijing could use the powerful technology to supercharge its military.The Trump administration has so far taken a similar approach, last month imposing new licensing requirements on shipments to China of AI chips made by Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and AMD that the companies designed to get around prior export restrictions.But the Trump administration also plans to rescind and replace a set of AI chip export curbs unveiled during the waning days of the Biden administration, which were set to take effect on May 15. Cruz, Su and Altman all applauded the decision at the hearing. ""The Biden administration's misguided midnight AI diffusion rule on chips and model weights would have crippled American tech companies' ability to sell AI to the world,"" Cruz said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RG0RF:0-ai-execs-say-us-must-increase-exports-improve-infrastructure-to-beat-china/"

AMD stock rallies on stock buyback announcement: find out more,1747234829000,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc NASDAQ:AMD is pushing significantly to the upside this morning after announcing a material increase to its share repurchase authorisation.On Wednesday, the company’s board authorised another $6 billion worth of buybacks, reflecting “confidence in AMD’s strategic direction, growth prospects and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow.”The chipmaker is now authorised to repurchase about $10 billion worth of its stock in total. AMD’s extended program “has no termination date,” as per its press release today.At the time of writing, AMD shares are up more than 50% versus their low in early April.Why is the buyback announcement significant for AMD stock?AMD choosing to expand its existing buyback program is a meaningful development for investors, given repurchases often suggest the management currently sees the stock as undervalued. Additionally, buybacks decrease the number of outstanding shares, which can trigger an increase in earnings per share. A higher EPS tends to attract investors and strengthen the company’s stock price.Share repurchase initiatives are positive also because they create buying pressure, helping stabilise a firm’s stock price during volatile markets. AMD stock has been in a sharp uptrend in recent weeks as the Trump administration continued to sign trade agreements with global leaders. Most recently, the White House even agreed to a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China as well.Still, Advanced Micro Devices shares are down more than 8.0% versus their YTD high at writing.AMD has secured a sizable deal from Saudi ArabiaInvestors are cheering AMD stock also because the chipmaker has recently inked a multi-year AI infrastructure deal with Humain – a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund.The said collaboration will “deploy up to 500 megawatts of AI infrastructure, powered by the full spectrum of AMD compute,” as per the multinational’s press release on Wednesday.The Saudi agreement made Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya raise his price target on Advanced Micro Devices in a research note this morning to $130.His upwardly revised price target on AMD shares represents potential upside of another 9.0% from here.Why is Bank of America bullish on AMD shares?BofA is positive on AMD stock as “Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investment with a focus on training and inference of LLMs in local culture, language, and needs.”Plus, it could help boost power availability for data centres in the US as well, BofA analyst Vivek Arya told clients in a research note on Wednesday.Note that the Kingdom, more broadly, has recently pledged up to $600 billion worth of investments in the US.That said, the AI stock remains unattractive for income investors since it does not currently pay a dividend.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:32e4c645e094b:0-amd-stock-rallies-on-stock-buyback-announcement-find-out-more/
Arm shares slump as weak forecasts fuel investor worries,1746702602000,"Arm NASDAQ:ARM shares sank 9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the chip technology provider issued a weak revenue forecast and joined other semiconductor companies in warning about a hit from tariffs-driven economic uncertainty.The move aligns Arm with companies such as Apple NASDAQ:AAPL and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD , which have flagged additional costs due to the U.S.-China tariff war hurting tech supply chains.Arm derives revenue from licensing fees for its chip designs and collects a royalty for each chip sold that uses its technology.Its revenue faces a threat as smartphones, which use its designs, grapple with slower sales as prices rise due to tariffs. Counterpoint Research said in April it expects the smartphone market to decline this year due to economic uncertainty from tariffs.""Royalties will likely face tariff-driven end demand headwinds, offset somewhat by Arm's strong pricing/royalty rate inflation,"" Citigroup analysts said in a note.To offset the demand fluctuations with smartphones, Arm has been trying to make inroads into artificial intelligence data centers. Arm CEO Rene Haas told Reuters the below-expectations guidance is due to a large licensing deal that may not close during the fiscal first quarter.""We remain engaged on the LT (long-term) story, but caution that the high consumer exposure leaves the company particularly vulnerable to the macro,"" Barclays analysts said.At least three brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, bringing the median to $144.5, according to data compiled by LSEG.ARM shares trade at 58.76 times the estimates of its earnings for the next 12 months, compared with Nvidia's 24.49 and AMD's 20.96.

SMCI Stock Jumps 15%. What's Behind Super Micro's Latest Surge. — Barrons.com,1747234620000,"By Mackenzie TatananniShares of Super Micro Computer extended gains on Wednesday following a flood of good news.The stock surged 15% to $44.57, putting it on pace for its highest close since Feb. 26, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.Super Micro's steep ascent began Tuesday after Raymond James analysts initiated coverage at Outperform with a $41 price target. The firm dubbed the server maker ""a market leader in AI-optimized infrastructure"" and lauded its ability to offer ""competitive pricing"" relative to peers.Also on Tuesday, Super Micro said it had shipped a number of high-density servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices' EPYC 4005 series processors, and separately announced a $20 billion deal with Saudi Arabian data center company DataVolt.The multi-year partnership is meant to accelerate the delivery of GPU platforms and rack systems for DataVolt's hyperscale campuses, the companies said.Shares received an additional boost along with the broader market after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. Super Micro ended Tuesday's session up 16% at $38.89.Regardless of the sharp gains, the stock remains down 53% from its 52-week high and off 62% from its record closing high of $118.81, which it notched in March 2024.Shares peaked at the end of February after the server maker narrowly avoided delisting from the Nasdaq by filing a string of delayed financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Despite the company's proclamation that the matter was ""closed,"" auditor BDO expressed an adverse opinion, stating that Super Micro ""did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.""An adverse opinion indicates that a company's financial statements are misrepresented or inaccurate. While months have passed since the debacle, Raymond James analysts argued that the company's ""reputational risk"" was dampening its valuation.The sudden increase in Super Micro's price, amounting to a 39% gain over the past three days, raises questions as to whether the stock is caught in a short squeeze.A short squeeze occurs when the price of a stock rises unexpectedly instead of falling, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares to diminish their losses. This collective buying can drive up a stock's price even further.As of May 2, 108.28 million shares were sold short, representing 21% of Super Micro's float. As a general rule of thumb, short interest between 10% and 20% is considered high, while any value exceeding 20% is extremely high.Write to Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

US AI execs to give Congress policy wishlist for beating China,1746698400000,"Top executives at American AI giants OpenAI, Microsoft and AMD are set to appear at a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday and outline ways they believe Washington can stay ahead of Beijing in the artificial intelligence race.The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, is looking to cut regulatory barriers to U.S. artificial intelligence after China's DeepSeek shocked the world with a high-quality, affordable AI model last year. The U.S. tech industry has seized on that development to lobby the Trump administration for more favorable policies, arguing that promoting worldwide use of AI that reflects democratic values is a matter of national interest.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, maker of flagship AI model ChatGPT, is expected to testify, as are Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT , and Lisa Su, CEO of AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) NASDAQ:AMD .Altman is expected to testify about societal advances he expects AI to bring about.""This future can be almost unimaginably bright, but only if we take concrete steps to ensure that an American-led version of AI, built on democratic values like freedom and transparency, prevails over an authoritarian one,"" Altman will say, according to prepared remarks seen by Reuters.The development of AI has depended on specialized computer chips, huge amounts of data to train large-language models, vast amounts of energy and a technically skilled workforce. Smith is expected to testify that to succeed, the U.S. will need to support companies at all layers of the AI ecosystem, and partner with allies around the world, according to his prepared remarks.Deepseek, a Hangzhou-based upstart, stunned the world last year when it unveiled a powerful AI model competitive with the likes of OpenAI and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , but cheaper to run.The move was surprising against the backdrop of sweeping rules imposed by President Joe Biden's administration, aimed at cutting off China from American AI chips and capabilities, over fears Beijing could use the powerful technology to supercharge its military. The Trump administration has so far taken a similar approach, last month imposing new licensing requirements on shipments to China of AI chips made by Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and AMD that the companies designed to get around prior export restrictions.But the limitations have spurred criticism from industry participants and some lawmakers who say the rules hamstring U.S. companies and hand the lucrative Chinese AI market to companies like Huawei, which has designed a competitive AI chip known as Ascend. ""The way to beat China in the AI race is to outrace them in innovation, not saddle AI developers with European-style regulations,"" Cruz said in a statement announcing the hearing.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RF1FK:0-us-ai-execs-to-give-congress-policy-wishlist-for-beating-china/"

Trump administration to rescind and replace Biden-era global AI chip export curbs,1746648170000,"U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration plans to rescind and modify a Biden-era rule that curbed the export of sophisticated artificial-intelligence chips, a spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday.The regulation was aimed at further restricting AI chip and technology exports, dividing up the world to keep advanced computing power in the United States and among its allies while finding more ways to block China's access.The Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion was issued in January, a week before the end of the administration of former President Joe Biden. It capped a four-year effort by the Biden administration to hobble China's access to advanced chips that could enhance its military capabilities and to maintain U.S. leadership in AI.""The Biden AI rule is overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation,"" the Commerce spokeswoman said. ""We will be replacing it with a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance."" Last week, Reuters reported the Trump administration was working on changes to the rule that would limit global access to AI chips, including possibly doing away with its splitting the world into tiers that help determine how many advanced semiconductors a country can obtain.According to the Commerce spokeswoman, officials ""didn't like the tiered system"" and said the rule was ""unenforceable."" The spokeswoman did not have a timetable for the new rule. She said debate was still under way on the best course of action. The Biden rule was set to take effect on May 15.Shares of Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , an AI chip designer whose sales could rise if the rule were changed to increase exports, ended 3% higher after the news came out on Wednesday, but then dipped 0.7% in after-hours trade. The Biden rule divided the world into three tiers: 17 countries and Taiwan were in the first tier, which could receive unlimited chips. Some 120 other countries were in the second tier, which was subject to caps on the number of chips the countries could receive. In the third tier, countries of concern including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea were blocked from the chips.But Trump administration officials are weighing discarding the tiered approach to access in the rule and replacing it with a global licensing regime with government-to-government agreements, sources told Reuters last week.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RF25H:0-trump-administration-to-rescind-and-replace-biden-era-global-ai-chip-export-curbs/"

Intel Excels in Stringent AI Benchmark: Should You Buy the Stock?,1746636420000,"Intel Corporation INTC recently announced that it has successfully achieved industry-first full NPU (Neural Processing Unit) compliance in the MLPerf Client v0.6 benchmark. MLPerf is an industry-standard benchmarking suite created to assess AI system performance. The newly released MLPerf Client v0.6 Benchmark is a subset of MLPerf designed to evaluate client devices such as laptops and PCs with a strong emphasis on large language model acceleration and NPU performance. It offers a clear assessment of hardware and software capabilities in swiftly handling AI tasks such as content generation and summarization.During the process, Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processors showcased the fastest NPU response time with an impressive token latency of just 1.09 seconds and the highest NPU throughput at 18.55 tokens per second. Intel also demonstrated remarkable GPU performance during the process. Intel Core Ultra processor is the only NPU to achieve complete compliance, accentuating its strong AI compute capabilities.Intel Rides on AI Traction, Portfolio OptimizationIntel has been taking several strategic decisions to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector, spanning cloud and enterprise servers to networks, volume clients, and ubiquitous edge environments, in line with the evolving market dynamics. Intel’s Xeon 6 processors with Performance-cores have garnered significant industry attention owing to their high-performance AI processing. Intel XEON platforms offer extensive performance improvements coupled with energy efficiency and easy-to-deploy software. With these features, Intel XEON has set a new benchmark in 5G cloud native core, which is driving demand from software vendors and independent telecom manufacturers. The company is witnessing solid market traction in the AI PC market. Backed by strong demand for its core Ultra Chips, Intel remains firmly on track to power more than 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025.Intel is also venturing into the automotive market to capitalize on the growing AI proliferation in that industry. The company’s second-generation AI-powered software-defined vehicle system-on-chip with multi-process node chiplet architecture brings advanced capabilities. The chip offers 10x performance enhancement for generative and multimodal AI, 3x graphics performance, and enhances camera and image processing features. Such state-of-the-art features will boost Intel’s new AI chip demand in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.Intel is divesting 51% of its Altera business to Silver Lake, a prominent global technology investment firm. The move highlights Intel’s strategy to reshape its portfolio, optimize cost structure, strengthen its liquidity position, and boost focus on core operations.One-Year INTC Stock Price PerformanceIntel has plunged 33.3% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 18.7%. The company has underperformed its peer NVIDIA Corporation NVDA but outperformed Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.INTC Plagued by Margin WoesDespite investing heavily in new chip design and manufacturing, Intel is playing a catch-up game with NVIDIA and AMD. In the CPU space, AMD has gained a strong foothold with its Ryzen and EPYC processors. AMD’s strategy of offering competitive pricing with high performance has challenged Intel’s dominance in the CPU market.In the graphics and AI acceleration space, NVIDIA has made significant inroads. It is witnessing strong demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell architectures. Backed by strong industry expertise, both NVIDIA and AMD are aiming to expand their influence in the automotive segment. Intensifying competition with NVIDIA and AMD across multiple end markets is weighing on Intel’s margin.Intel’s debt-to-capital ratio stands at 32% compared to the industry average of 17.3%. As of March 31, 2025, Intel had cash and cash equivalents of $8.95 billion with $44.91 billion of long-term debt. A high debt level may limit sufficient cash flow generation, which is required to meet future debt obligations. Additionally, Intel has a significant presence in China. Growing Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can impact its operations.Estimate Revision Trend of INTCEarnings estimates for Intel for 2025 have moved down 37.5% to 30 cents over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has declined 28.32% to 81 cents. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock.End NoteIntel’s strong AI focus and the expansion of its portfolio offerings for AI PCs, data centers, and automotive markets are commendable. Its effort to lower costs and improve liquidity with strategic divestiture is a positive. However, intensifying competition in the commercial PC, server, storage and networking markets remains a major headwind. In addition, its high dependence on China, imposition of trade tariffs, and Beijing’s move to replace U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives are impeding Intel’s commercial prospects.Its high debt levels make it vulnerable to economic downturns and growing geopolitical unrest. Declining earnings estimate revisions underscore dwindling investors' confidence. Despite heavy investment in chipset innovation and AI acceleration, Intel’s ability to regain a competitive edge appears to be a challenging endeavor. Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

"AMD Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Up Y/Y, Shares Rise",1746634740000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD reported first-quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.23%. The figure surged 54.8% year over year. Revenues of $7.438 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.45% and increased 35.9% year over year, but declined 2.9% sequentially. The top-line growth benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that were partially offset by sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments.AMD shares have risen 1.80% in pre-market trading, driven by strong growth in the key segments. In the year-to-date period, AMD shares have plunged 18.4%.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD Q1 Top Line Rides on Data Center GrowthData Center revenues surged 57.2% year over year to $3.674 billion, accounting for 49.4% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues decreased 4.8% year over year.AMD’s top line benefited from strong Instinct GPU shipments and robust EPYC CPU sales.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. OCI Compute E6 shapes offered cost-to-performance gains, while Google Cloud launched C4D and H4D virtual machines for enhanced performance, scalability, and efficiency in general-purpose and HPC workloads.Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.In the first quarter of 2025, AMD expanded its partnerships with Meta Platforms META Dell Technologies DELL, Jio Platforms, Cisco Systems CSCO, Nokia and others to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure.AMD enhances support for frontier AI models on Instinct GPUs with ROCm software, offering day-zero support for the latest Meta AI Llama 4 and Google Gemma 3 models. Dell Technologies also announced the expansion of its AI for Telecom offering, powered by AMD.AMD, Jio Platforms Limited, Cisco, and Nokia have partnered to form a new Open Telecom AI Platform, aiming to deliver AI-driven solutions that enhance efficiency, security, and capabilities.AMD’s Client Revenues Ride on Ryzen and Mobile ProcessorsThe Client segment’s revenues soared 67.7% year over year to $2.294 billion, accounting for 30.8% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues decreased 0.8% year over year.AMD’s latest Ryzen CPUs, particularly those based on the Zen 5 architecture, have seen strong demand, especially for gaming and high-performance desktops and laptops. The launch of new products, like the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D, helped set sellout records and boosted the client segment.The sales of higher-end products, including Ryzen processors for both desktop and mobile, led to higher average selling prices and contributed positively to revenues.AMD Suffers From Weak Gaming & Embedded RevenuesThe Gaming segment’s revenues declined 29.8% year over year to $647 million, accounting for 8.7% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 14.9% year over year. The decline in year-over-year was primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenues.The Embedded segment revenues were $823 million, down 2.7% year over year and 10.8% sequentially. The segment accounted for 11.1% of total revenues.The decline can be attributed to a gradual recovery in demand across various markets, including test and measurement, communications, and aerospace. Additionally, inventory levels among customers in certain areas, such as the industrial sector, remained elevated, which contributed to the slower recovery.AMD’s Margins Expand Y/Y in Q1Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 53.7%, driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments’ revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 28.1% year over year to $2.213 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 320 bps on a year-over-year basis to 23.9% in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and gross margin.AMD’s Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Remains StrongAs of March 29, 2025, AMD had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.310 billion compared with $5.132 billion as of Dec. 28, 2024.As of March 29, 2025, total debt was $4.16 billion compared with $1.72 billion as of Dec. 28, 2024.Operating cash flow was reported at $939 million compared with $1.299 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.Free cash flow was $727 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with $1.091 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the first quarter, free cash flow margin was 10%.In the first quarter of 2025, AMD returned $749 million to shareholders through a share repurchase program. The company has $4 billion remaining under its current authorization.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveAMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%.For the second quarter, AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 43%.

AMD is a ‘stable second source for GPUs’: is that enough for AMD stock to rally?,1746632984000,"A deeper dive into the earnings release that Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD posted last night suggests the semiconductor stock may be worth owning at current levels, according to a BofA analyst.AMD earned 96 cents on a per-share basis on $7.44 billion in revenue in its fiscal Q1, with both numbers coming in handily above Street estimates.That made Vivek Arya, a senior Bank of America analyst, raise his rating on AMD stock to “buy” on Wednesday. Shares of the multinational chipmaker are currently down well over 20% versus their year-to-date high.AMD is strongly positioned to sustain demandIn his research note, Arya agreed that Advanced Micro Devices is significantly behind Nvidia in the data centre accelerators.However, the demand for its products will likely retain momentum as AMD has built a name for itself as a “stable second source alternative in GPUs.”Over time, as the company based out of Santa Clara, CA continues to improve its technology and AI products, it may steal market share from rivals, potentially leading to a stock price rally.Additionally, the Bank of America analyst sees “continued share gains against the incumbent” on the CPU front as well. Note that AMD stock does not currently pay a dividend.AMD stock has a huge total addressable marketAccording to AMD chief executive Lisa Su, new restrictions on the export of sophisticated chips to China under the Trump administration could result in a $1.5 billion hit in 2025.But that isn’t specific to Advanced Micro Devices. Its larger peer, Nvidia, has warned of billions of dollars worth of hits due to export controls in Q1 as well.Therefore, BofA’s Arya raised his price target on AMD shares this morning to $120, which translates to more than 20% upside from current levels.The Bank of America analyst remains bullish on the Nasdaq-listed firm also because it has a “multi-hundred billion addressable market opportunity in PC, server, high-end gaming, deep learning,” whereas its penetration currently sits at less than 30%, indicating massive room for growth.Wall Street agrees with BofA on Advanced Micro DevicesAdvanced Micro Devices now sees its sales coming in at $7.4 billion in its current financial quarter on a gross margin of about 43%. In comparison, analysts had called for $7.25 billion in revenue only.“While we face some headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including export controls, they’re more than offset by the powerful tailwinds from our leadership product portfolio,” Su told investors on the earnings call last night.Investors should note that BofA isn’t alone in keeping bullish on AMD stock. The consensus rating on the chipmaker also currently sits at “overweight” with the mean target of $131, indicating potential upside of about 30% from here.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:bdd244c4d094b:0-amd-is-a-stable-second-source-for-gpus-is-that-enough-for-amd-stock-to-rally/

Qualcomm to make data center processors that connect to Nvidia chips,1747634400000,"Qualcomm on Monday said it will make custom data center central processing units, or CPUs, that use technology from Nvidia to connect to Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.Nvidia's chips are dominant in the AI market but always paired with CPUs, a market traditionally dominated by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Nvidia has jumped into the CPU market itself, designing a chip using technology from Arm Holdings to develop its own ""Grace"" CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said it would return to the data center CPU market. In the 2010s, Qualcomm began developing an Arm-based CPU that it tested with Meta Platforms, but curtailed those efforts amid cost cuts and legal challenges.But after acquiring a team of ex-Apple chip designers in 2021, Qualcomm has quietly revived those efforts, again holding discussions with Meta about a data center CPU. Qualcomm last week confirmed that it has a letter of understanding with Saudi Arabian AI firm Humain to develop a custom data center CPU.On Monday, Qualcomm said that its future chips would use technology from Nvidia that will help them communicate quickly with Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs), which are the mainstay of its AI chip portfolio.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack-scale architecture, we're advancing a shared vision of high-performance energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Cristiano Amon said on Monday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RP001:0-qualcomm-to-make-data-center-processors-that-connect-to-nvidia-chips/"
AMD Jumps On $10 Billion Saudi AI Partnership,1747210307000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD just scored a huge win with a $10 billion, multi-year deal to power Saudi Arabia's new HUMAIN AI hub with 500 megawatts of its chips and accelerators. Investors cheered, sending AMD shares up nearly 4% as they realized how much revenue could flow from building out that kind of GPU-heavy infrastructure.Lisa Su says the partnership advances global AI infrastructure by marrying AMD's open-architecture gear with HUMAIN's local ecosystem, while HUMAIN's CEO Tareq Amin calls it democratizing AI at the compute levelbasically putting next-gen performance in more hands. And this follows HUMAIN's own $5 billion AWS tie-up from earlier on Tuesday, showing Saudi Arabia's serious push to localize cloud and AI services.Why it matters: That $10 billion commitment bulks up AMD's data-center backlog and highlights how tech geopolitics are reshaping growth opportunities.Keep an eye on AMD's next earnings callinvestors will want to know how soon this deal starts padding the top line and what it means for profit margins as all that horsepower goes live.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:180962354094b:0-amd-jumps-on-10-billion-saudi-ai-partnership/
Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

$10 Billion AI Shockwave: Saudi Arabia Taps AMD to Build a Global Tech Empire,1747204951000,"Saudi Arabia is going all-in on AIand it just roped in a major U.S. chipmaker to help lead the charge. The Kingdom's new AI investment vehicle, Humain, has announced a $10 billion commitment to build a global AI backbone, including hyperscale data centers, clean energy infrastructure, and fiber-optic connectivity from Riyadh to the U.S. AMD NASDAQ:AMD will be supplying chips and software for the rollout. While it's not yet confirmed whether AMD is putting capital into the deal or acting strictly as a vendor, the move could signal a broader pivot: courting sovereign-backed AI projects as an alternative to chasing the usual Big Tech crowd.AMD's CEO Lisa Su called the partnership a significant milestone, hinting at a globally scaled AI architecture that could rival existing setups in openness and reach. With Nvidia also set to contribute chips, Humain appears to be spreading its bets across the AI hardware spectrum. The announcement was made at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh, with former President Donald Trump presenta setting that speaks volumes about the geopolitical stakes behind the deal. For AMD, this could be a shot at gaining market share in a space where Nvidia has long ruled the accelerator roost.Meanwhile, sources suggest the U.S. government is finalizing a deal to give Saudi Arabia broader access to advanced semiconductors, even as it keeps China on a tighter leash. That could pave the way for more sovereign AI projects out of the Gulf, with U.S. chipmakersespecially those outside the Big Tech orbitwell-positioned to benefit. For investors, this isn't just a data center buildout. It's a potential rebalancing of global AI powerand a fresh demand engine for the semiconductor names fueling it.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:58a99b6c0094b:0-10-billion-ai-shockwave-saudi-arabia-taps-amd-to-build-a-global-tech-empire/

"AMD Rises 31% in One Month: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock?",1747405800000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have soared 31.4% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s increase of 19.4% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s growth of 22.5%.The outperformance can be attributed to AMD’s expanding portfolio, accretive acquisitions and rich partner base. The strong adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises have also been major growth drivers for its success.So, how should you play the AMD stock now? Let’s dig deep to find out.AMD's One Month PerformanceAMD’s Expanding Portfolio Aids ProspectAMD’s expanding EPYC portfolio has been noteworthy. In April 2025, AMD announced that Alphabet's GOOGL cloud computing platform, Google Cloud, has introduced new C4D and H4D virtual machines powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors. Alphabet’s Google Cloud’s C4D instances deliver up to 80% higher throughput per vCPU, while Google Cloud’s H4D VMs offer scalable performance for HPC workloads with Cloud RDMA. These advancements underscore Google Cloud’s commitment to leveraging AMD’s Zen 5 architecture for enhanced cloud computing capabilities.AMD’s expanding portfolio in the embedded market has been a key catalyst for growth. In the first quarter of 2025, AMD introduced the EPYC Embedded 9005 Series processors, offering server-grade performance and energy efficiency, along with purpose-built features tailored for the networking, storage, and industrial edge markets.Rich Partner Base & Acquisitions to Boost AMD’s ProspectsA rich partner base that includes Alphabet, Oracle ORCL, Meta Platforms, Dell Technologies, Cisco Systems, Jio Platforms, Nokia and IBM has been playing a key part in expanding AMD’s footprint.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud, expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. AMD announced that its 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors now power Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute E6 Standard shapes. Oracle utilizes these processors to deliver up to 2X the performance of the previous generation at the same cost.AMD expanded its partnership with Dell Technologies to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure. In the reported quarter, AMD announced its collaboration with Dell Technologies to deliver AI-ready solutions for the telecom industry, featuring the Instinct MI300X accelerator to power scalable, high-performance network infrastructures.AMD is also benefiting from accretive acquisitions to strengthen its AI ecosystem and bridge the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the race for AI dominance. Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveDespite an expanding portfolio and a rich partner base, AMD is expected to be hurt by export restrictions on GPUs to China, which will be a headwind and stiff competition from NVIDIA.AMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%. AMD expects approximately $700 million reduction in second-quarter 2025 revenues due to halted MI308X shipments to China.AMD’s Earnings Estimates Trend DownwardThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s second-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, which has decreased 35% over the past 30 days, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.80%.The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $7.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.99%. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.30%.AMD Stock OvervaluedAMD stock is currently overvalued, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.The stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.53X compared with the industry’s 3.31X.Price/Sales (F12M)Conclusion: Hold AMD Stock for NowAMD’s expanding portfolio, strategic acquisitions and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth. However, its near-term prospects are dull due to macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA in the cloud data center and AI chip markets. The growing demand for custom AI chips, offered by companies like Broadcom, is increasing concerns over market share. Stretched valuation also remains a concern. AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million.NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China.Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years.Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA?Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products.Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips.While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price.This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock.However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Wistron says new US plants will be ready for Nvidia's server production next year,1747379233000,"Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Wistron TWSE:3231 said on Friday that its new U.S. manufacturing facilities for its customer Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA would be ready next year and the firm was in talks with potential other customers.Part of the facilities will be used by Nvidia to support its plan to build artificial intelligence servers worth up to $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years.The U.S. firm said in April it planned to build supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, partnering with Foxconn TWSE:2317 in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Both sites are expected to increase production within 12 to 15 months.""I believe it’s exactly in line with what the customer announced. All our progress will follow the customer’s lead,” Wistron CEO Jeff Lin said in his first public comments since Nvidia's announcement.He said the company was in discussion with other customers to use the U.S. facilities, which will produce high-performance computing and AI-related products, declining to disclose their names.Wistron’s board approved a total investment of $500 million in its new U.S. subsidiary to support business development and strategic growth in the U.S.Commenting on U.S. restrictions on exports of advanced chips to China, Lin said demand outside of China remained very strong.""We expect to grow alongside our customers ... As for developments in the Middle East, most of them are essentially our indirect customers.""The United Arab Emirates and the U.S. signed an agreement this week for the Gulf country to build the largest AI campus outside the U.S., in a deal that according to sources could involve purchase of 500,000 of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips per year starting in 2025. As the U.S. threatens sweeping tariffs on many of its trading partners, Wistron said it would also consider producing notebooks in Mexico, noting that such products would not face tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0A9:0-wistron-says-new-us-plants-will-be-ready-for-nvidia-s-server-production-next-year/"

"Markets Mostly Up on Mid-East Wheeling, Dealing",1747346880000,"Thursday, May 15, 2025Markets closed mostly up this session on moderately good news rippling through economic concerns throughout the day. With President Trump continuing his tour through the Middle East, we’re seeing a plethora of deals being made there with American corporations:Boeing BA will send more than 200 jets to Qatar Airways, $142 billion in military equipment investments will go to Saudi Arabia, billions more in Saudi infrastructure with supplies from AMD AMD, Cisco CSCO and others, and 18K AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA will be sent to a company chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.The Dow gained +271 points today, +0.65%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.52%. The Nasdaq, which has risen +13% over the past month, faltered this afternoon following news reports of an SEC investigation into Coinbase COIN and a cybersecurity hack, sending the stock down -7% today. Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks. But we we see Import and Export Prices ahead of the open, as well as Housing Starts and Building Permits — all for April. Earlier today, we saw a sagging Homebuilders Confidence survey for May, as high mortgage and home prices are remaining out of range for many prospective buyers, with many others feeling prices may be due to come down over the coming months.

The company’s first-quarter results benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that fully offset sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Data centers benefited from solid adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises.New product launches, such as the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D and Radeon 9070 series, also bolstered results. Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD’s expanding partner base including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro has been a key catalyst. It has also expanded its portfolio through acquisitions.However, AMD has been suffering from stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA. Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge.(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>> )Union Pacific’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the past year (-6.1% vs. -4.8%). The company is suffering as e-commerce sales have normalized and consumer markets have softened. Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment. Reduced fuel surcharge revenues, too, are a concern.Due to these headwinds, volumes are suffering. Operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) remains under pressure, mainly due to revenue woes. Given the soft freight market scenario, the revenue weakness is likely to persist. To combat the revenue weakness, UNP is looking to cut costs. In the meantime, UNP continues paying dividends.UNP is also active on the buyback front. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point. Our thesis is supported by the Neutral recommendation on the stock.(You can read the full research report on Union Pacific here >>> )Shares of Lowe's have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past year (-1.6% vs. +4.6%).

Nevertheless, Lowe's has implemented a comprehensive Pro-focused strategy, emphasizing improved product availability, timely delivery, and an expanded assortment, complemented by a rewards program.Strategic growth initiatives such as store expansion and enhanced customer experiences aim to position the company as a top omnichannel retailer.

AMD's $6B Buyback And $10B AI Deal: A $16B Gambit to Catch Nvidia,1747338227000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD is making moves. Recently, the chipmaker announced a fresh $6 billion stock buyback, pushing its total repurchase firepower to $10 billion. The goal? Shrink share count, boost EPS, and restore investor confidence. AMD's latest $10 billion AI collaboration with Humain is a bold swing, but questions linger on how quickly that bet can pay off.CEO Lisa Su says the repurchase signals strong belief in AMD's strategic direction and long-term cash flow. But Q1 free cash flow was down over 33%to $727 millionand cash on hand now trails current liabilities. That doesn't leave a huge margin for error. Add to that fierce competition from Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA AI dominance and a wave of custom chipmakers, and AMD's runway feels tight. Still, reducing the share count could help shore up EPSespecially if future earnings stabilize or rebound.The bigger picture? The long-term chart shows AMD's EPS without non-recurring items steadily trending up. Despite stock price swings, earnings performance has been resilient.If buybacks kick in and AI execution improves, the stock could catch up to the fundamentals.

"Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy? ",1747335600000,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze. Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIA Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corporation BAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA? Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corporation MSFT is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corporation ORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"US tech firms Nvidia, AMD secure AI deals as Trump tours Gulf states",1747146903000,"A number of U.S. technology firms on Tuesday announced artificial intelligence deals in the Middle East as U.S. President Donald Trump secured $600 billion in commitments from Saudi Arabia to U.S. companies during a tour of Gulf states.Among the biggest deals, Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a deal with Humain, saying it has formed a $10 billion collaboration. Another company to announce a deal with Humain, was Qualcomm Inc NASDAQ:QCOM , which said it signed a memo of understanding to develop and build a data centre central processor (CPU). The San Diego-based chip designer bought server CPU maker Nuvia in 2021 but has not yet released a product. Trump began his Gulf tour on Tuesday, kicking it off with the signing of a strategic economic agreement with Saudi Arabia as the oil power rolled out the red carpet. Trump's Middle East visit aims to drum up trillions of dollars in investments.The deals will flow both ways. The White House said Saudi Arabian firm DataVolt will invest $20 billion in AI data centres and energy infrastructure in the United States. Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google, DataVolt, Oracle Corp NYSE:ORCL , Salesforce Inc NYSE:CRM , Advanced Micro Devices and Uber NYSE:UBER will invest $80 billion in cutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries, the White House said, without giving details.Trump plans to visit the UAE on Thursday. The New York Times on Monday reported that the Trump administration is nearing a deal to allow UAE to buy large volumes of Nvidia's AI chips.Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and a leading centre for AI activity outside the United States.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday launched Humain to develop and manage AI technologies in Saudi Arabia.AI CHIP DEALSNvidia and Humain said they will leverage Nvidia's platforms to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in AI, GPU cloud computing and digital transformation.In a joint statement, the two companies said they will build AI factories with up to 500 megawatts of capacity that will include ""several hundred thousand"" of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs over five years.In Humain's deal with AMD, the agreement includes a plan to invest up to $10 billion to deploy 500 megawatts of AI hardware infrastructure over five years. The Humain-AMD deal, in addition to hardware purchases, involves a collaboration that aims to help Humain implement a next-generation AI cloud computing platform, according to Keith Strier, AMD senior vice president of global AI markets. ""Together, we are building a globally significant AI platform that delivers performance, openness and reach at unprecedented levels,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su said in a statement.With some capacity set to come online in 2026, Humain will oversee the delivery of the data-crunching power to potential customers, while AMD will provide CPUs, GPUs and its software that helps orchestrate the data crunching. Part of the rationale for closing a deal with AMD is to ensure Humain isn't locked into using a single vendor for AI-related hardware, Strier said. ""And now, in addition to building infrastructure, countries recognize they need to do it in a very resilient way, in these diverse ways,"" Strier said. Chaired by bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, Humain will operate under the Public Investment Fund and will offer AI services and products, including data centres, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models.""In building an AI company, you need the foundation and the infrastructure,"" Humain CEO Tareq Amin said on stage from Riyadh on Tuesday. ""It's a really, really big initiative for the kingdom.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL0P5:0-us-tech-firms-nvidia-amd-secure-ai-deals-as-trump-tours-gulf-states/"
