Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/
Buy the Spike in Intuit (INTU) Stock After Earnings?,1748044980000,"Spiking +8% today, Intuit INTU stock made headlines after comfortably exceeding expectations for its fiscal third quarter after-market hours on Thursday.Sitting on gains of +15% year to date, Intuit stock has outperformed the broader market and many of its notable Zacks Computer-Software peers, including Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM.Not too far from its 52-week high of $734 a share, investors are surely wondering if there is more upside in store for the financial software giant’s stock, with generative AI starting to enhance Intuit’s accounting and tax preparation services. Intuit’s Q3 Results Thanks to its AI-driven solutions, Intuit’s Q3 sales of $7.75 billion eclipsed estimates of $7.54 billion and spiked from $6.73 billion a year ago. CEO Sasan Goodarzi stated Intuit is becoming a one-stop shop for AI agents and AI-enabled human experts. Notably, Intuit Assist offers a generative AI-powered financial assistant that helps users with tax filing, business insights, and financial decision-making. On the bottom line, Intuit's Q3 EPS of $11.65 rose 18% from $9.88 in the comparative quarter and topped expectations of $10.89 per share by nearly 7%. More intriguing, Intuit has now surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 13 consecutive quarters with an average earnings surprise of 12.15% in its last four quarterly reports. Intuit's Revenue Guidance Serving as a further catalyst to Friday’s rally was that Intuit raised its full-year revenue guidance and now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be between $18.72 billion-18.76 billion, up from previous estimates of $18.16 billion-$18.35 billion. This came in above Zacks' estimates of $18.28 billion or 12% growth (Current Year below). Zacks' projections currently call for Intuit’s total sales to increase another 12% in FY26 to $20.48 billion.Monitoring Intuit’s P/E Valuation Following its post-earnings rally, Intuit stock is trading at a 34.5X forward earnings multiple, which is on par with Microsoft but a premium to its industry average of 27.3X, with Salesforce at 25.5X. However, INTU does trade well below its decade-long high of 87.2X forward earnings and offers a 23% discount to its median of 44.9X during this period. Bottom LineFor now, Intuit stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q3 report. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way as earnings estimate revisions could trend higher in the coming weeks, considering Intuit’s elevated revenue guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2309070b7094b:0-buy-the-spike-in-intuit-intu-stock-after-earnings/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Microsoft Is Rolling Out AI Agents. Developers Are Finding Coding Errors. — Barrons.com,1748032800000,"By Adam LevineThis past week saw two tech titans fighting for attention with dueling developer conferences: Microsoft Build and Google I/O. Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI ""agents."" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, ""fix the build error on apple platforms,"" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. ""How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?"" one developer asked on GitHub.""We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,"" another developer on GitHub said. ""Is the ROI even worth it?""The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: ""We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.""As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.""By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,"" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. ""We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.""Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia (NVDA) Hits Reset as Cloud Spending Slows,1748023282000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) is switching gears. With cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and Google tightening the purse strings, Nvidias no longer betting only on mega AI builds.CEO Jensen Huang just rolled out NVLink Fusiontech that lets outside chips link up with Nvidias platform. Its a smart hedge: stay relevant, even when the big checks slow down.Hes also targeting regular businesses now, not just tech titans. Think: new servers built for the rest of us.Meanwhile, Chinas getting tougher. U.S. export limits mean Nvidia is selling weaker chips thereand losing ground.Sure, Nvidia has closed some giant AI deals in the Gulf. But analysts say those are exceptions, not the norm.Behind the scenes, Taiwans still doing the heavy lifting. Solomon Technology stock popped 241% after Huang gave it a shoutout. Thats how tight the partnership runs.Huangs not sweating the slowdown. He says AI demand is still strongthis is just a breather.Still, selling to businesses takes time.

U.S. Treasuries Might Be Wildly Undervalued. Here's an Example. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"By Martin BaccardaxImagine an innovation-driven global powerhouse, with interests and influence in virtually every country in the world, that ratings companies trust as a fail-safe bet to use investors' borrowed cash wisely and return it timely.Just a few months ago, you could have reliably used that description to characterize the U.S. government and its Treasury bonds. Today, investors are essentially saying the same thing about Microsoft. But that doesn't mean investors should trade in their Treasuries for the Windows and AI-backed paper just yet.Yields on the short-term bonds issued by the world's most valuable company — an AAA-rated tech giant that generates more than $60 billion in year in free cash flow — are trading lower than the yields on equivalent U.S. Treasury notes — from an Aa1-rated government that takes in $4.9 trillion in taxes each year. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields, and lower yields often signify that investors see less risk in holding those securities.For debt with longer maturities, the extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to own Microsoft's 30-year bond — instead of allegedly risk-free 30-year Treasuries — is just 20 basis points. That's the lowest on record, according to data from Bank of America's weekly 'Flow Show' report, and down from more than 100 basis points just two years ago. (One hundred basis points equals one percentage point.)Now, as an investor, there are two possible rationales for this: One, you either think the likelihood of Microsoft paying its coupon on time over the next three decades, and making you whole at the end, is roughly the same as the U.S. government, or, two, you think U.S. Treasuries are wildly undervalued.Signals from BofA's 'Flow Show' report suggest it might be the latter.The 10-year rolling return for a basket of longer-dated Treasuries, based on current pricing, turned negative for the first time in decades this year, according to BofA figures. The return of around -1.3%, in fact, matched the ""humiliating place stock returns were"" during the market's trough in February 2009, during the global financial crisis, the bank said.Sharp-eyed readers will note, of course, that stocks bottomed out the following month and embarked on the longest bull run in financial market history, with the S&P 500 delivering annualized returns of 17.8% for each of the next 10 years.U.S. Treasuries might not be ready for that kind of roaring gain. But after Moody's stripped the government of its coveted AAA-status last week and 30-year bond yields topped 5.15% earlier this week, the highest since 2007, investors are starting to see value.Around $25 billion in new money found its way into bond portfolios in the latest week, BofA's flow report indicated, outpacing the $16 billion moved into cash. Stock funds, meanwhile, suffered their first outflows in two months, losing $4.1 billion even as the S&P 500 rallied to within 3% of its all time high.Oscar Wilde once noted that a cynic is the sort of person that knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. As Treasuries sold off this week, there appeared to be plenty of cynics focused on the government bonds' levels and the impact of U.S. fiscal profligacy, discounting the value in the trade as a result.Long-dated yields are moving lower in early Friday trading, and could rally even further next week if minutes from the Federal Reserve's May policy meeting hint another rate cut or a tamer-than-expected reading of the April's personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, inflation gauge.""[There is] nothing more contrarian in 2025 than being long the long-end, "" BofA writes. ""And while the 2020s spending of Biden's Build Back Better + taxation of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill don't a AAA-rating make, we say return of bond vigilantes to (the 5% level on 30-year Treasury yields) is a cyclical buy opportunity.""Write to editors@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The new target suggests about a 13% upside from current levels.The upgrade followed Evercore's recent Microsoft 360 event, where company leaders and partners discussed strategic priorities.Materne said Microsoft is all in on AI, pointing to strong enterprise demand and its dual engines: Copilot productivity tools and Azure cloud services. He noted that only around 20% of IT workloads are in the cloud today, a figure that could rise toward 80%.He highlighted GitHub Copilot and Copilot for Teams as key adoption drivers, and said free access to Copilot Chat may accelerate user growth.Materne slightly lifted his fiscal year 2026 estimates, citing robust Azure demand beyond AI.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Salesforce and Microsoft,1747996020000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Salesforce CRM and Microsoft MSFT.Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down -2% Ahead of Earnings?Salesforce stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM's slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28.The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service.CRM's growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce's offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce's transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM's Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce's new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program ""agents"" for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development.Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said ""nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,"" and all of its ""top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.""The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, ""achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation."" The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce's AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company's EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT's 1,700% and Tech's 720%.Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector's 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft's 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech's 115% and Microsoft's 150%.CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech's 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM's PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Ferguson is beginning to shut down some efforts started by his predecessor Lina Khan, including dropping a case on Thursday that had accused PepsiCo NASDAQ:PEP of price discrimination that favored Walmart NYSE:WMT .The FTC lost an appeal on May 7 seeking to reverse a judge's decision declining to block the Microsoft-Activision deal, which closed in 2023.Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Thursday that the FTC's decision to drop the case was ""a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C.""When challenging a new merger, the FTC typically asks a judge to temporarily block the deal to give the agency time to challenge it in its own administrative court.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI Enters Hardware Era In $6.5 Billion Deal,1747945516000,"OpenAI is venturing into hardware with its $6.5 billion acquisition of Sir Jony Ive's io, aiming to launch AI-powered companions by 202627 that blend unobtrusive design with real-world awareness.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities calls physical AI the next critical trend and sees the Ive partnership as a strategic play to marry leading AI models with Apple NASDAQ:AAPL -grade industrial design. Prototypes, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, pack cameras and microphones for environmental detection in a screen-less form factor roughly the size of an iPod Shufflewearable around the neck and leveraging connected PCs or smartphones for displays. Kuo's industry checks point to mass production in 2027, with assembly outside China to minimize geopolitical risk.The deal injects design heft into Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT - and SoftBank-backed OpenAI, which paid $5 billion in stock and expanded its existing 23% io stake valued at $1.5 billion. Altman and Ive emphasize stealth to prevent rivals from cloning their concept and reference Alan Kay's dictum that serious software players must craft their own hardware. This pivot follows Google's NASDAQ:GOOG I/O AI showcase and underscores OpenAI's bid to shift the narrative back in its favor.Why It Matters Investors should note that integrating cutting-edge AI with premium hardware could unlock higher margins and create stickier consumer offerings, elevating OpenAI's competitive moat against Big Tech's software-only strategy.Investors will look for prototype demos at year-end events and monitor official launch timing as the company refines specs ahead of a late-2026 debut.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:539777670094b:0-microsoft-backed-openai-enters-hardware-era-in-6-5-billion-deal/

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Market Chatter: Microsoft-backed Builder.ai's Former Executives Said to Have Reported 'Bogus' Sales,1747935934000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed Builder.ai collapsed followed an internal inquiry, which found that the company's former executives allegedly reported ""bogus"" sales to the board, The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing people close to the matter. The provisional accounts submitted by the technology startup to its auditor showed that the company revised its 2024 revenue estimates to about $55 million from a previously reported estimate of $220 million. It also reduced its previously reported 2023 total sales revenue of $180 million to about $45 million, the report said, citing the people. The prior revenue figures were submitted to the board when founder Sachin Dev Duggal was CEO, the report said. Duggal resigned as CEO along with Builder.ai's Chief Revenue Officer Varghese Cherian in early 2025, according to the report. The people familiar with the matter said that sales, which were previously booked, remained outstanding for an extended period of time due to Duggal's departure, raising concerns regarding revenue recognition. This eventually led to hiring of a law firm by the board to investigate the matter. The law firm shared its findings, which showed that there may have been a coordinated effort to inflate revenue at the company, the report said. Builder.ai said Tuesday it would enter insolvency proceedings and appoint an administrator to oversee the company's affairs.

Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

Microsoft Sues To Curb Lumma Stealer Threat,1747924465000,"On Wednesday, Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Digital Crimes Unit brought suit on May 13 against Lumma Stealer, an information-stealing malware used by hundreds of threat actors to siphon passwords, credit-card data, bank details and cryptocurrency wallets.Between March 16 and May 16, Microsoft detected over 394,000 Windows PCs infected with Luma Stealer, according to assistant general counsel Steven Masada in a company blog post. Leveraging a U.S. court order, the DCU seized or took down roughly 2,300 malicious domains forming Lumma's command-and-control backbone. Simultaneously, the Department of Justice disrupted the malware's central servers and online marketplaces, while Europol's EC3 and Japan's JC3 suspended locally based infrastructure nodesmarking one of the most extensive multinational takedowns of an info-stealer to date.The growth and resilience of Lumma Stealer highlights the broader evolution of cybercrime and underscores the need for layered defenses and industry collaboration to counter threats, Microsoft said in a separate post. Analysts note this legal offensive follows earlier DCU actions against other high-profile info-stealers and could pressure peers such as CrowdStrike NASDAQ:CRWD and Palo Alto Networks NASDAQ:PANW to accelerate feature rollouts. Compared with a similar takedown of TrickBot in October 2024, which involved 1,100 domains and an estimated 150,000 infections, this operation more than doubles the scale of disruption.Why It Matters This aggressive move not only hampers Lumma's infrastructure but also underscores Microsoft's growing role as both defender and regulator, signaling to investors its commitment to bolstering enterprise-security offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e4eb38b37094b:0-microsoft-sues-to-curb-lumma-stealer-threat/

Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down 20% Before Earnings for AI Growth?,1747915200000,"Salesforce ( CRM )  stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM’s slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28. The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service. CRM’s growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce’s offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce’s transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft (MSFT) and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM’s Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce’s new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program “agents” for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development. Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said “nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,” and all of its “top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.”The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, “achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation.” The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce’s AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company’s EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT’s 1,700% and Tech’s 720%. Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector’s 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft’s 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech’s 115% and Microsoft’s 150%. CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech’s 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM’s PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:faad8e6f8094b:0-buy-this-megacap-tech-stock-down-20-before-earnings-for-ai-growth/

The consensus mark for non-GAAP earnings has remained unchanged at $2.54 per share over the past 60 days, which calls for a 4.1% increase from the year-ago quarter’s level.Salesforce’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 4.4%.

With businesses globally undergoing digital overhauls, Salesforce's commitment to aligning its product offerings with customer needs is likely to have boosted its revenues for the quarter.The growing demand for generative AI-enabled cloud solutions has been a major catalyst for Salesforce. By embedding generative AI tools across its products, the company not only enhances customer engagement but also strengthens its competitive position in the customer relationship management space. This forward-thinking approach might have significantly contributed to its top-line growth during the to-be-reported quarter.Salesforce’s ability to deepen relationships with leading brands across industries and expand its reach in key geographic markets remains a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company’s increasing footprint in the public sector is likely to have provided a further boost, unlocking new growth opportunities during the first quarter.The acquisitions of Spiff, Own and Zoomin have been pivotal in enhancing Salesforce's capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. These additions are likely to have driven higher subscription revenues, particularly across its core cloud services. Salesforce’s key cloud offerings, including Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data, are expected to have delivered robust growth.Our first-quarter revenue estimates for Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data cloud services are pegged at $2.14 billion, $2.34 billion, $1.84 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. We expect revenues of approximately $9.21 billion and $518.8 million for the Subscription and Support segment and the Professional Services division, respectively.The ongoing cost restructuring initiative is likely to have boosted Salesforce’s profitability in the first quarter. The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 33.1%, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of cost restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.CRM’s Price Performance & ValuationOver the past year, Salesforce shares have risen 1.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry’s growth of 10.4%. Compared to its peers, CRM stock has also underperformed other enterprise software makers, including SAP SE SAP, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT. Over the past year, shares of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have gained 53.1%, 26.7% and 6%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value Salesforce offers investors at the current levels. CRM stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.48X compared with the industry’s 9.25X.CRM stock also trades at a discounted multiple compared with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/S multiples of 8.38X, 6.77X and 10.87X, respectively.Investment Thesis for Salesforce StockSalesforce is the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management industry, consistently outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Gartner’s annual rankings reaffirm its top position year after year. Its ability to maintain this dominance stems from its expansive product suite, seamless integrations and innovative approach to enterprise solutions.Strategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in strengthening its market position. The $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack in 2021 significantly enhanced its collaboration capabilities, making Salesforce a comprehensive enterprise software provider. More recently, the $1.9-billion acquisition of Own Company in 2024 bolstered its data protection and AI capabilities, a move that aligns with growing enterprise priorities around security and automation.Salesforce’s AI initiatives further cement its leadership. Since introducing Einstein GPT in March 2023, the company has expanded its AI-driven functionalities across its entire ecosystem. This technology enhances automation, streamlines workflows and improves customer interactions, giving Salesforce a significant advantage as AI adoption accelerates across industries.Additionally, Salesforce is positioned to benefit from the continued rise in worldwide IT spending. Gartner projects global IT spending to reach $5.61 trillion in 2025, implying a 9.8% year-over-year increase. Enterprise software spending is expected to grow even faster, rising 14.2% year over year. As digital transformation remains a top priority for businesses, Salesforce is well-positioned to capture a substantial share of these increasing budgets.Conclusion: Hold CRM Stock Ahead of Q1 ResultsThe company’s leadership in customer relationship management, aggressive AI expansion and increasing enterprise IT spending trends create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Its ability to deliver earnings growth despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties makes the stock worth holding.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7c0b962d1094b:0-salesforce-gears-up-to-post-q1-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/
"Stock Market News for May 22, 2025",1747909440000,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday following spike in yields of long-dated U.S. sovereign bonds. Market participants remained concerned that the proposed tax-cut bill of President Trump will further worsen U.S. fiscal deficit. The U.S.-China tariff war also remained unresolved. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 1.9% or 816.80 points to close at 41,860.44. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and one finished in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 18,872.64, sliding 1.4% due to weak performance of technology bigwigs. Technology giants like Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL fell 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The S&P 500 tumbled 1.6% to finish at 5,844.61. All 11 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in negative territory. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) decreased 2%, 2.1%, 2.3% and 2.7%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 15.4% to 20.87. A total of 19.39 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 17.34 billion. The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities. As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February. Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:747eff640094b:0-stock-market-news-for-may-22-2025/

Microsoft Could Rally as EU Antitrust Case Nears Resolution,1747855440000,"It didn’t really need much boosting, but Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT stock got more good news in a week when the market is looking for direction. The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its  market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a “clear and complete resolution” to its rivals’ concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft’s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it’s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it’s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That’s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it’s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it’s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft’s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft’s productivity applications.That’s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a “walled garden” effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company’s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock’s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock’s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average. Also, Microsoft’s estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11.35% is below its three-year average of 15.9%. From a technical standpoint, the move lower on May 21 dropped the stock below its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages, which may be a sign that a reversal is in place.While short-term volatility exists, Microsoft's strong fundamentals and market position suggest a favorable outlook for investors. Analysts continue to bid the stock higher. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give MSFT stock a Moderate Buy rating with a $512.63 price target that marks a 13% upside from its price on May 21.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:59be14231094b:0-microsoft-could-rally-as-eu-antitrust-case-nears-resolution/

Google Has Made Progress in AI. Its Challenge Is Making Products. — Barrons.com,1747848660000,"By Adam LevineThis article is from the free weekly Barron's Tech email newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox.Burying the Lead. At Google I/O, the search giant's annual developers conference, Alphabet-unit Google unveiled its answer to new AI search engines like Perplexity and ChatGPT, which are nipping at its heels. But Google Search's new ""AI Mode"" was buried beneath a blizzard of other announcements, some more important than others.Let's sort through it.Grinding Its Way to AI Relevance. Despite a decade of heavy investment into AI, Google wound up racing from behind when OpenAI's ChatGPT leapfrogged it in November 2022. While we still await some of the most advanced products that were announced at I/O, Google's underlying AI technology seems to be catching up through heavy investment and rapid iteration.Handicapped. AI Mode is an important step in Google's battle to stave off new competition from AI search engines. It pairs the benefits of AI with the power of Google Search's unparalleled web index. But the implementation shows how the search giant is handicapped in this battle.Accessing AI Mode requires an extra click, which will likely reduce usage. In designing the new interface element, Google had to be careful not to break the search experience that users know so well — type and hit return. Perplexity and ChatGPT don't have a legacy interface to serve, and they can make the AI search experience more natural.Making AI Is Hard, but It's Easier Than Making Products. AI announcements at I/O included AI Mode, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini Live, Gemini in Chrome, Veo 3, Imagen 4, Flow, Beam, Canvas, Agent Mode, and that doesn't include experimental products like Project Aura and Project Astra.Without looking it up, can anyone tell me what all these things do, and why I should use them? The product branding feels removed from the use case, potentially leading to customer confusion.This gets back to Google's longtime problem with turning tech into products. As tracked by the website KilledByGoogle.com, Google has shut down 296 products over the years. It has had 13 messaging apps, four of which are still going.Google's challenge is bringing all these strands together in a way that makes a simple pitch to users, the same way Search did in 1997.Making Agents Happen. One loud-and-clear message from both Google I/O and Microsoft's Monday Build conference is that AI ""agents"" are where these companies see the future. Agents are apps that work on top of an AI language model, automating a series of tasks from simple commands. Microsoft is pitching them to its business customers, while Google unveiled Agent Mode for consumer use.For Google, it's vital to maintain control of these AI personal assistants. Once let loose in a browser, these agents can go everywhere a human goes, including searching on Google. The issue is AI agents don't care about Google's advertising. At some point in the not-too-distant future, a large portion of web traffic may be AI agents. All ad-supported services, including Google Search, should find that troubling.But if Google is the one providing the agents, it can monetize them, making up for the loss of human traffic on the web.This Week in Barron's Tech- Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals.

IonQ Stock Jumps 21% Following Q1 Earnings Results: Still a Buy?,1747847700000,"IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company’s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share’s Price Performance Post Q1 Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ’s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ’s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ’s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions — Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq’s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella’s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ’s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts’ optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%. Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ’s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ’s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors. Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ’s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company’s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ’s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption. The recent 21% increase in share price following first-quarter 2025 earnings is more than just momentum; it reflects meaningful strategic progress.The $22-million commercial deal with EPB, expanding government partnerships like DARPA’s benchmarking initiative, and acquisitions that bolster capabilities in quantum internet infrastructure all underscore IonQ’s leadership in a rapidly evolving space.Despite high R&D expenses and integration risks, IonQ’s nearly $700 million cash position provides the financial flexibility to pursue innovation aggressively without compromising its long-term vision. While the stock’s valuation is lofty, the narrowing consensus loss estimates and reaffirmed guidance signal growing confidence in execution.For long-term investors willing to embrace volatility, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a company building the foundation of next-generation computing and secure communications.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:440e7a061094b:0-ionq-stock-jumps-21-following-q1-earnings-results-still-a-buy/

Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday.

Adobe Jumps 19% in a Month: Is There Any Momentum Left in the Stock?,1747843860000,"Adobe ADBE shares have jumped 19% in a month, reflecting its deepening Generative AI (Gen AI) focus and innovative Gen AI-powered portfolio. A pause in tariffs that reduced macroeconomic uncertainty also helped the stock. However, Adobe’s near-term prospects remain challenging given stiff competition in the AI and GenAI space from the likes of Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI, as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions. Adobe’s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Gen AI solutions.Stiff competition has negatively impacted Adobe shares, which have underperformed peers like Microsoft and document services & e-signature provider DocuSign DOCU over the past month, but outperformed Alphabet. Microsoft, DocuSign and Alphabet shares returned 24.9%, 20.9% and 8.2%, respectively, over the same timeframe. The challenging near-term prospect is expected to remain an overhang on the Adobe shares.ADBE Stock’s PerformanceAdobe shares are also overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of D. ADBE stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.28X compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.14X, Salesforce’s 6.61X, DocuSign’s 5.69X and Alphabet’s 5.90X.Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)So, what should investors do with Adobe shares right now? Let’s dig deep to find out.Can Adobe’s Innovative Portfolio Boost Prospects?Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns.

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/

Buy the Spike in Intuit (INTU) Stock After Earnings?,1748044980000,"Spiking +8% today, Intuit INTU stock made headlines after comfortably exceeding expectations for its fiscal third quarter after-market hours on Thursday.Sitting on gains of +15% year to date, Intuit stock has outperformed the broader market and many of its notable Zacks Computer-Software peers, including Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM.Not too far from its 52-week high of $734 a share, investors are surely wondering if there is more upside in store for the financial software giant’s stock, with generative AI starting to enhance Intuit’s accounting and tax preparation services. Intuit’s Q3 Results Thanks to its AI-driven solutions, Intuit’s Q3 sales of $7.75 billion eclipsed estimates of $7.54 billion and spiked from $6.73 billion a year ago. CEO Sasan Goodarzi stated Intuit is becoming a one-stop shop for AI agents and AI-enabled human experts. Notably, Intuit Assist offers a generative AI-powered financial assistant that helps users with tax filing, business insights, and financial decision-making. On the bottom line, Intuit's Q3 EPS of $11.65 rose 18% from $9.88 in the comparative quarter and topped expectations of $10.89 per share by nearly 7%. More intriguing, Intuit has now surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 13 consecutive quarters with an average earnings surprise of 12.15% in its last four quarterly reports. Intuit's Revenue Guidance Serving as a further catalyst to Friday’s rally was that Intuit raised its full-year revenue guidance and now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be between $18.72 billion-18.76 billion, up from previous estimates of $18.16 billion-$18.35 billion. This came in above Zacks' estimates of $18.28 billion or 12% growth (Current Year below). Zacks' projections currently call for Intuit’s total sales to increase another 12% in FY26 to $20.48 billion.Monitoring Intuit’s P/E Valuation Following its post-earnings rally, Intuit stock is trading at a 34.5X forward earnings multiple, which is on par with Microsoft but a premium to its industry average of 27.3X, with Salesforce at 25.5X. However, INTU does trade well below its decade-long high of 87.2X forward earnings and offers a 23% discount to its median of 44.9X during this period. Bottom LineFor now, Intuit stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q3 report. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way as earnings estimate revisions could trend higher in the coming weeks, considering Intuit’s elevated revenue guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2309070b7094b:0-buy-the-spike-in-intuit-intu-stock-after-earnings/
Market Chatter: Crusoe Receives $11.6 Billion in Funding for OpenAI Data Center in Texas,1747825916000,"Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's partner Crusoe has received $11.6 billion in new funding commitments for a data center in Abilene, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The funding, which will come from a mixture of debt and equity provided by Blue Owl Capital (OWL) and Crusoe, will expand the data center to eight buildings from its previously planned two, each equipped with up to 50,000 Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Blackwell chips, the report said. Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle NYSE:ORCL agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI agreed to rent servers from Oracle while Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips, according to the report. OpenAI, Blue Owl, Crusoe, and Oracle did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250521:A3382614:0/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife.

For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card.

Microsoft Is Rolling Out AI Agents. Developers Are Finding Coding Errors. — Barrons.com,1748032800000,"By Adam LevineThis past week saw two tech titans fighting for attention with dueling developer conferences: Microsoft Build and Google I/O. Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI ""agents."" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, ""fix the build error on apple platforms,"" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. ""How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?"" one developer asked on GitHub.""We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,"" another developer on GitHub said. ""Is the ROI even worth it?""The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: ""We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.""As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.""By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,"" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. ""We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.""Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"OpenAI, Google, xAI battle for superstar AI talent, shelling out millions",1747821600000,"The contest in Silicon Valley to dominate artificial intelligence is playing out on a new court: superstar researchers.While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters.“The AI labs approach hiring like a game of chess,” said Ariel Herbert-Voss, CEO of cybersecurity startup RunSybil and a former OpenAI researcher who entered the talent fight after launching his own company. “They want to move as fast as possible, so they are willing to pay a lot for candidates with specialized and complementary expertise, much like the game pieces. They are like, do I have enough rooks? Enough knights?”Companies including OpenAI and Google, eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called “ICs” – the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies.Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI’s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech’s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman’s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources – both people and compute – behind the work he was excited about.“It was actually financially not the best option that I had,” he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers. That hasn’t stopped companies from throwing millions of dollars in bonuses and pay packages at star researchers, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever’s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said.Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said. Google declined to comment.In contrast, top engineers at big tech companies receive an average yearly compensation of $281,000 in salary and $261,000 in equity, according to Comprehensive.io, a company that tracks tech industry compensation.10,000x TALENTWhile talent has always been important in Silicon Valley, the difference with the AI boom is how few people are in this elite group – depending on who you ask, the number could range from a few dozen to around a thousand, eight sources told Reuters.That is based on the belief that this very small number of ‘ICs’ have made outsized contributions to the development of large language models, the technology today’s AI boom is based on, and therefore could make or break the success of an AI model. “sure 10x engineers are cool but damn those 10,000x engineer/researchers…,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted in late 2023, alluding to a long held maxim that the best software engineers were 10 times as good as the average (10x), but now in the AI industry, the best researchers are 10,000 times (10,000x) as effective as the average.The September departure of OpenAI’s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, who then founded a rival AI startup, has intensified the AI talent war. Murati, who was known at OpenAI for her management skills and execution prowess, recruited 20 OpenAI employees before announcing her company in February. She has now lured even more researchers from OpenAI and other labs, and the team is now around 60 people, two sources told Reuters. Though the company has no product in the market, Murati is in the middle of closing record-breaking seed round that is, based on the team’s strength. A representative for Murati declined to comment.The scarcity of talent has forced companies to approach hiring creatively. Zeki Data, a data firm focused on identifying top AI talent, said it is employing sports industry data analysis techniques like the one popularized by the movie ""Moneyball"" to identify promising but undiscovered talent. For instance, Zeki Data discovered Anthropic has been hiring researchers with theoretical physics backgrounds, and other AI companies have hired individuals with quantum computing backgrounds.Anthropic did not reply to a request for comment.“On my team, I have extraordinarily talented mathematicians who wouldn't have come to this field if it weren't for the fast progress that we're seeing now,” said Sébastien Bubeck, who left his role as vice president of GenAI research at Microsoft last year to join OpenAI. “We're seeing an influx of talent from all fields going into AI now. And some of these people are very, very clever, and they make a difference.”","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR0XL:0-openai-google-xai-battle-for-superstar-ai-talent-shelling-out-millions/"

Will AI Empower the PR Industry or Create Endless Seas of Spam? — WSJ,1747821600000,"By Patrick CoffeePublic-relations agencies email reporters every day with suggestions to cover their clients, but this pitch from March stood out from the flood with its unusual subject line: ""You care more about Tesla than a cancer killing thousands.""The email went on to scold U.S.-based reporters for giving priority to Tesla earnings news and celebrity gossip over the work of Mainz Biomed, a German firm that develops tests for colorectal cancer.After rattling off statistics about increasing cancer rates, it stated, ""This isn't a future problem. It's happening right now. But you wouldn't know, because you've been covering crap that doesn't matter. Do better.""This pitch was generated entirely by an artificial intelligence tool called PRAI, which suggested getting reporters' attention by combining the well-known Tesla name with a confrontational tone, according to Valentin Saitarli, who is chief executive of PRAI and managing director of Exclusive PR Solutions, a public relations firm that represents Mainz Biomed.It succeeded in generating attention — and hostility.""This was an extremely efficient pitch and made lots of people angry, very angry,"" Saitarli said. ""We just wanted to showcase the product and invite to interviews, but we were attacked by so much hate."" Mainz Biomed didn't respond to requests for comment.Is this the future of public relations?The email is an extreme example of AI being applied to PR without proper human oversight, according to communications veterans. But the field is already being changed by AI in other ways.Nearly every major PR firm has named an AI leader, and they have also developed a range of proprietary tools.Edelman, the largest global PR firm by revenue, has built a ""generative engine optimization"" tool to improve clients' image among large language models as search results become less about driving clicks than maintaining reputations.When a client is the subject of negative headlines, the PR firm Golin can use AI to track more real-time responses and test potential responses on synthetic focus groups created by large language models, said Jeff Beringer, chief AI officer at the agency, part of Interpublic Group of Cos.The rise of generative AI has also facilitated a new wave of startups that automatically generate news releases and emails or cater to more niche PR functions.PodPitch was specifically designed to help communications professionals land their clients on podcasts, said co-founder Neal Shulman. Its product uses AI to match users' topical keywords with transcriptions from thousands of podcast episodes and generate personalized pitch emails based on clients' qualifications and the shows they are targeting, Shulman said.Big companies are also deploying AI for their own PR, communications and promotional activities.Microsoft last year developed a generative AI interface that summarizes mentions of Microsoft in news stories, podcasts and social-media posts so its communications team can more quickly develop a response strategy, said Steve Clayton, vice president of communications strategy at Microsoft.The company also uses its Copilot AI tool to develop social-media posts, conduct research and prepare executives for public speeches, but never releases any sort of AI-influenced content without thorough human review, according to Clayton.""We're using it more as an input into the process than an output from the process,"" he said.When food delivery service Grubhub conducted research for a 2024 promotion that focused on meals for women who had just given birth, survey respondents rated sushi and shellfish as their biggest cravings.But when Grubhub used AI-powered facial recognition technology to scrutinize participants' expressions, they saw much greater enthusiasm for cold cuts and sandwiches. Grubhub subsequently edited the campaign's main video to include more comfort foods.""You get a much better, more honest read on how they were feeling about that content versus what they say, because, you know, people are liars sometimes,"" said Dave Tovar, Grubhub's senior vice president of communications and government relations.AI has complicated the jobs of PR people as well.The technology made email outreach less effective by encouraging an ever-larger deluge of spam messages, according to Nick Toso, CEO and co-founder of Rolli, a tool that connects reporters with subject matter experts for their stories.It has also increased the prevalence of artificial ""experts"" designed to trick journalists into quoting their commentary and boosting affiliated businesses' search engine rankings, said Toso, who was previously Washington, D.C., bureau chief and senior producer at CNN's Spanish-language division.Rolli uses AI tools and a team of human researchers to validate experts' identities and qualifications through extensive reviews of their articles, social-media posts and résumés, said Toso.""If we're trying to tell people who the reliable sources are, we should also be able to tell them who the unreliable sources are,"" he said.PR shops can similarly vet influencers for clients more quickly by using AI to review years' of content, thereby ensuring that no past posts or comments could derail a brand's campaign.Some communications professionals remain skeptical that AI can encroach upon the discipline as quickly or as thoroughly as it has in the case of advertising.Communications relies more heavily on the nuances of one-on-one engagement between real humans, according to Wendy Zajack, adjunct faculty at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.Automation and AI-generated content risk getting in the way of that, according to Zajack, and bothering journalists to boot.""I do feel like we might see an allergic reaction to some of this in terms of seeking out really interesting, individualistic content and messaging, because we have just been inundated with a lot of crap,"" she said.Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521003374:0/

U.S. Treasuries Might Be Wildly Undervalued. Here's an Example. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"By Martin BaccardaxImagine an innovation-driven global powerhouse, with interests and influence in virtually every country in the world, that ratings companies trust as a fail-safe bet to use investors' borrowed cash wisely and return it timely.Just a few months ago, you could have reliably used that description to characterize the U.S. government and its Treasury bonds. Today, investors are essentially saying the same thing about Microsoft. But that doesn't mean investors should trade in their Treasuries for the Windows and AI-backed paper just yet.Yields on the short-term bonds issued by the world's most valuable company — an AAA-rated tech giant that generates more than $60 billion in year in free cash flow — are trading lower than the yields on equivalent U.S. Treasury notes — from an Aa1-rated government that takes in $4.9 trillion in taxes each year. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields, and lower yields often signify that investors see less risk in holding those securities.For debt with longer maturities, the extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to own Microsoft's 30-year bond — instead of allegedly risk-free 30-year Treasuries — is just 20 basis points. That's the lowest on record, according to data from Bank of America's weekly 'Flow Show' report, and down from more than 100 basis points just two years ago. (One hundred basis points equals one percentage point.)Now, as an investor, there are two possible rationales for this: One, you either think the likelihood of Microsoft paying its coupon on time over the next three decades, and making you whole at the end, is roughly the same as the U.S. government, or, two, you think U.S. Treasuries are wildly undervalued.Signals from BofA's 'Flow Show' report suggest it might be the latter.The 10-year rolling return for a basket of longer-dated Treasuries, based on current pricing, turned negative for the first time in decades this year, according to BofA figures. The return of around -1.3%, in fact, matched the ""humiliating place stock returns were"" during the market's trough in February 2009, during the global financial crisis, the bank said.Sharp-eyed readers will note, of course, that stocks bottomed out the following month and embarked on the longest bull run in financial market history, with the S&P 500 delivering annualized returns of 17.8% for each of the next 10 years.U.S. Treasuries might not be ready for that kind of roaring gain. But after Moody's stripped the government of its coveted AAA-status last week and 30-year bond yields topped 5.15% earlier this week, the highest since 2007, investors are starting to see value.Around $25 billion in new money found its way into bond portfolios in the latest week, BofA's flow report indicated, outpacing the $16 billion moved into cash. Stock funds, meanwhile, suffered their first outflows in two months, losing $4.1 billion even as the S&P 500 rallied to within 3% of its all time high.Oscar Wilde once noted that a cynic is the sort of person that knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. As Treasuries sold off this week, there appeared to be plenty of cynics focused on the government bonds' levels and the impact of U.S. fiscal profligacy, discounting the value in the trade as a result.Long-dated yields are moving lower in early Friday trading, and could rally even further next week if minutes from the Federal Reserve's May policy meeting hint another rate cut or a tamer-than-expected reading of the April's personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, inflation gauge.""[There is] nothing more contrarian in 2025 than being long the long-end, "" BofA writes. ""And while the 2020s spending of Biden's Build Back Better + taxation of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill don't a AAA-rating make, we say return of bond vigilantes to (the 5% level on 30-year Treasury yields) is a cyclical buy opportunity.""Write to editors@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"OpenAI's Biggest Data Center Secures $11.6 Billion in Funding, Crusoe Says — WSJ",1747819800000,"By Berber JinA Texas data center that the startup Crusoe is building for OpenAI has secured $11.6 billion in new funding commitments, expanding a site that is core to increasing the ChatGPT maker's long-term computing capabilities.The funding, a mixture of debt and equity, will expand the data center to eight buildings from two and increase the total amount secured for the project to $15 billion, Crusoe said. Both Crusoe and investment firm Blue Owl Capital are contributing cash to the data center project as part of the latest financing.The data center, which is slated for completion next year, is expected to be the largest used by OpenAI. Each of the buildings will run up to 50,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are commonly used for training large language models.The development of the Abilene site is a key step in reducing OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft in the race to build the next generation of AI models. For years, the startup exclusively relied on Microsoft for its computing power, but grew frustrated that the tech giant wasn't keeping up with demand. Last spring, it struck a deal with Oracle to use the Abilene site after receiving the signoff from Microsoft.Longer term, OpenAI aims to build and operate its own network of data centers. In January, Chief Executive Sam Altman unveiled a $500 billion infrastructure project called Stargate alongside the Japanese tech investor SoftBank and cloud firm Oracle. OpenAI said at the time that it was evaluating sites across the country for Stargate, though details have so far been scarce.Earlier this month, Altman posted a photo of him visiting the Abilene site on X, wearing an Oracle construction vest: ""great to see progress on the first stargate in abilene with our partners at oracle today. will be the biggest ai training facility in the world,"" he wrote.Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI separately struck an agreement with Oracle to rent servers from the facility. Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips.Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521003187:0/

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Salesforce and Microsoft,1747996020000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Salesforce CRM and Microsoft MSFT.Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down -2% Ahead of Earnings?Salesforce stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM's slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28.The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service.CRM's growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce's offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce's transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM's Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce's new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program ""agents"" for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development.Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said ""nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,"" and all of its ""top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.""The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, ""achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation."" The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce's AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company's EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT's 1,700% and Tech's 720%.Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector's 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft's 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech's 115% and Microsoft's 150%.CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech's 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM's PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

C3.ai Trading at a Premium at 6.39X: Time to Hold or Sell the Stock?,1747760040000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector’s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai’s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Google to unveil AI upgrades at I/O conference amid search challenges,1747746000000,"Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google kicks off its annual developer conference on Tuesday with a flurry of announcements showcasing its huge investment in artificial intelligence, while seeking to fend off concerns over the future of its business.The I/O conference in Mountain View, California has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's long-time stronghold organizing and retrieving information on the internet.In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's ChatGPT.Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta NASDAQ:META .Now, with consumer usage of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking how aggressive Google is in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue.Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple NASDAQ:AAPL executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari web browser for the first time.In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics.A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years.The analysts pointed to a behavioral shift drawing consumers towards AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines.Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser.Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs.Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries.Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a ""universal AI agent.""At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time.The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat.Meanwhile, Google is growing other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by ""millions"" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR121:0-google-to-unveil-ai-upgrades-at-i-o-conference-amid-search-challenges/"
Market Chatter: Microsoft-backed Builder.ai's Former Executives Said to Have Reported 'Bogus' Sales,1747935934000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed Builder.ai collapsed followed an internal inquiry, which found that the company's former executives allegedly reported ""bogus"" sales to the board, The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing people close to the matter. The provisional accounts submitted by the technology startup to its auditor showed that the company revised its 2024 revenue estimates to about $55 million from a previously reported estimate of $220 million. It also reduced its previously reported 2023 total sales revenue of $180 million to about $45 million, the report said, citing the people. The prior revenue figures were submitted to the board when founder Sachin Dev Duggal was CEO, the report said. Duggal resigned as CEO along with Builder.ai's Chief Revenue Officer Varghese Cherian in early 2025, according to the report. The people familiar with the matter said that sales, which were previously booked, remained outstanding for an extended period of time due to Duggal's departure, raising concerns regarding revenue recognition. This eventually led to hiring of a law firm by the board to investigate the matter. The law firm shared its findings, which showed that there may have been a coordinated effort to inflate revenue at the company, the report said.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Moody's, Broadcom, Microsoft and CoreWeave",1747743960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Moody's MCO, Broadcom AVGO, Microsoft MSFT and CoreWeave CRWV.U.S. Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech BoomsIn poker, a ""tell"" is a player's subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, ""If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?""Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market's resilient reaction to the Moody's downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The U.S. Lost Its Perfect Credit Rating. Who Still Has It. — Barrons.com,1747687980000,"By Anita HamiltonThe U.S. lost its top credit rating from Moody's over the weekend, but 11 other countries still have it.Those countries are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland.Companies also get rated by Moody's, which provides a globally recognized standard of creditworthiness. Among them, Apple, Johnson & Johnson, and Microsoft have a top credit rating too, along with government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders.Moody's global long-term rating scale is designed to reflect the risk that an entity — be it a company, a country, or financial vehicle such as mortgage-backed securities — will be able to meet financial obligations a year or more in the future.Those with the top rating, Aaa, are considered minimal risk, while the lowest, C, ""are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal and interest,"" according to Moody's.In downgrading the U.S. to Aa1 Friday, Moody's noted the ""increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.""Markets were closed Friday night when Moody's adjusted its rating for the U.S. After falling initially Monday morning, major indexes closed slightly up, with the Dow rising 0.3% and the S&P 500 up 0.1%.

Elon Musk's AI Just Landed on Microsoft Azure -- And It Might Change Everything,1747685190000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT is adding Elon Musk's Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini models to its Azure AI Foundry, deepening its reach into the generative AI battlefield. The move comes as part of Microsoft's broader strategy to become the go-to platform for building and deploying AI applications. With this addition, Azure now offers more than 1,900 model variantsincluding from OpenAI, Meta, and DeepSeekwhile Google and Anthropic remain noticeably absent. The inclusion of Grok follows a recent controversy where the model, embedded in Musk's social platform X, surfaced misleading contenta misstep xAI attributed to an unauthorized modification. Despite this, Microsoft is pressing ahead, offering developers more model optionality at a time when enterprise demand for flexibility is rising.At its annual Build developer conference, Microsoft showcased several updates aimed at strengthening its AI infrastructure. Among them: new tools to help businesses manage AI agentssoftware designed to act on a user's behalf. Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott emphasized that for agents to be useful, they need to talk to everything in the world. The company is also joining the steering committee for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, a technical standard that governs how AI systems interactdespite Anthropic's own models still being unavailable on Azure. Microsoft is clearly positioning itself not just as a cloud vendor, but as the connective tissue for AI innovation across the industry.The company's AI business is gaining traction fast. Microsoft previously guided to at least $13 billion in annualized revenue across its AI offerings, which include both infrastructure and application layers. At Build, it introduced a model leaderboard, a tool to recommend the best model for a given task, and new systems to help enterprises train AI using their proprietary data. The addition of Grok brings a high-profileif somewhat controversialplayer into Microsoft's expanding ecosystem.

"US Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech Booms",1747682700000,"US Stocks Brush Aside Moody’s DowngradeIn poker, a “tell” is a player’s subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody’s ( MCO ) credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, “If bad news can’t bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?”Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics Present BeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.Image Source: BeSpoke Investment Group The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom ( AVGO ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there’s anything baseball’s steroid era taught, it’s that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China. Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950 S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Image Source: Carson Investment ResearchBottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market’s resilient reaction to the Moody’s downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:bf8993135094b:0-us-stocks-brush-off-moody-s-echo-past-tech-booms/

""As CrowdStrike has acknowledged, its own president publicly stated CrowdStrike did something 'horribly wrong.'""The Atlanta-based judge also let Delta pursue a computer trespass claim, and a narrowed claim that CrowdStrike fraudulently promised not to introduce an ""unauthorized back door"" into the carrier's computers.In a statement on Monday, CrowdStrike's lawyer Michael Carlinsky said he was confident the judge will find Delta's case has no merit, or will limit damages to the ""single-digit millions of dollars"" under Georgia law.Delta, based in Atlanta, said it was pleased with the decision and remained confident in the merits of its case.The carrier sued Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike three months after the July 19, 2024 outage disrupted travel for 1.4 million Delta passengers.Delta has said the outage cost $550 million in lost revenue and added expenses, offset by $50 million of fuel savings.On May 6, a federal judge in Atlanta said Delta must face a proposed class action by passengers whose said it unlawfully refused full refunds after the outage upended their travel.The outage also disrupted other airlines, but those disruptions eased faster.The case is Delta Air Lines Inc v CrowdStrike Inc, Georgia Superior Court, Fulton County, No. 24CV013621.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RR0U2:0-delta-can-sue-crowdstrike-over-computer-outage-that-caused-7-000-canceled-flights/"
Microsoft Sues To Curb Lumma Stealer Threat,1747924465000,"On Wednesday, Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Digital Crimes Unit brought suit on May 13 against Lumma Stealer, an information-stealing malware used by hundreds of threat actors to siphon passwords, credit-card data, bank details and cryptocurrency wallets.Between March 16 and May 16, Microsoft detected over 394,000 Windows PCs infected with Luma Stealer, according to assistant general counsel Steven Masada in a company blog post. Leveraging a U.S. court order, the DCU seized or took down roughly 2,300 malicious domains forming Lumma's command-and-control backbone. Simultaneously, the Department of Justice disrupted the malware's central servers and online marketplaces, while Europol's EC3 and Japan's JC3 suspended locally based infrastructure nodesmarking one of the most extensive multinational takedowns of an info-stealer to date.The growth and resilience of Lumma Stealer highlights the broader evolution of cybercrime and underscores the need for layered defenses and industry collaboration to counter threats, Microsoft said in a separate post. Analysts note this legal offensive follows earlier DCU actions against other high-profile info-stealers and could pressure peers such as CrowdStrike NASDAQ:CRWD and Palo Alto Networks NASDAQ:PANW to accelerate feature rollouts. Compared with a similar takedown of TrickBot in October 2024, which involved 1,100 domains and an estimated 150,000 infections, this operation more than doubles the scale of disruption.Why It Matters This aggressive move not only hampers Lumma's infrastructure but also underscores Microsoft's growing role as both defender and regulator, signaling to investors its commitment to bolstering enterprise-security offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e4eb38b37094b:0-microsoft-sues-to-curb-lumma-stealer-threat/

SentinelOne Rises 25% in a Month: Should You Still Buy the Stock?,1747674840000,"SentinelOne ’s S shares have surged 25% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Security industry’s return of 19.4% and the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 22.8%. The recent outperformance can be attributed to the company’s strong AI-powered portfolio, rich partner base and expanding clientele despite stiff competition.In the cybersecurity space, SentinelOne is facing stiff competition from the likes of Okta OKTA, Broadcom AVGO and Microsoft MSFT. While Okta’s main focus is on identity management, Broadcom’s Symantec is a traditional legacy antivirus suite. Microsoft’s Defender suite is broadly integrated with its own operating system, lacking openness with third-party platforms.Meanwhile, SentinelOne’s Singularity platform is a complete AI-native and provides security at multiple levels, including endpoint, cloud, identity and data through a single interface. The Purple AI provides investigation, real-time threat detection and automated response through its generative AI-powered security analysis, substantially reducing the response time of enterprises. SentinelOne’s modular and multi-cloud compatible architecture gives it a first mover advantage compared to its peers as it offers a more modern and AI-driven solution to enterprises, leading the way into the future.However, SentinelOne stock has underperformed its competitors over the past month. Okta, Broadcom and Microsoft shares have appreciated 37.7%, 37.5% and 26.5%, respectively, over the same time.SentinelOne, Inc.

Microsoft to offer rival AI models from own data center; launches AI coding agent,1747670414000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT said on Monday it would offer new AI models made by Elon Musk 's xAI, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META and European startups Mistral and Black Forest Labs hosted in its own data centers, and unveiled a new artificial-intelligence tool designed to complete software coding tasks on its own.The announcements, made at Microsoft's annual Build software developer conference in Seattle, Washington, underscored the changing nature of Microsoft's relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Microsoft has backed and which announced a directly competing product last week.Microsoft has recently situated itself as a more neutral player in the AI arms race, showing less appetite to shell out huge sums of cash to fund OpenAI's research ambitions while also working with a broader array of AI players, all with an eye on expanding sales while keeping a lid on costs.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the new offerings from xAI, Meta and others will be provided with the same reliability guarantees that come with OpenAI models hosted by Microsoft.""That's just a game-changer in terms of how you think about models and model provisioning,"" Nadella told conference attendees during a keynote address. ""It's exciting for us as developers to be able to mix and match and use them all.""Microsoft's new GitHub Copilot feature is what is known as a coding agent, an AI tool designed to help developers with coding tasks. While previous iterations of Microsoft's AI coding tools could automatically generate bits of code based on what a developer was already doing, the agent is designed to go much further.The agent will take a few instructions from a human - such as a description of a software bug and a strategy for how to fix it - and then get to work, alerting the human to review its work once it has finished coding.OpenAI last week released a preview of a similar agent that it calls Codex.At the Build conference on Monday, Microsoft laid out a vision of a world in which businesses will craft agents of their own for various tasks inside a business. Its primary offering in that area is called Azure Foundry - a service that lets businesses build their own agents based on the AI model of their choice.Those agents are likely to be built with a mix of different AI models, Asha Sharma, corporate vice president for product of Microsoft AI platforms, told Reuters.Microsoft on Monday said it would offer xAI's Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models on its cloud services as well as Meta's Llama models and offerings from French startup Mistral and German startup Black Forest Labs, bringing the total number of models it offers to Azure customers to more than 1,900.Significantly, those models will run within Microsoft's own data centers, meaning Microsoft can make promises about their availability in an era when popular models are often plagued by outages when demand outstrips the capacity to serve them. Sharma said Microsoft plans to add more popular models soon.""One of the most important parts to be able to build an app and seamlessly use the most popular models is making sure your reserved capacity that you have with Azure OpenAI starts to work across the most popular models,"" Sharma said.Microsoft also said on Monday that it was creating a way for AI agents to have the same kind of digital identifier as human employees inside a company's systems.""The concept of treating agents as digital employees is the kind of groundbreaking change that will both open some impressive new capabilities but also raise concerns about the impact that AI is going to make in the workplace,"" said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR0U5:0-microsoft-to-offer-rival-ai-models-from-own-data-center-launches-ai-coding-agent/"

Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down 20% Before Earnings for AI Growth?,1747915200000,"Salesforce ( CRM )  stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM’s slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28. The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service. CRM’s growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce’s offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce’s transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft (MSFT) and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM’s Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce’s new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program “agents” for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development. Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said “nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,” and all of its “top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.”The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, “achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation.” The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce’s AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company’s EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT’s 1,700% and Tech’s 720%. Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector’s 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft’s 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech’s 115% and Microsoft’s 150%. CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech’s 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM’s PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:faad8e6f8094b:0-buy-this-megacap-tech-stock-down-20-before-earnings-for-ai-growth/

With businesses globally undergoing digital overhauls, Salesforce's commitment to aligning its product offerings with customer needs is likely to have boosted its revenues for the quarter.The growing demand for generative AI-enabled cloud solutions has been a major catalyst for Salesforce. By embedding generative AI tools across its products, the company not only enhances customer engagement but also strengthens its competitive position in the customer relationship management space. This forward-thinking approach might have significantly contributed to its top-line growth during the to-be-reported quarter.Salesforce’s ability to deepen relationships with leading brands across industries and expand its reach in key geographic markets remains a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company’s increasing footprint in the public sector is likely to have provided a further boost, unlocking new growth opportunities during the first quarter.The acquisitions of Spiff, Own and Zoomin have been pivotal in enhancing Salesforce's capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. These additions are likely to have driven higher subscription revenues, particularly across its core cloud services. Salesforce’s key cloud offerings, including Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data, are expected to have delivered robust growth.Our first-quarter revenue estimates for Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data cloud services are pegged at $2.14 billion, $2.34 billion, $1.84 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. We expect revenues of approximately $9.21 billion and $518.8 million for the Subscription and Support segment and the Professional Services division, respectively.The ongoing cost restructuring initiative is likely to have boosted Salesforce’s profitability in the first quarter. The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 33.1%, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of cost restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.CRM’s Price Performance & ValuationOver the past year, Salesforce shares have risen 1.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry’s growth of 10.4%. Compared to its peers, CRM stock has also underperformed other enterprise software makers, including SAP SE SAP, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT. Over the past year, shares of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have gained 53.1%, 26.7% and 6%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value Salesforce offers investors at the current levels. CRM stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.48X compared with the industry’s 9.25X.CRM stock also trades at a discounted multiple compared with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/S multiples of 8.38X, 6.77X and 10.87X, respectively.Investment Thesis for Salesforce StockSalesforce is the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management industry, consistently outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Gartner’s annual rankings reaffirm its top position year after year. Its ability to maintain this dominance stems from its expansive product suite, seamless integrations and innovative approach to enterprise solutions.Strategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in strengthening its market position. The $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack in 2021 significantly enhanced its collaboration capabilities, making Salesforce a comprehensive enterprise software provider. More recently, the $1.9-billion acquisition of Own Company in 2024 bolstered its data protection and AI capabilities, a move that aligns with growing enterprise priorities around security and automation.Salesforce’s AI initiatives further cement its leadership. Since introducing Einstein GPT in March 2023, the company has expanded its AI-driven functionalities across its entire ecosystem. This technology enhances automation, streamlines workflows and improves customer interactions, giving Salesforce a significant advantage as AI adoption accelerates across industries.Additionally, Salesforce is positioned to benefit from the continued rise in worldwide IT spending. Gartner projects global IT spending to reach $5.61 trillion in 2025, implying a 9.8% year-over-year increase. Enterprise software spending is expected to grow even faster, rising 14.2% year over year. As digital transformation remains a top priority for businesses, Salesforce is well-positioned to capture a substantial share of these increasing budgets.Conclusion: Hold CRM Stock Ahead of Q1 ResultsThe company’s leadership in customer relationship management, aggressive AI expansion and increasing enterprise IT spending trends create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Its ability to deliver earnings growth despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties makes the stock worth holding.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7c0b962d1094b:0-salesforce-gears-up-to-post-q1-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/

"Stock Market News for May 22, 2025",1747909440000,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday following spike in yields of long-dated U.S. sovereign bonds. Market participants remained concerned that the proposed tax-cut bill of President Trump will further worsen U.S. fiscal deficit. The U.S.-China tariff war also remained unresolved. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 1.9% or 816.80 points to close at 41,860.44. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and one finished in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 18,872.64, sliding 1.4% due to weak performance of technology bigwigs. Technology giants like Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities. As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February. Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:747eff640094b:0-stock-market-news-for-may-22-2025/
3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025.

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a0f366036094b:0-should-you-stay-invested-in-or-sell-coreweave-stock-post-q1-earnings/

Microsoft hosts developer conference as focus grows on AI profits,1747648800000,"Microsoft hosts its annual software developer conference in Seattle on Monday, drawing thousands of coders looking to turn the past years of investments into artificial intelligence into profitable products and services for consumers and businesses.The Redmond, Washington-based software giant, which is an investor and deep strategic partner with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and has already spent $64 billion this year, much of it on data centers needed for AI-based services such as Copilot used in its popular Microsoft 365 applications.But there are signs that Microsoft — whose shares are up more than 30% this year, defying a broader Nasdaq decline — is reworking its relationship with OpenAI and seeking to become a neutral arms dealer in the AI race.Earlier this year, Microsoft allowed OpenAI to branch out and work with Oracle on the massive ""Stargate"" data center project in Texas.Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella has argued the company can get expenses down, saying that once it settles on an algorithm and begins to optimize it, Microsoft can obtain 10 times better performance for the same computing costs.Demand for AI services in Microsoft's Azure cloud computing is also continuing to grow.Thomas Blakey, an equity analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said that the company is increasingly keeping revenue-generating AI services inside its own data centers, where it can continue to tweak them for better cost. It shifting to only using outside data center services such as CoreWeave, which is known as a ""neocloud"" that focuses on offering AI chips from Nvidia, when Microsoft needs short bursts of extra computing power for specific projects.""If they have to flex up in some way, they've been consistently saying that they're going to shift away from buying more data centers and dirt and cement and they're going to leave that to the neoclouds,"" Blakey told Reuters.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0TP:0-microsoft-hosts-developer-conference-as-focus-grows-on-ai-profits/"
Microsoft Could Rally as EU Antitrust Case Nears Resolution,1747855440000,"It didn’t really need much boosting, but Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT stock got more good news in a week when the market is looking for direction. The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its  market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a “clear and complete resolution” to its rivals’ concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft’s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it’s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it’s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That’s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it’s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it’s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft’s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft’s productivity applications.That’s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a “walled garden” effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company’s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock’s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock’s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average. Also, Microsoft’s estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11.35% is below its three-year average of 15.9%. From a technical standpoint, the move lower on May 21 dropped the stock below its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages, which may be a sign that a reversal is in place.While short-term volatility exists, Microsoft's strong fundamentals and market position suggest a favorable outlook for investors. Analysts continue to bid the stock higher. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give MSFT stock a Moderate Buy rating with a $512.63 price target that marks a 13% upside from its price on May 21.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:59be14231094b:0-microsoft-could-rally-as-eu-antitrust-case-nears-resolution/

Microsoft wants AI 'agents' to work together and remember things,1747615626000,"Microsoft envisions a future where any company's artificial intelligence agents can work together with agents from other firms and have better memories of their interactions, its chief technologist said on Sunday ahead of the company's annual software developer conference.Microsoft is holding its Build conference in Seattle on May 19, where analysts expect the company to unveil its latest tools for developers building AI systems.Speaking at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, ahead of the conference, Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott told reporters and analysts the company is focused on helping spur the adoption of standards across the technology industry that will let agents from different makers collaborate. Agents are AI systems that can accomplish specific tasks, such as fixing a software bug, on their own.Scott said that Microsoft is backing a technology called Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source protocol introduced by Google-backed Anthropic. Scott said MCP has the potential to create an ""agentic web"" similar to the way hypertext protocols that helped spread the internet in the 1990s.""It means that your imagination gets to drive what the agentic web becomes, not just a handful of companies that happen to see some of these problems first,"" Scott said.Scott also said that Microsoft is trying to help AI agents have better memories of things that users have asked them to do, noting that, so far, ""most of what we're building feels very transactional.""But making an AI agent's memory better costs a lot of money because it requires more computing power. Microsoft is focusing on a new approach called structured retrieval augmentation, where an agent extracts short bits of each turn in a conversation with a user, creating a roadmap to what was discussed.""This is a core part of how you train a biological brain - you don't brute force everything in your head every time you need to solve a particular problem,"" Scott said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RQ06N:0-microsoft-wants-ai-agents-to-work-together-and-remember-things/"

Nvidia's Huang set to showcase latest AI tech at Taiwan's Computex,1747609200000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA chief executive Jensen Huang is set to open the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Monday, where he is expected to discuss the company's advancements in artificial intelligence server systems, cloud computing products and robotics.Huang's 90-minute presentation will start at 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) at the Taipei Music Hall.Once primarily focused on the PC industry, the Santa Clara, California-based company has used its presence at Computex to launch new graphics cards for video games. Earlier this year, Nvidia unveiled a new line of graphics chips at the CES show in Las Vegas.But Nvidia has grown beyond its roots as a video game graphics chip maker into the dominant producer of chips that have powered the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry since ChatGPT's launch in 2022.Nvidia has been designing central processing units (CPUs) that would run Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Windows operating system and use technology from Arm Holdings NASDAQ:ARM , Reuters has previously reported.At Computex last year, Huang sparked ""Jensanity"" in Taiwan, as the public and media breathlessly followed the CEO, who was mobbed by attendees at the trade show. During the company's annual developer conference in March, Huang outlined how Nvidia would position itself to address the shift in computing needs from building large AI models to running applications based on them.In a more than two-hour speech, Huang unveiled several new generations of AI chips, including the Blackwell Ultra, which will be available later this year.The company's Rubin chips will be followed by Feynman processors, which are set to arrive in 2028.Nvidia also launched a desktop version of its AI chips, called DGX Spark, targeting AI researchers.Computex, which will run from May 20 to 23, is expected to have 1,400 exhibitors. It will be the first major gathering of computer and chip executives in Asia since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs to push companies to increase production in the U.S.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RN0W8:0-nvidia-s-huang-set-to-showcase-latest-ai-tech-at-taiwan-s-computex/"
Google Has Made Progress in AI. Its Challenge Is Making Products. — Barrons.com,1747848660000,"By Adam LevineThis article is from the free weekly Barron's Tech email newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox.Burying the Lead. At Google I/O, the search giant's annual developers conference, Alphabet-unit Google unveiled its answer to new AI search engines like Perplexity and ChatGPT, which are nipping at its heels. But Google Search's new ""AI Mode"" was buried beneath a blizzard of other announcements, some more important than others.Let's sort through it.Grinding Its Way to AI Relevance. Despite a decade of heavy investment into AI, Google wound up racing from behind when OpenAI's ChatGPT leapfrogged it in November 2022. While we still await some of the most advanced products that were announced at I/O, Google's underlying AI technology seems to be catching up through heavy investment and rapid iteration.Handicapped. AI Mode is an important step in Google's battle to stave off new competition from AI search engines. It pairs the benefits of AI with the power of Google Search's unparalleled web index. But the implementation shows how the search giant is handicapped in this battle.Accessing AI Mode requires an extra click, which will likely reduce usage. In designing the new interface element, Google had to be careful not to break the search experience that users know so well — type and hit return. Perplexity and ChatGPT don't have a legacy interface to serve, and they can make the AI search experience more natural.Making AI Is Hard, but It's Easier Than Making Products. AI announcements at I/O included AI Mode, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini Live, Gemini in Chrome, Veo 3, Imagen 4, Flow, Beam, Canvas, Agent Mode, and that doesn't include experimental products like Project Aura and Project Astra.Without looking it up, can anyone tell me what all these things do, and why I should use them? The product branding feels removed from the use case, potentially leading to customer confusion.This gets back to Google's longtime problem with turning tech into products. As tracked by the website KilledByGoogle.com, Google has shut down 296 products over the years. It has had 13 messaging apps, four of which are still going.Google's challenge is bringing all these strands together in a way that makes a simple pitch to users, the same way Search did in 1997.Making Agents Happen. One loud-and-clear message from both Google I/O and Microsoft's Monday Build conference is that AI ""agents"" are where these companies see the future. Agents are apps that work on top of an AI language model, automating a series of tasks from simple commands. Microsoft is pitching them to its business customers, while Google unveiled Agent Mode for consumer use.For Google, it's vital to maintain control of these AI personal assistants. Once let loose in a browser, these agents can go everywhere a human goes, including searching on Google. The issue is AI agents don't care about Google's advertising. At some point in the not-too-distant future, a large portion of web traffic may be AI agents. All ad-supported services, including Google Search, should find that troubling.But if Google is the one providing the agents, it can monetize them, making up for the loss of human traffic on the web.This Week in Barron's Tech- Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals.

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

IonQ Stock Jumps 21% Following Q1 Earnings Results: Still a Buy?,1747847700000,"IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company’s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share’s Price Performance Post Q1 Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ’s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ’s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ’s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions — Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq’s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella’s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ’s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts’ optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%. Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ’s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ’s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors. Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ’s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company’s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ’s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption. The recent 21% increase in share price following first-quarter 2025 earnings is more than just momentum; it reflects meaningful strategic progress.The $22-million commercial deal with EPB, expanding government partnerships like DARPA’s benchmarking initiative, and acquisitions that bolster capabilities in quantum internet infrastructure all underscore IonQ’s leadership in a rapidly evolving space.Despite high R&D expenses and integration risks, IonQ’s nearly $700 million cash position provides the financial flexibility to pursue innovation aggressively without compromising its long-term vision. While the stock’s valuation is lofty, the narrowing consensus loss estimates and reaffirmed guidance signal growing confidence in execution.For long-term investors willing to embrace volatility, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a company building the foundation of next-generation computing and secure communications.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:440e7a061094b:0-ionq-stock-jumps-21-following-q1-earnings-results-still-a-buy/

Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/

"David Tepper's Appaloosa Sells FedEx Stock, Alters Mag 7 Holdings — Barrons.com",1747426800000,"Al RootHedge funds are filing their required quarterly portfolio disclosures, a focus for investors who want to know what the "" smart money"" is doing.Appaloosa Management qualifies as smart money. It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%. Appaloosa might have taken profits in the latter and not see a turnaround coming for the former.

OpenAI's $3 Billion Power Play Could Upend the Future of Coding,1747422130000,"OpenAI is making a serious play for the future of software development. The company just launched Codex, a new AI agent built to write features, squash bugs, and run testsall within ChatGPT. Available first to paying users on Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans, Codex is powered by a customized version of OpenAI's o3 model, fine-tuned for engineering tasks. It's still early days, and the tool isn't fully autonomous yetbut OpenAI staff are already using it daily, and external testers like Cisco and Kodiak Robotics have jumped in to explore use cases ranging from automation to prototyping.The bigger story? OpenAI could be preparing to buy Windsurf, a fast-growing startup in the AI coding space, for about $3 billionpotentially the company's largest acquisition to date. That would put OpenAI in direct competition with Google NASDAQ:GOOG , Anthropic, and Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed GitHub, all of which are racing to build the best AI copilots for developers. Startups like Cursor-maker Anysphere are also drawing investor interest with tools that suggest code based on a developer's intent, and Windsurf sits right in the middle of that action. If the deal goes through, OpenAI wouldn't just be scaling Codexit could be buying its way into developer mindshare.Under the hood, Codex is being framed as a stepping stone toward full-blown AI agentssystems that can handle complex workflows with minimal human direction. Depending on the task, Codex might take anywhere from a minute to half an hour to complete a job, and OpenAI says it's seeing rapid improvement in the model's reasoning capabilities. Importantly, Codex was also trained to flag and reject malicious requests, addressing concerns around AI-generated malware. For now, OpenAI seems to be testing both the product and the market. But with billions on the table and demand growing fast, this could be a critical chapter in the arms race to own the future of AI-powered development.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:0b31af19e094b:0-openai-s-3-billion-power-play-could-upend-the-future-of-coding/

Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday.

Adobe Jumps 19% in a Month: Is There Any Momentum Left in the Stock?,1747843860000,"Adobe ADBE shares have jumped 19% in a month, reflecting its deepening Generative AI (Gen AI) focus and innovative Gen AI-powered portfolio. A pause in tariffs that reduced macroeconomic uncertainty also helped the stock. However, Adobe’s near-term prospects remain challenging given stiff competition in the AI and GenAI space from the likes of Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI, as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions. Adobe’s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Gen AI solutions.Stiff competition has negatively impacted Adobe shares, which have underperformed peers like Microsoft and document services & e-signature provider DocuSign DOCU over the past month, but outperformed Alphabet. Microsoft, DocuSign and Alphabet shares returned 24.9%, 20.9% and 8.2%, respectively, over the same timeframe. The challenging near-term prospect is expected to remain an overhang on the Adobe shares.ADBE Stock’s PerformanceAdobe shares are also overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of D. ADBE stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.28X compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.14X, Salesforce’s 6.61X, DocuSign’s 5.69X and Alphabet’s 5.90X.Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)So, what should investors do with Adobe shares right now? Let’s dig deep to find out.Can Adobe’s Innovative Portfolio Boost Prospects?Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns. Adobe launched Firefly Video Model-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, which leverages AI to instantly generate and expand the length of video and audio clips. Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe’s prospects. ADBE is infusing Gen AI innovations across its portfolio, including AI-first standalone and add-on products such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly App and Services, and GenStudio for Performance Marketing. These factors are expected to boost top-line growth.Adobe Offers Positive Guidance for FY25Adobe’s new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter). ADBE expects this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.For fiscal 2025, Digital Media Annual Recurring Revenue is now expected to grow roughly 11%. Digital Media segment revenues are expected to be between $17.25 billion and $17.40 billion. Digital Experience segment revenues are expected between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, while Digital Experience subscription segment revenues are expected between $5.375 billion and $5.425 billion.Adobe reaffirmed its total revenue guidance, which is expected between $23.30 billion and $23.55 billion ($21.51 billion in fiscal 2024). Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings are still expected between $20.20 and $20.50 ($18.42 per share in fiscal 2024).ADBE’s 2025 Estimate Revision Trend Shows DeclineFor fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $20.36 per share, down by 5 cents over the past 60 days.

What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?,1747413720000,"Income-hungry investors have been piling into ETFs that use options to deliver juicy dividends. We've seen a surge in launches of these products recently, as providers employ innovative strategies to package derivatives within the ETF structure to meet rising investor demand.In addition to offering high yields, these strategies generally help reduce portfolio volatility. However, investors should remember that there’s no free lunch in investing. These products tend to perform best in sideways markets and often underperform during strong bull runs. That said, they can provide some downside protection when stocks fall.Quantitative Researcher Roni Israelov refers to these strategies as a “Devil’s Bargain.” His research shows that trading options to generate income can undermine long-term investment returns.This paper is Roni’s personal research and not a work product of Citadel.Our own analysis of the most popular derivatives-backed ETFs also suggests that investors may be leaving significant returns on the table in their pursuit of high income. Nevertheless, these products have attracted substantial inflows this year, as market volatility has shaken investor confidence.The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses proprietary research to select around 130 stocks and writes S&P 500 Index call options to generate income. Its top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META.JEPI and its sister fund, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, are among the top asset gatherers this year.The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO aims to deliver high income from both dividends and covered calls. Its managers focus on high-quality large-cap companies with a history of dividend growth and write covered calls on individual stocks.While DIVO has outperformed JEPI, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term on a total return basis.JEPQ and the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD continue to underperform the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d14073830094b:0-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-options-income-etfs/
How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy.

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold INOD Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747411920000,"Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company’s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata’s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues — highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company’s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% — demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology — each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management’s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD’s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts’ bearish sentiments about the stock. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Magnitude - Consensus Estimate TrendINOD’s Valuation Looks StretchedInnodata's current valuation seems stretched, as evidenced by its one-year forward price-to-sales ratio of 4.31 — well above the Zacks Computer – Services industry average of 1.76. This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company’s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere’s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata. With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit. While long-term prospects look strong amid rising AI spending from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, near-term risks tied to customer concentration, execution and margin pressure remain.Given the southward revision of earnings estimates and the current valuation suggesting caution for new entrants, existing shareholders should consider holding, and new investors may wait for further validation of revenue diversification and pipeline conversion before adding to positions.INOD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Buy the Spike in Intuit (INTU) Stock After Earnings?,1748044980000,"Spiking +8% today, Intuit INTU stock made headlines after comfortably exceeding expectations for its fiscal third quarter after-market hours on Thursday.Sitting on gains of +15% year to date, Intuit stock has outperformed the broader market and many of its notable Zacks Computer-Software peers, including Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM.Not too far from its 52-week high of $734 a share, investors are surely wondering if there is more upside in store for the financial software giant’s stock, with generative AI starting to enhance Intuit’s accounting and tax preparation services. Intuit’s Q3 Results Thanks to its AI-driven solutions, Intuit’s Q3 sales of $7.75 billion eclipsed estimates of $7.54 billion and spiked from $6.73 billion a year ago. CEO Sasan Goodarzi stated Intuit is becoming a one-stop shop for AI agents and AI-enabled human experts. Notably, Intuit Assist offers a generative AI-powered financial assistant that helps users with tax filing, business insights, and financial decision-making. On the bottom line, Intuit's Q3 EPS of $11.65 rose 18% from $9.88 in the comparative quarter and topped expectations of $10.89 per share by nearly 7%. More intriguing, Intuit has now surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 13 consecutive quarters with an average earnings surprise of 12.15% in its last four quarterly reports. Intuit's Revenue Guidance Serving as a further catalyst to Friday’s rally was that Intuit raised its full-year revenue guidance and now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be between $18.72 billion-18.76 billion, up from previous estimates of $18.16 billion-$18.35 billion. This came in above Zacks' estimates of $18.28 billion or 12% growth (Current Year below). Zacks' projections currently call for Intuit’s total sales to increase another 12% in FY26 to $20.48 billion.Monitoring Intuit’s P/E Valuation Following its post-earnings rally, Intuit stock is trading at a 34.5X forward earnings multiple, which is on par with Microsoft but a premium to its industry average of 27.3X, with Salesforce at 25.5X. However, INTU does trade well below its decade-long high of 87.2X forward earnings and offers a 23% discount to its median of 44.9X during this period. Bottom LineFor now, Intuit stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q3 report. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way as earnings estimate revisions could trend higher in the coming weeks, considering Intuit’s elevated revenue guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2309070b7094b:0-buy-the-spike-in-intuit-intu-stock-after-earnings/
Market Chatter: Crusoe Receives $11.6 Billion in Funding for OpenAI Data Center in Texas,1747825916000,"Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's partner Crusoe has received $11.6 billion in new funding commitments for a data center in Abilene, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The funding, which will come from a mixture of debt and equity provided by Blue Owl Capital (OWL) and Crusoe, will expand the data center to eight buildings from its previously planned two, each equipped with up to 50,000 Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Blackwell chips, the report said. Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle NYSE:ORCL agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI agreed to rent servers from Oracle while Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips, according to the report. OpenAI, Blue Owl, Crusoe, and Oracle did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250521:A3382614:0/
Microsoft Makes Fresh Bid to End EU Antitrust Probe Over Teams — 2nd Update,1747411800000,"By Edith HancockMicrosoft made concessions to avert a potentially heavy fine from European Union officials who are probing how the tech giant offers its Teams platform to customers in the bloc.Officials from the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, are now seeking feedback on Microsoft's concessions, the antitrust body said Friday. Microsoft offered to make its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites available without Teams at a reduced rate and allow existing customers to switch to using those suites without Teams.The company also pledged to offer platforms that compete with Teams better interoperability with Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to facilitate using competing products.Microsoft also said that if the commitments become binding, it will align its worldwide suites offers and pricing with its EU plans, the commission said. The regulator is now asking for feedback from rivals and customers on those commitments.If regulators ultimately accept Microsoft's offer, it would end a long-running probe into the tech giant's packaging of Teams--which provides video calls and other kinds of office collaboration tools--with its office products sparked by a complaint from rival Slack in 2020.It accused Microsoft of bundling Teams with its office suites, giving it an unfair advantage over other platforms. German software group Alfaview also complained to the EU regulator.The tech giant had previously tried to appease the commission, offering to split off Teams from its suites in Europe in 2023 and then extending that offer globally, but officials said earlier adjustments were insufficient to ease their concerns and sent a formal statement of objections to the company in June last year.Nanna-Louise Linde, Microsoft's vice president of European government affairs, said in a blog post on Friday that the commitments ""represent a clear and complete resolution to the concerns raised by our competitors and will provide European customers with more choices.""Sabastian Niles, president and chief legal officer of Slack owner Salesforce, said that the company would carefully scrutinize Microsoft's offer.Write to Edith Hancock at edith.hancock@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250516005454:0-microsoft-makes-fresh-bid-to-end-eu-antitrust-probe-over-teams-2nd-update/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife.

For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed.

Microsoft Is Rolling Out AI Agents. Developers Are Finding Coding Errors. — Barrons.com,1748032800000,"By Adam LevineThis past week saw two tech titans fighting for attention with dueling developer conferences: Microsoft Build and Google I/O. Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI ""agents."" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, ""fix the build error on apple platforms,"" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. ""How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?"" one developer asked on GitHub.""We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,"" another developer on GitHub said. ""Is the ROI even worth it?""The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: ""We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.""As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers.

"OpenAI, Google, xAI battle for superstar AI talent, shelling out millions",1747821600000,"The contest in Silicon Valley to dominate artificial intelligence is playing out on a new court: superstar researchers.While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters.“The AI labs approach hiring like a game of chess,” said Ariel Herbert-Voss, CEO of cybersecurity startup RunSybil and a former OpenAI researcher who entered the talent fight after launching his own company. “They want to move as fast as possible, so they are willing to pay a lot for candidates with specialized and complementary expertise, much like the game pieces. They are like, do I have enough rooks? Enough knights?”Companies including OpenAI and Google, eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called “ICs” – the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies.Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI’s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech’s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman’s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources – both people and compute – behind the work he was excited about.“It was actually financially not the best option that I had,” he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers. That hasn’t stopped companies from throwing millions of dollars in bonuses and pay packages at star researchers, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever’s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said.Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said. Google declined to comment.In contrast, top engineers at big tech companies receive an average yearly compensation of $281,000 in salary and $261,000 in equity, according to Comprehensive.io, a company that tracks tech industry compensation.10,000x TALENTWhile talent has always been important in Silicon Valley, the difference with the AI boom is how few people are in this elite group – depending on who you ask, the number could range from a few dozen to around a thousand, eight sources told Reuters.That is based on the belief that this very small number of ‘ICs’ have made outsized contributions to the development of large language models, the technology today’s AI boom is based on, and therefore could make or break the success of an AI model. “sure 10x engineers are cool but damn those 10,000x engineer/researchers…,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted in late 2023, alluding to a long held maxim that the best software engineers were 10 times as good as the average (10x), but now in the AI industry, the best researchers are 10,000 times (10,000x) as effective as the average.The September departure of OpenAI’s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, who then founded a rival AI startup, has intensified the AI talent war. Murati, who was known at OpenAI for her management skills and execution prowess, recruited 20 OpenAI employees before announcing her company in February. She has now lured even more researchers from OpenAI and other labs, and the team is now around 60 people, two sources told Reuters. Though the company has no product in the market, Murati is in the middle of closing record-breaking seed round that is, based on the team’s strength. A representative for Murati declined to comment.The scarcity of talent has forced companies to approach hiring creatively. Zeki Data, a data firm focused on identifying top AI talent, said it is employing sports industry data analysis techniques like the one popularized by the movie ""Moneyball"" to identify promising but undiscovered talent. For instance, Zeki Data discovered Anthropic has been hiring researchers with theoretical physics backgrounds, and other AI companies have hired individuals with quantum computing backgrounds.Anthropic did not reply to a request for comment.“On my team, I have extraordinarily talented mathematicians who wouldn't have come to this field if it weren't for the fast progress that we're seeing now,” said Sébastien Bubeck, who left his role as vice president of GenAI research at Microsoft last year to join OpenAI. “We're seeing an influx of talent from all fields going into AI now. And some of these people are very, very clever, and they make a difference.”","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR0XL:0-openai-google-xai-battle-for-superstar-ai-talent-shelling-out-millions/"
Microsoft Could Settle EU Antitrust Probe by Mid-June,1747410112000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT is seeking to defuse EU antitrust scrutiny by offering Office suites without Teams at a reduced price and has drawn the European Commission's request for public feedback on its proposed commitments. Under the plan, Microsoft would sell versions of Office 365 and related productivity bundles without Teams, let customers switch to Teams-free suites mid-contract, enhance interoperability for rival communication apps, and guarantee data portability out of Teams; most obligations run for seven years, while interoperability and portability commitments extend to ten years. The EC said interested parties have until mid-June to submit their views, reflecting its June 2024 statement of objections that accused Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in SaaS productivity apps since April 2019, following Slack's original 2020 complaint. Shares were little changed in premarket trading, trading flat at recent levels. The move follows earlier reports that Microsoft could avoid a hefty EU fine after unpacking its latest offer, and underscores management's aim to balance regulatory concessions without diluting its product bundle strategy. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has signaled that these commitments, if approved, would settle the formal investigation opened in July 2023, but stakeholder feedback will shape any final order. For investors, the proposed remedy could remove a major overhang on Microsoft's valuation in Europe, where cloud and Office subscription growth are core drivers of its double-digit revenue gains. With Azure and AI strategy already cementing long-term growth, resolving the Teams bundling case would help ensure continued momentum in Microsoft's largest non-U.S. market. Investors will watch for the EC's decision after the consultation period closes in the coming weeks.GuruFocus's latest 12-month consensus price target for Microsoft sits at $503.52, implying an 11.1% upside from current levels. The high estimate of $650 signals that some analysts see as much as a 43% rally over the next year, while the low target of $423 suggests limited downside of about 7%.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:f3d37a584094b:0-microsoft-could-settle-eu-antitrust-probe-by-mid-june/

Will AI Empower the PR Industry or Create Endless Seas of Spam? — WSJ,1747821600000,"By Patrick CoffeePublic-relations agencies email reporters every day with suggestions to cover their clients, but this pitch from March stood out from the flood with its unusual subject line: ""You care more about Tesla than a cancer killing thousands.""The email went on to scold U.S.-based reporters for giving priority to Tesla earnings news and celebrity gossip over the work of Mainz Biomed, a German firm that develops tests for colorectal cancer.After rattling off statistics about increasing cancer rates, it stated, ""This isn't a future problem. It's happening right now. But you wouldn't know, because you've been covering crap that doesn't matter. Do better.""This pitch was generated entirely by an artificial intelligence tool called PRAI, which suggested getting reporters' attention by combining the well-known Tesla name with a confrontational tone, according to Valentin Saitarli, who is chief executive of PRAI and managing director of Exclusive PR Solutions, a public relations firm that represents Mainz Biomed.It succeeded in generating attention — and hostility.""This was an extremely efficient pitch and made lots of people angry, very angry,"" Saitarli said. ""We just wanted to showcase the product and invite to interviews, but we were attacked by so much hate."" Mainz Biomed didn't respond to requests for comment.Is this the future of public relations?The email is an extreme example of AI being applied to PR without proper human oversight, according to communications veterans. But the field is already being changed by AI in other ways.Nearly every major PR firm has named an AI leader, and they have also developed a range of proprietary tools.Edelman, the largest global PR firm by revenue, has built a ""generative engine optimization"" tool to improve clients' image among large language models as search results become less about driving clicks than maintaining reputations.When a client is the subject of negative headlines, the PR firm Golin can use AI to track more real-time responses and test potential responses on synthetic focus groups created by large language models, said Jeff Beringer, chief AI officer at the agency, part of Interpublic Group of Cos.The rise of generative AI has also facilitated a new wave of startups that automatically generate news releases and emails or cater to more niche PR functions.PodPitch was specifically designed to help communications professionals land their clients on podcasts, said co-founder Neal Shulman. Its product uses AI to match users' topical keywords with transcriptions from thousands of podcast episodes and generate personalized pitch emails based on clients' qualifications and the shows they are targeting, Shulman said.Big companies are also deploying AI for their own PR, communications and promotional activities.Microsoft last year developed a generative AI interface that summarizes mentions of Microsoft in news stories, podcasts and social-media posts so its communications team can more quickly develop a response strategy, said Steve Clayton, vice president of communications strategy at Microsoft.The company also uses its Copilot AI tool to develop social-media posts, conduct research and prepare executives for public speeches, but never releases any sort of AI-influenced content without thorough human review, according to Clayton.""We're using it more as an input into the process than an output from the process,"" he said.When food delivery service Grubhub conducted research for a 2024 promotion that focused on meals for women who had just given birth, survey respondents rated sushi and shellfish as their biggest cravings.But when Grubhub used AI-powered facial recognition technology to scrutinize participants' expressions, they saw much greater enthusiasm for cold cuts and sandwiches. Grubhub subsequently edited the campaign's main video to include more comfort foods.""You get a much better, more honest read on how they were feeling about that content versus what they say, because, you know, people are liars sometimes,"" said Dave Tovar, Grubhub's senior vice president of communications and government relations.AI has complicated the jobs of PR people as well.The technology made email outreach less effective by encouraging an ever-larger deluge of spam messages, according to Nick Toso, CEO and co-founder of Rolli, a tool that connects reporters with subject matter experts for their stories.It has also increased the prevalence of artificial ""experts"" designed to trick journalists into quoting their commentary and boosting affiliated businesses' search engine rankings, said Toso, who was previously Washington, D.C., bureau chief and senior producer at CNN's Spanish-language division.Rolli uses AI tools and a team of human researchers to validate experts' identities and qualifications through extensive reviews of their articles, social-media posts and résumés, said Toso.""If we're trying to tell people who the reliable sources are, we should also be able to tell them who the unreliable sources are,"" he said.PR shops can similarly vet influencers for clients more quickly by using AI to review years' of content, thereby ensuring that no past posts or comments could derail a brand's campaign.Some communications professionals remain skeptical that AI can encroach upon the discipline as quickly or as thoroughly as it has in the case of advertising.Communications relies more heavily on the nuances of one-on-one engagement between real humans, according to Wendy Zajack, adjunct faculty at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.Automation and AI-generated content risk getting in the way of that, according to Zajack, and bothering journalists to boot.""I do feel like we might see an allergic reaction to some of this in terms of seeking out really interesting, individualistic content and messaging, because we have just been inundated with a lot of crap,"" she said.Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521003374:0/

According to the report, the Texas data center is expected to be the largest used by OpenAI.The development of the Abilene data center could be a crucial step for the ChatGPT parent as it looks to expand key infrastructure necessary for tackling complex tasks employed by generative AI, while reducing dependence on its backer Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT .""Our customer is Oracle. OpenAI is Oracle's customer,"" Crusoe said in an emailed statement.Crusoe, along with Blue Owl's Real Assets platform and Primary Digital Infrastructure, will sponsor the construction of the six new buildings, it said.Each of the buildings will feature up to 50,000 of Nvidia's Blackwell AI chip systems.OpenAI and Nvidia did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RT0O7:0-neocloud-crusoe-secures-11-6-billion-funding-for-texas-data-center/"
Microsoft's AI Bet Just Took a Wild Turn -- And It's Not What You Think,1747408345000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT is making a bold pivot. After Chinese upstart DeepSeek dropped its open-source AI model R1with performance comparable to OpenAI at a tiny fraction of the costSatya Nadella didn't panic. He leaned in. Within days, Microsoft engineers were testing R1, vetting it for security, and plugging it into Azure. Customers can now rent R1 next to OpenAI's priciest tools, and Microsoft still takes a cut. Nadella's bet? AI is rapidly becoming a commodityand when that happens, the real power sits with whoever owns the pipes, not the product.But the bigger story is unfolding behind the scenes. Microsoft's once-cozy relationship with OpenAI has cooled. The four-day leadership coup at OpenAI in late 2023where Sam Altman was fired, hired by Microsoft, then reinstatedshook the partnership. Nadella, once the startup's biggest backer, is now hedging hard. He's ramped up development of in-house models like MAI-2, poached the entire Inflection AI team for $650 million, and is building cheaper, task-specific models that can run Copilot without OpenAI at all. One Microsoft exec called it insurancein case the startup's rocketship hits turbulence.Despite the drama, Microsoft's grip on the enterprise stack is holding strong. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies use Copilot. GitHub Copilot now has more than 15 million users. And while many employees quietly prefer ChatGPT, Microsoft keeps winning the infrastructure game. It doesn't matter if the AI brain behind Copilot comes from OpenAI, DeepSeek, or Microsoft's own labswhat matters is that it runs on Azure, integrates with Teams, and sells add-ons like Copilot Studio. Nadella's endgame isn't to win the model race.

How Should You Play Nebius Stock Going Into Q1 Earnings?,1747402560000,"Nebius Group N.V . NBIS will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 20, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 45 cents. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past seven days but has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $63.8 million.Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company. Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS’ Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS’ Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will ‍boast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. These behemoths already have a global-scale AI cloud, whereas NBIS is still expanding its infrastructure. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market.NBIS Stock PerformanceNebius shares have lost 19.5% over the past three months, underscoring broader and company-specific challenges. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector decline of 5.1% and the Zacks Internet Software Services industry’s gain of 4.3%.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its peers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 11.3% and 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame, while Microsoft has gained 10.7%.NBIS' ValuationIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 2.59X, lower than the Internet Software Services industry’s ratio of 4.12, but it could mean more risk than opportunity.Investment Thesis for NBIS StockGiven Nebius' ongoing investments in its core AI infrastructure platform and promising growth in Toloka and Avride platforms, long-term potential remains. However, significant margin pressure owing to ongoing investments and fierce competition from behemoths clouds the outlook. The negative Earnings ESP and muted stock performance further temper expectations. Retaining NBIS stock ahead of earnings appears prudent, but cautious optimism is warranted.What to Do With NBIS Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds in the AI space, it is an exciting growth story, but one with competitive pressures that investors must closely monitor.NBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:fdddaf27b094b:0-how-should-you-play-nebius-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/

The updated May 5 proposal ""does not adequately"" protect governance safeguards, which are about whether the startup ""would continue to have a legally enforceable obligation to advance the charitable mission above all else,"" the letter said. The group, in its April 17 letter to the attorneys general, raised concerns regarding OpenAI's proposed restructuring that would hand over control of the development and deployment of artificial general intelligence to a for-profit enterprise from a nonprofit charity. The Monday letter also said that under the May 5 updated proposal, the only difference is that OpenAI-nonprofit would have ""some"" form of control over OpenAI-public benefit corporation, where directors would not have a ""primary fiduciary duty"" to carry forward the startup's charitable mission ""above all else.""""As the Attorneys General of OpenAI-nonprofit's state of incorporation and the location where its charitable assets are held, you have the authority and responsibility to protect OpenAI-nonprofit's charitable mission and assets,"" the group wrote. The group said that it is not minimizing the ""significance"" of the proposed changes, but it emphasizes to ""underscore the singular importance"" of ensuring that the startup continues to have a ""legally enforceable obligation"" towards the charitable mission. Microsoft referred MT Newswires to OpenAI for comment. ""OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, is today a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit,"" an OpenAI spokesperson referred MT Newswires to the startup's May 5 blog. ""That will not change,"" OpenAI said in the blog. ""We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. We look forward to advancing the details of this plan in continued conversation with them, Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners,"" OpenAI also added in the blog. The offices of the attorneys general did not respond to MT Newswires' requests for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250516:A3380474:0/
Nvidia (NVDA) Hits Reset as Cloud Spending Slows,1748023282000,"Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) is switching gears. With cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and Google tightening the purse strings, Nvidias no longer betting only on mega AI builds.CEO Jensen Huang just rolled out NVLink Fusiontech that lets outside chips link up with Nvidias platform. Its a smart hedge: stay relevant, even when the big checks slow down.Hes also targeting regular businesses now, not just tech titans. Think: new servers built for the rest of us.Meanwhile, Chinas getting tougher. U.S. export limits mean Nvidia is selling weaker chips thereand losing ground.Sure, Nvidia has closed some giant AI deals in the Gulf. But analysts say those are exceptions, not the norm.Behind the scenes, Taiwans still doing the heavy lifting. Solomon Technology stock popped 241% after Huang gave it a shoutout. Thats how tight the partnership runs.Huangs not sweating the slowdown. He says AI demand is still strongthis is just a breather.Still, selling to businesses takes time.

Evercore Says Microsoft Could Hit $500 Target,1747400944000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT remains a compelling long-term buy as its AI-driven Azure growth and robust valuation work in its favor, Evercore ISI says. Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne note MSFT trades at 29x CY26 GAAP EPS, offering an attractive risk/reward balance at current levels, and highlight Azure's AI-consumption run rate surpassing $14 billion alongside sustained 30%+ year-over-year segment growth. They also point out that M365 Copilot revenues hit a $2.5 billion run rate, underscoring the early days of enterprise AI adoption. Shares rebounded from a 17-month low in early April, climbing double digits over the past month and closing within striking distance of last summer's all-time high. Evercore's Outperform rating and $500 price target reflect that conviction. Materne adds that as AI capacity scales and the non-AI side of Azure stabilizes, the cloud arm should sustain 30%+ revenue gains through FY26 and FY27, even assuming some normalization in legacy workloads. He also flags that Microsoft's diversified software moatfrom Office 365 subscriptions to Dynamics and gamingprovides downside protection amid broader tech-sector multiple contraction this year. Evercore's bullish stance contrasts with sector skepticism, where tech multiples have dipped amid rising rates, but MSFT's combination of subscription resilience and AI leadership sets it apart. To further engage investors, Evercore is hosting its annual Microsoft 360 Day next Tuesday, where management is expected to detail data-center expansion plans and AI roadmap milestones. For investors, Microsoft's proven AI monetization and consistent Azure expansion signal durable catalysts that may underpin sustained upside and justify holding through market cycles. Investors will eye FY26 guidance and insights from Microsoft 360 Day next week as key catalysts.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:23b017177094b:0-evercore-says-microsoft-could-hit-500-target/
U.S. Treasuries Might Be Wildly Undervalued. Here's an Example. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"By Martin BaccardaxImagine an innovation-driven global powerhouse, with interests and influence in virtually every country in the world, that ratings companies trust as a fail-safe bet to use investors' borrowed cash wisely and return it timely.Just a few months ago, you could have reliably used that description to characterize the U.S. government and its Treasury bonds. Today, investors are essentially saying the same thing about Microsoft. But that doesn't mean investors should trade in their Treasuries for the Windows and AI-backed paper just yet.Yields on the short-term bonds issued by the world's most valuable company — an AAA-rated tech giant that generates more than $60 billion in year in free cash flow — are trading lower than the yields on equivalent U.S. Treasury notes — from an Aa1-rated government that takes in $4.9 trillion in taxes each year. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields, and lower yields often signify that investors see less risk in holding those securities.For debt with longer maturities, the extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to own Microsoft's 30-year bond — instead of allegedly risk-free 30-year Treasuries — is just 20 basis points. That's the lowest on record, according to data from Bank of America's weekly 'Flow Show' report, and down from more than 100 basis points just two years ago. (One hundred basis points equals one percentage point.)Now, as an investor, there are two possible rationales for this: One, you either think the likelihood of Microsoft paying its coupon on time over the next three decades, and making you whole at the end, is roughly the same as the U.S. government, or, two, you think U.S. Treasuries are wildly undervalued.Signals from BofA's 'Flow Show' report suggest it might be the latter.The 10-year rolling return for a basket of longer-dated Treasuries, based on current pricing, turned negative for the first time in decades this year, according to BofA figures. The return of around -1.3%, in fact, matched the ""humiliating place stock returns were"" during the market's trough in February 2009, during the global financial crisis, the bank said.Sharp-eyed readers will note, of course, that stocks bottomed out the following month and embarked on the longest bull run in financial market history, with the S&P 500 delivering annualized returns of 17.8% for each of the next 10 years.U.S. Treasuries might not be ready for that kind of roaring gain. But after Moody's stripped the government of its coveted AAA-status last week and 30-year bond yields topped 5.15% earlier this week, the highest since 2007, investors are starting to see value.Around $25 billion in new money found its way into bond portfolios in the latest week, BofA's flow report indicated, outpacing the $16 billion moved into cash. Stock funds, meanwhile, suffered their first outflows in two months, losing $4.1 billion even as the S&P 500 rallied to within 3% of its all time high.Oscar Wilde once noted that a cynic is the sort of person that knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. As Treasuries sold off this week, there appeared to be plenty of cynics focused on the government bonds' levels and the impact of U.S. fiscal profligacy, discounting the value in the trade as a result.Long-dated yields are moving lower in early Friday trading, and could rally even further next week if minutes from the Federal Reserve's May policy meeting hint another rate cut or a tamer-than-expected reading of the April's personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, inflation gauge.""[There is] nothing more contrarian in 2025 than being long the long-end, "" BofA writes. ""And while the 2020s spending of Biden's Build Back Better + taxation of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill don't a AAA-rating make, we say return of bond vigilantes to (the 5% level on 30-year Treasury yields) is a cyclical buy opportunity.""Write to editors@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Microsoft makes Office-Teams offer to avert EU antitrust fine,1747392864000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT has offered to make its Office product without Teams cheaper than when sold with Teams, EU antitrust regulators said on Friday, which could spare the company a big fine and ease tensions with the United States.The European Commission said it would seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Reuters was the first to report the proposal earlier this week.If accepted, it would end a long-running case triggered by a 2020 complaint from Salesforce-owned NYSE:CRM Slack, which could have resulted in a massive antitrust fine for the U.S. tech giant. Germany's alfaview also complained.Microsoft's Vice President for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde said in a blogpost the proposal was a clear and complete resolution to concerns raised by rivals and would give Europeans more choice.Its offer would allow Europeans to buy Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams for less than corresponding suites that include Teams, the EU competition enforcer said.Microsoft said the maximum price differential between the two suites would be 8 euros ($9).The proposal would also allow rivals to inter-operate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functionalities, embed Office web applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in their own products, and integrate their products in Microsoft's core productivity applications.Customers in Europe would be able to extract their Teams messaging data for use in competing solutions. The pricing offer would be valid for seven years and interoperability for 10 years.Microsoft, which has accrued 2.2 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in past years, said it would align the options and pricing for its suites and Teams service globally if the EU regulator accepts its offer.""We are hopeful that following the market test, the European Commission will conclude that the proposed commitments resolve its concerns and in the following months adopt a final decision closing its investigation,"" Microsoft's Linde said.Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.

"OpenAI's Biggest Data Center Secures $11.6 Billion in Funding, Crusoe Says — WSJ",1747819800000,"By Berber JinA Texas data center that the startup Crusoe is building for OpenAI has secured $11.6 billion in new funding commitments, expanding a site that is core to increasing the ChatGPT maker's long-term computing capabilities.The funding, a mixture of debt and equity, will expand the data center to eight buildings from two and increase the total amount secured for the project to $15 billion, Crusoe said. Both Crusoe and investment firm Blue Owl Capital are contributing cash to the data center project as part of the latest financing.The data center, which is slated for completion next year, is expected to be the largest used by OpenAI. Each of the buildings will run up to 50,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are commonly used for training large language models.The development of the Abilene site is a key step in reducing OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft in the race to build the next generation of AI models. For years, the startup exclusively relied on Microsoft for its computing power, but grew frustrated that the tech giant wasn't keeping up with demand. Last spring, it struck a deal with Oracle to use the Abilene site after receiving the signoff from Microsoft.Longer term, OpenAI aims to build and operate its own network of data centers. In January, Chief Executive Sam Altman unveiled a $500 billion infrastructure project called Stargate alongside the Japanese tech investor SoftBank and cloud firm Oracle. OpenAI said at the time that it was evaluating sites across the country for Stargate, though details have so far been scarce.Earlier this month, Altman posted a photo of him visiting the Abilene site on X, wearing an Oracle construction vest: ""great to see progress on the first stargate in abilene with our partners at oracle today. will be the biggest ai training facility in the world,"" he wrote.Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI separately struck an agreement with Oracle to rent servers from the facility. Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips.Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521003187:0/

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:META vs. MSFT: Which AI Superpower Is a Better Buy?Meta Platforms and Microsoft have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies.Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month.Microsoft is now extending Copilot’s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft. Since April 2, Microsoft shares have appreciated 18.6% while Meta Platforms returned 12.8%.META & MSFT’s Earnings Estimate Revisions PositiveThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for META’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.52 per share, up by 2.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 6.96% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Meta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 2% to $13.30 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 12.71% growth over 2024.Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteBoth META’s and MSFT’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. Meta Platforms’ average surprise of 17.3% is better than Microsoft’s surprise of 5.21%, reflecting good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: META is Cheaper Than MSFTBoth Meta Platforms and Microsoft are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Meta Platforms shares are trading at 8.57X, lower than Microsoft’s 10.9X.ConclusionAlthough both Microsoft and Meta Platforms are leveraging AI to boost their prospects Microsoft is better positioned compared with META given strong adoption of Copilot, Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business.Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Meta Platforms, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA, Bank of America, Microsoft and Oracle",1747392000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL.Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million.NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China.Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years.Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA?Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products.Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips.While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price.This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock.However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

FTC Drops Case Against Microsoft-Activision Deal,1747997151000,"The US Federal Trade Commission said Thursday it has officially dismissed its complaint challenging Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT acquisition of Activision Blizzard, following a failed bid to block the deal in federal court. The agency cited a May 7 ruling by the Ninth Circuit, which upheld a lower court's decision denying the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction against the transaction. The FTC said it determined that continuing administrative litigation would not serve the public interest. The dismissal effectively ends the Commission's efforts to unwind Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of the game publisher behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, it said. The case is now closed, with no further action expected from the agency, the FTC said. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384394:0/

Microsoft Offers to Unbundle Teams From Office Amid EU Antitrust Probe,1747391619000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT has proposed to sell Office without Teams at a lower price and improve interoperability for rivals, the European Commission said Friday. The European agency said the move addresses EU antitrust concerns over Microsoft abusing its dominant position in the market for SaaS productivity applications by bundling Teams with Office 365. Under the proposal, the customers could opt for Office without Teams-even under existing contracts-and migrate data to rival platforms, the European Commission said. The implementation of the commitments would last up to 10 years and be overseen by a monitoring trustee, the European Commission said, adding that the monitoring trustee will also mediate in case of disputes between third parties and Microsoft and report regularly to the Commission.

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Salesforce and Microsoft,1747996020000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Salesforce CRM and Microsoft MSFT.Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down -2% Ahead of Earnings?Salesforce stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM's slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28.The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service.CRM's growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce's offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce's transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM's Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce's new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program ""agents"" for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development.Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said ""nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,"" and all of its ""top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.""The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, ""achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation."" The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce's AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company's EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT's 1,700% and Tech's 720%.Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector's 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft's 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech's 115% and Microsoft's 150%.CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech's 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM's PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

EU Seeks Feedback on Microsoft's Offer to End Teams Antitrust Investigation — Update,1747391100000,"By Edith HancockThe European Commission is seeking feedback on concessions Microsoft has offered in a bid to end an antitrust investigation into how it offers its Teams platform to customers in the European Union.The Commission said Friday that Microsoft has offered to make its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites available without Teams at a reduced rate and allow existing customers to switch to using those suites without Teams.

C3.ai Trading at a Premium at 6.39X: Time to Hold or Sell the Stock?,1747760040000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector’s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai’s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels. C3.ai currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:97dfa7506094b:0-c3-ai-trading-at-a-premium-at-6-39x-time-to-hold-or-sell-the-stock/

"Microsoft, Google Events Provide Opportunity to Close Gap With OpenAI, Wedbush Says",1747754484000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google's developer conferences are vital events in the artificial intelligence revolution as the companies plan to catch up with OpenAI, Wedbush said in a note Tuesday. The Microsoft Build and Google I/O conferences prioritize seeking developers to create AI apps and use cases on their platforms as agentic AI transformation speeds up, analysts including Daniel Ives said. Microsoft detailed at its ongoing conference how AI agents are enabling companies to manage the Windows operating system as well as code across functional verticals, according to the note. Wedbush said Microsoft expects 1.3 billion agents to be deployed by 2028. The Google I/O conference is crucial for the company amid concerns around the future of search in an AI-driven world, Wedbush said. The company has been actively innovating and closing the gap in the AI race through its Gemini AI services, the brokerage noted, adding that it expects Google to unveil new AI innovations coming to Google and Gemini for developers. ""We believe Gemini is help closing the gap vs. ChatGPT, and Google I/O is a key event to highlight AI innovations and technology coming to the Google developer world. We believe Google is heading into its innovation phase of AI, and the worries around search days in the rear view mirror are way overdone,"" Wedbush said in the note.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250520:A3382054:0/
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia and Broadcom",1747382280000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO.3 Reasons U.S. Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

FTC drops case over Microsoft's $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal,1747947638000,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission dropped a case that sought to block Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT $69 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard, saying on Thursday that pursuing the case against the long-closed deal was not in the public interest.FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson is seeking to use the agency's resources for cases that fit with President Donald Trump 's agenda, such as a probe related to whether advertisers colluded to spend less on X first reported by Reuters on Thursday. Ferguson is beginning to shut down some efforts started by his predecessor Lina Khan, including dropping a case on Thursday that had accused PepsiCo NASDAQ:PEP of price discrimination that favored Walmart NYSE:WMT .The FTC lost an appeal on May 7 seeking to reverse a judge's decision declining to block the Microsoft-Activision deal, which closed in 2023.Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Thursday that the FTC's decision to drop the case was ""a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C.""When challenging a new merger, the FTC typically asks a judge to temporarily block the deal to give the agency time to challenge it in its own administrative court. But deals that are temporarily blocked are often abandoned.Though the FTC lost its case seeking to block the deal temporarily, the agency could have sought to unwind the acquisition at a trial that was scheduled for July.The Activision Blizzard transaction marked the largest-ever acquisition in the video gaming market.

Group that opposed OpenAI's restructuring raises concerns about new revamp plan,1747344070000,"A group that opposed OpenAI's restructuring wrote in a letter this week that the startup's new organizational plan still does not go far enough to safeguard the ChatGPT creator from generating dangerous artificial intelligence technology.The letter dated May 12 was submitted to the California and Delaware attorneys-general by members of a group that calls itself Not For Private Gain. The letter said OpenAI's announcement this month to dial back some restructuring ""might be a step in the right direction,"" yet it does not adequately ensure that OpenAI sticks to its original mission to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The group of critics includes former OpenAI employees and AI experts such as Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist known as ""the Godfather of AI."" They objected to OpenAI's proposed reorganization because they said it would have put investors' profit motives ahead of public good. OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, who now is a competitor through his company xAI, also objected to the proposal on the same grounds, and is suing OpenAI for breaching the company’s founding contract. OpenAI dialed back its plan to restructure to remove control from its nonprofit parent entity in May after a firestorm of criticism that included that group's initial letter opposing the plan. OpenAI, in which Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT has invested more than $13 billion, now plans to convert its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC), with the nonprofit parent controlling the PBC and becoming a ""big shareholder"" in it. OpenAI says this will allow it to raise more capital to keep pace in the expensive AI race.A PBC is a structure designed to balance shareholder returns with social goals, unlike nonprofits, which are solely focused on public good.Monday's letter from opponents says the new plan still enables the company to put profits ahead of public good. First, OpenAI's current for-profit entity is required to advance its mission and charter above any investor interests, while the proposed PBC is not required to do so, it said.Second, OpenAI's nonprofit, as the sole manager, has 100% control over its for-profit entity today, granting it day-to-day operational power such as the ability to fire executives. In the proposed restructuring, the nonprofit would not have comprehensive control over the PBC, which the group said is concerning because the attorneys general derive their enforcement powers solely from the nonprofit's authority. OpenAI disagreed with the group's characterization, saying in a statement: ""The nonprofit would continue to have control over the PBC, full stop. Any suggestion otherwise is not accurate."" A lawyer for Elon Musk agreed with the letter, called OpenAI's new proposal ""nothing but window dressing.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RN0VA:0-group-that-opposed-openai-s-restructuring-raises-concerns-about-new-revamp-plan/"
Microsoft-backed OpenAI Enters Hardware Era In $6.5 Billion Deal,1747945516000,"OpenAI is venturing into hardware with its $6.5 billion acquisition of Sir Jony Ive's io, aiming to launch AI-powered companions by 202627 that blend unobtrusive design with real-world awareness.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities calls physical AI the next critical trend and sees the Ive partnership as a strategic play to marry leading AI models with Apple NASDAQ:AAPL -grade industrial design. Prototypes, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, pack cameras and microphones for environmental detection in a screen-less form factor roughly the size of an iPod Shufflewearable around the neck and leveraging connected PCs or smartphones for displays. Kuo's industry checks point to mass production in 2027, with assembly outside China to minimize geopolitical risk.The deal injects design heft into Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT - and SoftBank-backed OpenAI, which paid $5 billion in stock and expanded its existing 23% io stake valued at $1.5 billion. Altman and Ive emphasize stealth to prevent rivals from cloning their concept and reference Alan Kay's dictum that serious software players must craft their own hardware. This pivot follows Google's NASDAQ:GOOG I/O AI showcase and underscores OpenAI's bid to shift the narrative back in its favor.Why It Matters Investors should note that integrating cutting-edge AI with premium hardware could unlock higher margins and create stickier consumer offerings, elevating OpenAI's competitive moat against Big Tech's software-only strategy.Investors will look for prototype demos at year-end events and monitor official launch timing as the company refines specs ahead of a late-2026 debut.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:539777670094b:0-microsoft-backed-openai-enters-hardware-era-in-6-5-billion-deal/
"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Google to unveil AI upgrades at I/O conference amid search challenges,1747746000000,"Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google kicks off its annual developer conference on Tuesday with a flurry of announcements showcasing its huge investment in artificial intelligence, while seeking to fend off concerns over the future of its business.The I/O conference in Mountain View, California has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's long-time stronghold organizing and retrieving information on the internet.In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's ChatGPT.Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta NASDAQ:META .Now, with consumer usage of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking how aggressive Google is in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue.Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple NASDAQ:AAPL executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari web browser for the first time.In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics.A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years.The analysts pointed to a behavioral shift drawing consumers towards AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines.Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser.Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs.Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries.Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a ""universal AI agent.""At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time.The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat.Meanwhile, Google is growing other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by ""millions"" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR121:0-google-to-unveil-ai-upgrades-at-i-o-conference-amid-search-challenges/"

Market Chatter: Microsoft-backed Builder.ai's Former Executives Said to Have Reported 'Bogus' Sales,1747935934000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed Builder.ai collapsed followed an internal inquiry, which found that the company's former executives allegedly reported ""bogus"" sales to the board, The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing people close to the matter. The provisional accounts submitted by the technology startup to its auditor showed that the company revised its 2024 revenue estimates to about $55 million from a previously reported estimate of $220 million. It also reduced its previously reported 2023 total sales revenue of $180 million to about $45 million, the report said, citing the people. The prior revenue figures were submitted to the board when founder Sachin Dev Duggal was CEO, the report said. Duggal resigned as CEO along with Builder.ai's Chief Revenue Officer Varghese Cherian in early 2025, according to the report. The people familiar with the matter said that sales, which were previously booked, remained outstanding for an extended period of time due to Duggal's departure, raising concerns regarding revenue recognition. This eventually led to hiring of a law firm by the board to investigate the matter. The law firm shared its findings, which showed that there may have been a coordinated effort to inflate revenue at the company, the report said. Builder.ai said Tuesday it would enter insolvency proceedings and appoint an administrator to oversee the company's affairs. Builder.ai didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250522:A3383924:0/
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Moody's, Broadcom, Microsoft and CoreWeave",1747743960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Moody's MCO, Broadcom AVGO, Microsoft MSFT and CoreWeave CRWV.U.S. Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech BoomsIn poker, a ""tell"" is a player's subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, ""If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?""Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market's resilient reaction to the Moody's downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

OpenAI Update Offers 'Path Forward'-But With Gaps,1747340722000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed OpenAI's updated its plan to spin its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporationand it's a mixed bag. On May 5, the company said it would keep its nonprofit parent in the driver's seat, legally bound to consider the public good as it eyes an eventual IPO. In theory, that lets investors chase returns without steering the mission off course. But a watchdog group called Not For Private Gain isn't convinced: they've fired off a letter to the attorneys general in California and Delaware saying this tweak still leaves too many loopholes. Profits aren't capped, there's no guarantee that extra cash flows back to the nonprofit, and if the nonprofit board can't force the issue, neither can state regulators.Despite that pushback, OpenAI's board seems willing to listenactivists even praised them as open-minded for rolling out this version. Now the guardrails are on the table: capped payouts, ironclad profit-redistribution rules and clear, enforceable language that the charitable mission trumps everything else. The group has until May 29 to nail down stronger commitments, or they'll press the AGs to step in. Bottom line: how OpenAI squares investor incentives with its lofty mission could make or break its trust with researchers, regulators and future shareholdersand ultimately shape the path to its IPO.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:b8f9b6516094b:0-openai-update-offers-path-forward-but-with-gaps/
"Should You Buy, Hold or Sell OKTA Stock Before Q1 Earnings Release?",1747930320000,"Okta OKTA is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 27.For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, Okta anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of 76-77 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy? ",1747335600000,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze. Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIA Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corporation BAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA? Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corporation MSFT is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corporation ORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With this addition, Azure now offers more than 1,900 model variantsincluding from OpenAI, Meta, and DeepSeekwhile Google and Anthropic remain noticeably absent. The inclusion of Grok follows a recent controversy where the model, embedded in Musk's social platform X, surfaced misleading contenta misstep xAI attributed to an unauthorized modification. Despite this, Microsoft is pressing ahead, offering developers more model optionality at a time when enterprise demand for flexibility is rising.At its annual Build developer conference, Microsoft showcased several updates aimed at strengthening its AI infrastructure. Among them: new tools to help businesses manage AI agentssoftware designed to act on a user's behalf. Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott emphasized that for agents to be useful, they need to talk to everything in the world. The company is also joining the steering committee for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, a technical standard that governs how AI systems interactdespite Anthropic's own models still being unavailable on Azure. Microsoft is clearly positioning itself not just as a cloud vendor, but as the connective tissue for AI innovation across the industry.The company's AI business is gaining traction fast. Microsoft previously guided to at least $13 billion in annualized revenue across its AI offerings, which include both infrastructure and application layers. At Build, it introduced a model leaderboard, a tool to recommend the best model for a given task, and new systems to help enterprises train AI using their proprietary data. The addition of Grok brings a high-profileif somewhat controversialplayer into Microsoft's expanding ecosystem.

"US Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech Booms",1747682700000,"US Stocks Brush Aside Moody’s DowngradeIn poker, a “tell” is a player’s subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody’s ( MCO ) credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, “If bad news can’t bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?”Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics Present BeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.Image Source: BeSpoke Investment Group The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom ( AVGO ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there’s anything baseball’s steroid era taught, it’s that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China. Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950 S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Image Source: Carson Investment ResearchBottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market’s resilient reaction to the Moody’s downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:bf8993135094b:0-us-stocks-brush-off-moody-s-echo-past-tech-booms/

"Microsoft Stock Remains a Buy, Analysts Say. Why They Think Shares Can Rise 20%. — Barrons.com",1747331460000,"By Nate WolfAfter a year of lagging behind its Magnificent Seven peers, Microsoft stock has plenty of room to rise in the year ahead, Wall Street analysts say.On Thursday, analysts at both Citi and Evercore issued positive outlooks for Microsoft, citing the strength of the tech giant's Azure cloud-computing arm, the payoff from its enterprise artificial-intelligence investments, and the cost savings of recent job cuts.Citi, which has a Buy rating on the stock, lifted its target price to $540 from $480 — a roughly 20% increase from Wednesday's close of $450.44. Evercore maintained its $500 price target and Outperform rating ahead of the investment bank's Microsoft 360 Day event on May 20.The stamps of approval from Wall Street are welcome news for Microsoft as it battles to keep pace with other megacap tech stocks.Over the past year, the company's 12-month price-to-earnings ratio has gained just 7%, compared with 29% for Roundhill's Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, according to data from FactSet.Trimming costs could help. Microsoft said Tuesday it will reduce its workforce by around 3%, equaling several thousand employees. A company spokesperson told Barron's the cuts would ""best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.""Citi analysts see the layoffs as a positive, estimating they could save Microsoft roughly 4%, or $2.5 billion a year, in operating expenses.Meanwhile, the days of massive capital spending growth associated with AI infrastructure might finally be over, Evercore's analysts noted. They predict year-over-year capital expenditure growth has likely peaked. All that past investment now has the potential to pay off down the road.""While the cost burden related to new AI infrastructure is being felt today, the revenue associated with these investments will be recognized for years to come,"" the Evercore analysts wrote.The AI boom could be particularly helpful for Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business, which had seen growth fluctuate in past quarters.At the start of the month, Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, buoyed by 33% year-over-year growth for Azure. And both groups of analysts now estimate Azure revenue will grow more than 30% through the company's next fiscal year.With growth in its core business areas stabilizing and expenses under control after a surge in AI investment, Microsoft could be in line for a strong finish to the calendar year.The tech giant is already off to a solid start.

Microsoft Sues To Curb Lumma Stealer Threat,1747924465000,"On Wednesday, Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Digital Crimes Unit brought suit on May 13 against Lumma Stealer, an information-stealing malware used by hundreds of threat actors to siphon passwords, credit-card data, bank details and cryptocurrency wallets.Between March 16 and May 16, Microsoft detected over 394,000 Windows PCs infected with Luma Stealer, according to assistant general counsel Steven Masada in a company blog post. Leveraging a U.S. court order, the DCU seized or took down roughly 2,300 malicious domains forming Lumma's command-and-control backbone. Simultaneously, the Department of Justice disrupted the malware's central servers and online marketplaces, while Europol's EC3 and Japan's JC3 suspended locally based infrastructure nodesmarking one of the most extensive multinational takedowns of an info-stealer to date.The growth and resilience of Lumma Stealer highlights the broader evolution of cybercrime and underscores the need for layered defenses and industry collaboration to counter threats, Microsoft said in a separate post. Analysts note this legal offensive follows earlier DCU actions against other high-profile info-stealers and could pressure peers such as CrowdStrike NASDAQ:CRWD and Palo Alto Networks NASDAQ:PANW to accelerate feature rollouts. Compared with a similar takedown of TrickBot in October 2024, which involved 1,100 domains and an estimated 150,000 infections, this operation more than doubles the scale of disruption.Why It Matters This aggressive move not only hampers Lumma's infrastructure but also underscores Microsoft's growing role as both defender and regulator, signaling to investors its commitment to bolstering enterprise-security offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e4eb38b37094b:0-microsoft-sues-to-curb-lumma-stealer-threat/

CoreWeave Scores a Google Win and More Business from OpenAI — Barrons.com,1747321740000,"By Tae KimCoreWeave shares were wavering in early trading Thursday after the AI cloud firm reported better-than-expected revenue for its initial quarter as a public company.While stocks often react to short-term news in the wake of quarterly results, CoreWeave offered some long-term good news for investors: it's starting to win significant business from major technology companies beyond its largest customer Microsoft.Late Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter with a loss of $1.49 per share. Revenue came in at $981.6 million, up 420% year-over-year, which was above analysts' expectations for $857 million.CoreWeave said it expects revenue in the current quarter to range from $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion versus the $988 million consensus. For the full year, the company expects revenue to range from $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, compared with the $4.66 billion estimate. The company also guided its 2025 capex to a range of $20 billion to $23 billion, which was higher than analysts' $19.3 billion estimate, according to FactSet.CoreWeave stock has wavered from positive to negative territory in the wake of the earnings report. Shares are currently up 0.7% in late-morning trading on Thursday.The stock is volatile on a day-to-day basis and had rallied 6.6% on Wednesday heading into the earnings report.""Demand for our platform is robust and accelerating as AI leaders seek the highly performant AI cloud infrastructure required for the most advanced applications,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in a press release. ""We are scaling as fast as possible to capture that demand.""In an interview with Barron's after the earnings call, Intrator said he is optimistic about the future prospects of a new hyperscaler customer that was signed in the first quarter. While he wouldn't name the new customer, the CoreWeave website now shows Google as a customer, which hasn't been disclosed in the past. Intrator also said that the faster Nvidia innovates on new GPUs, the better it is for CoreWeave as they are better equipped to quickly bring the new technology to customers.In the company's 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, CoreWeave also revealed it has entered into an agreement for additional services worth up to $4 billion through April 2029 with OpenAI.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated his Buy Rating on CoreWeave, citing the company's strong revenue outlook and customer wins. The ""top AI players keep knocking on CRWV's door,"" he wrote. ""We see no sign of AI compute tailwinds easing up soon & see CRWV as a multi-yr winner.""Not everyone was positive about CoreWeave's first quarter. Skeptics pointed to the high level of interest and depreciation expenses that made up 72% of revenue in the quarter, reflecting CoreWeave's high risk business model that uses large amounts of debt and capital expenditures. Backlog also edged down sequentially and Microsoft still constituted the vast majority of CoreWeave's revenue at 72%, reflecting customer concentration risk.On Thursday DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded CoreWeave to Underperform from Neutral, citing the high level of capital expenditures needed to sustain the business. He wrote that the results ""confirm our concern that CoreWeave is not a business worth scaling.""It has been a wild ride for CoreWeave since the company priced its initial public offering at $40 in late March. The pricing came in below the initial expected range, but the stock has since rallied more than 50% from its offer price as large technology companies gave robust guidance for their 2025 capex spending during earnings season.CoreWeave was founded in 2017 and provides large-scale access to graphics processing units, or GPUs, via the cloud. With physical GPUs expensive and in hot demand, it has become a much needed service for both start-ups and more mature enterprises. CoreWeave also has a close partnership with Nvidia, which invested in the start-up when it was private and as part of the IPO.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Microsoft to offer rival AI models from own data center; launches AI coding agent,1747670414000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT said on Monday it would offer new AI models made by Elon Musk 's xAI, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META and European startups Mistral and Black Forest Labs hosted in its own data centers, and unveiled a new artificial-intelligence tool designed to complete software coding tasks on its own.The announcements, made at Microsoft's annual Build software developer conference in Seattle, Washington, underscored the changing nature of Microsoft's relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Microsoft has backed and which announced a directly competing product last week.Microsoft has recently situated itself as a more neutral player in the AI arms race, showing less appetite to shell out huge sums of cash to fund OpenAI's research ambitions while also working with a broader array of AI players, all with an eye on expanding sales while keeping a lid on costs.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the new offerings from xAI, Meta and others will be provided with the same reliability guarantees that come with OpenAI models hosted by Microsoft.""That's just a game-changer in terms of how you think about models and model provisioning,"" Nadella told conference attendees during a keynote address. ""It's exciting for us as developers to be able to mix and match and use them all.""Microsoft's new GitHub Copilot feature is what is known as a coding agent, an AI tool designed to help developers with coding tasks. While previous iterations of Microsoft's AI coding tools could automatically generate bits of code based on what a developer was already doing, the agent is designed to go much further.The agent will take a few instructions from a human - such as a description of a software bug and a strategy for how to fix it - and then get to work, alerting the human to review its work once it has finished coding.OpenAI last week released a preview of a similar agent that it calls Codex.At the Build conference on Monday, Microsoft laid out a vision of a world in which businesses will craft agents of their own for various tasks inside a business. Its primary offering in that area is called Azure Foundry - a service that lets businesses build their own agents based on the AI model of their choice.Those agents are likely to be built with a mix of different AI models, Asha Sharma, corporate vice president for product of Microsoft AI platforms, told Reuters.Microsoft on Monday said it would offer xAI's Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models on its cloud services as well as Meta's Llama models and offerings from French startup Mistral and German startup Black Forest Labs, bringing the total number of models it offers to Azure customers to more than 1,900.Significantly, those models will run within Microsoft's own data centers, meaning Microsoft can make promises about their availability in an era when popular models are often plagued by outages when demand outstrips the capacity to serve them. Sharma said Microsoft plans to add more popular models soon.""One of the most important parts to be able to build an app and seamlessly use the most popular models is making sure your reserved capacity that you have with Azure OpenAI starts to work across the most popular models,"" Sharma said.Microsoft also said on Monday that it was creating a way for AI agents to have the same kind of digital identifier as human employees inside a company's systems.""The concept of treating agents as digital employees is the kind of groundbreaking change that will both open some impressive new capabilities but also raise concerns about the impact that AI is going to make in the workplace,"" said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR0U5:0-microsoft-to-offer-rival-ai-models-from-own-data-center-launches-ai-coding-agent/"

Microsoft and OpenAI Just Hit Reset—Here’s Why MSFT Stock Wins,1747319400000,"Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT and OpenAI have announced that they are looking to  reset their partnership . The reset is the latest chapter in a story that’s been building between the two companies for the last six years. In this case, it should be profitable for MSFT stock . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI started in 2019 with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft. Over the next several years, that investment grew to over  $13 billion , giving Microsoft access to OpenAI’s  ChatGPT generative AI program . In that time, Microsoft built its network of AI agents (i.e., Copilots) that ran on top of ChatGPT.This relationship vaulted Microsoft to the forefront of the AI race, and shareholders were the beneficiaries. MSFT stock has delivered a  total return of over 140% in the last five years.However, since 2023, the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has become more strained, starting with OpenAI’s decision to fire Sam Altman in December 2022 . At that point, the company’s partnership was yielding positive benefits for both sides . But it also crystallized the idea that the partnership would have to evolve or end.Breaking Up Is Hard to DoIn January 2025, OpenAI and Microsoft seemed to be heading for a messy breakup . At that time, Microsoft confirmed that it was no longer going to be OpenAI’s sole cloud provider . However, OpenAI was making a “ new, large commitment ” to Microsoft’s AI cloud computing platform, Azure .OpenAI was planning to place its business under the control of a for-profit business . That plan has now been abandoned. However, the company’s goals of being a public company haven’t ended, and it will now be financed by none other than Microsoft .That’s right. While the terms of the new funding aren’t completely clear, it appears that OpenAI will be using some of the $13 billion from Microsoft to fund an initial public offering (IPO) . But the plot thickens. Microsoft is expected to have an undefined level of equity in OpenAI’s new business. However, reports are saying that Microsoft may be willing to reduce its equity stake if OpenAI allows Microsoft to have access to new technology developed by OpenAI after the 2030 cutoff .This would be a key concession from OpenAI and it would be yet another reason for long-term investors to be bullish on MSFT stock . [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:MSFT] The OpenAI News Allows MSFT Shareholders to Focus on the Bigger PictureMicrosoft stock is up about 3% in a week when the bulls returned to Wall Street. That’s far below the returns of other technology stocks like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ:NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ:AAPL that have gained 15% and 7% , respectively.However, Microsoft had less to catch up on. Over the last month, MSFT stock is up 18.9% . This cements the notion that Microsoft is a tariff-proof stock . The company will have some exposure to tariffs with its Xbox system . But overall, the company’s software products are immune to tariff concerns .That said, the company has trimmed  its workforce by 3% in the last week. Those cuts, which included many management positions, aren’t being made because of AI efficiencies. Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of what it perceives as a weaker environment for consumer spending on items like video game consoles and personal computers.At 36x earnings , MSFT stock is trading at a slight premium to its historical averages and near the top of its 52-week range. Those are two reasons MSFT stock hasn’t climbed even after delivering stellar earnings. However, the Microsoft and OpenAI reset is another reason investors are bullish on MSFT stock .Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:df1494a59094b:0-microsoft-and-openai-just-hit-reset-here-s-why-msft-stock-wins/
Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down 20% Before Earnings for AI Growth?,1747915200000,"Salesforce ( CRM )  stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM’s slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28. The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service. CRM’s growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce’s offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce’s transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft (MSFT) and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM’s Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce’s new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program “agents” for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development. Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said “nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,” and all of its “top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.”The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, “achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation.” The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce’s AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company’s EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT’s 1,700% and Tech’s 720%. Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector’s 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft’s 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech’s 115% and Microsoft’s 150%. CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech’s 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM’s PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:faad8e6f8094b:0-buy-this-megacap-tech-stock-down-20-before-earnings-for-ai-growth/

With businesses globally undergoing digital overhauls, Salesforce's commitment to aligning its product offerings with customer needs is likely to have boosted its revenues for the quarter.The growing demand for generative AI-enabled cloud solutions has been a major catalyst for Salesforce. By embedding generative AI tools across its products, the company not only enhances customer engagement but also strengthens its competitive position in the customer relationship management space. This forward-thinking approach might have significantly contributed to its top-line growth during the to-be-reported quarter.Salesforce’s ability to deepen relationships with leading brands across industries and expand its reach in key geographic markets remains a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company’s increasing footprint in the public sector is likely to have provided a further boost, unlocking new growth opportunities during the first quarter.The acquisitions of Spiff, Own and Zoomin have been pivotal in enhancing Salesforce's capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. These additions are likely to have driven higher subscription revenues, particularly across its core cloud services. Salesforce’s key cloud offerings, including Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data, are expected to have delivered robust growth.Our first-quarter revenue estimates for Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data cloud services are pegged at $2.14 billion, $2.34 billion, $1.84 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. We expect revenues of approximately $9.21 billion and $518.8 million for the Subscription and Support segment and the Professional Services division, respectively.The ongoing cost restructuring initiative is likely to have boosted Salesforce’s profitability in the first quarter. The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 33.1%, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of cost restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.CRM’s Price Performance & ValuationOver the past year, Salesforce shares have risen 1.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry’s growth of 10.4%. Compared to its peers, CRM stock has also underperformed other enterprise software makers, including SAP SE SAP, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT. Over the past year, shares of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have gained 53.1%, 26.7% and 6%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value Salesforce offers investors at the current levels. CRM stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.48X compared with the industry’s 9.25X.CRM stock also trades at a discounted multiple compared with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/S multiples of 8.38X, 6.77X and 10.87X, respectively.Investment Thesis for Salesforce StockSalesforce is the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management industry, consistently outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Gartner’s annual rankings reaffirm its top position year after year. Its ability to maintain this dominance stems from its expansive product suite, seamless integrations and innovative approach to enterprise solutions.Strategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in strengthening its market position. The $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack in 2021 significantly enhanced its collaboration capabilities, making Salesforce a comprehensive enterprise software provider. More recently, the $1.9-billion acquisition of Own Company in 2024 bolstered its data protection and AI capabilities, a move that aligns with growing enterprise priorities around security and automation.Salesforce’s AI initiatives further cement its leadership. Since introducing Einstein GPT in March 2023, the company has expanded its AI-driven functionalities across its entire ecosystem. This technology enhances automation, streamlines workflows and improves customer interactions, giving Salesforce a significant advantage as AI adoption accelerates across industries.Additionally, Salesforce is positioned to benefit from the continued rise in worldwide IT spending. Gartner projects global IT spending to reach $5.61 trillion in 2025, implying a 9.8% year-over-year increase.

"Stock Market News for May 22, 2025",1747909440000,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday following spike in yields of long-dated U.S. sovereign bonds. Market participants remained concerned that the proposed tax-cut bill of President Trump will further worsen U.S. fiscal deficit. The U.S.-China tariff war also remained unresolved. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 1.9% or 816.80 points to close at 41,860.44. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and one finished in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 18,872.64, sliding 1.4% due to weak performance of technology bigwigs. Technology giants like Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL fell 1.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Both stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

All 11 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in negative territory. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) decreased 2%, 2.1%, 2.3% and 2.7%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 15.4% to 20.87. A total of 19.39 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 17.34 billion. The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities. As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February. Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:747eff640094b:0-stock-market-news-for-may-22-2025/
3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a0f366036094b:0-should-you-stay-invested-in-or-sell-coreweave-stock-post-q1-earnings/

Microsoft hosts developer conference as focus grows on AI profits,1747648800000,"Microsoft hosts its annual software developer conference in Seattle on Monday, drawing thousands of coders looking to turn the past years of investments into artificial intelligence into profitable products and services for consumers and businesses.The Redmond, Washington-based software giant, which is an investor and deep strategic partner with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and has already spent $64 billion this year, much of it on data centers needed for AI-based services such as Copilot used in its popular Microsoft 365 applications.But there are signs that Microsoft — whose shares are up more than 30% this year, defying a broader Nasdaq decline — is reworking its relationship with OpenAI and seeking to become a neutral arms dealer in the AI race.Earlier this year, Microsoft allowed OpenAI to branch out and work with Oracle on the massive ""Stargate"" data center project in Texas.Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella has argued the company can get expenses down, saying that once it settles on an algorithm and begins to optimize it, Microsoft can obtain 10 times better performance for the same computing costs.Demand for AI services in Microsoft's Azure cloud computing is also continuing to grow.Thomas Blakey, an equity analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said that the company is increasingly keeping revenue-generating AI services inside its own data centers, where it can continue to tweak them for better cost.

The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its  market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a “clear and complete resolution” to its rivals’ concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft’s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it’s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it’s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That’s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it’s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it’s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft’s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft’s productivity applications.That’s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a “walled garden” effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company’s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock’s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock’s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average. Also, Microsoft’s estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11.35% is below its three-year average of 15.9%. From a technical standpoint, the move lower on May 21 dropped the stock below its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages, which may be a sign that a reversal is in place.While short-term volatility exists, Microsoft's strong fundamentals and market position suggest a favorable outlook for investors. Analysts continue to bid the stock higher. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give MSFT stock a Moderate Buy rating with a $512.63 price target that marks a 13% upside from its price on May 21.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:59be14231094b:0-microsoft-could-rally-as-eu-antitrust-case-nears-resolution/

Microsoft wants AI 'agents' to work together and remember things,1747615626000,"Microsoft envisions a future where any company's artificial intelligence agents can work together with agents from other firms and have better memories of their interactions, its chief technologist said on Sunday ahead of the company's annual software developer conference.Microsoft is holding its Build conference in Seattle on May 19, where analysts expect the company to unveil its latest tools for developers building AI systems.Speaking at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, ahead of the conference, Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott told reporters and analysts the company is focused on helping spur the adoption of standards across the technology industry that will let agents from different makers collaborate. Agents are AI systems that can accomplish specific tasks, such as fixing a software bug, on their own.Scott said that Microsoft is backing a technology called Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source protocol introduced by Google-backed Anthropic. Scott said MCP has the potential to create an ""agentic web"" similar to the way hypertext protocols that helped spread the internet in the 1990s.""It means that your imagination gets to drive what the agentic web becomes, not just a handful of companies that happen to see some of these problems first,"" Scott said.Scott also said that Microsoft is trying to help AI agents have better memories of things that users have asked them to do, noting that, so far, ""most of what we're building feels very transactional.""But making an AI agent's memory better costs a lot of money because it requires more computing power. Microsoft is focusing on a new approach called structured retrieval augmentation, where an agent extracts short bits of each turn in a conversation with a user, creating a roadmap to what was discussed.""This is a core part of how you train a biological brain - you don't brute force everything in your head every time you need to solve a particular problem,"" Scott said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RQ06N:0-microsoft-wants-ai-agents-to-work-together-and-remember-things/"

Nvidia's Huang set to showcase latest AI tech at Taiwan's Computex,1747609200000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA chief executive Jensen Huang is set to open the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Monday, where he is expected to discuss the company's advancements in artificial intelligence server systems, cloud computing products and robotics.Huang's 90-minute presentation will start at 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) at the Taipei Music Hall.Once primarily focused on the PC industry, the Santa Clara, California-based company has used its presence at Computex to launch new graphics cards for video games. Earlier this year, Nvidia unveiled a new line of graphics chips at the CES show in Las Vegas.But Nvidia has grown beyond its roots as a video game graphics chip maker into the dominant producer of chips that have powered the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry since ChatGPT's launch in 2022.Nvidia has been designing central processing units (CPUs) that would run Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Windows operating system and use technology from Arm Holdings NASDAQ:ARM , Reuters has previously reported.At Computex last year, Huang sparked ""Jensanity"" in Taiwan, as the public and media breathlessly followed the CEO, who was mobbed by attendees at the trade show. During the company's annual developer conference in March, Huang outlined how Nvidia would position itself to address the shift in computing needs from building large AI models to running applications based on them.In a more than two-hour speech, Huang unveiled several new generations of AI chips, including the Blackwell Ultra, which will be available later this year.The company's Rubin chips will be followed by Feynman processors, which are set to arrive in 2028.Nvidia also launched a desktop version of its AI chips, called DGX Spark, targeting AI researchers.Computex, which will run from May 20 to 23, is expected to have 1,400 exhibitors.

Google Has Made Progress in AI. Its Challenge Is Making Products. — Barrons.com,1747848660000,"By Adam LevineThis article is from the free weekly Barron's Tech email newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox.Burying the Lead. At Google I/O, the search giant's annual developers conference, Alphabet-unit Google unveiled its answer to new AI search engines like Perplexity and ChatGPT, which are nipping at its heels. But Google Search's new ""AI Mode"" was buried beneath a blizzard of other announcements, some more important than others.Let's sort through it.Grinding Its Way to AI Relevance. Despite a decade of heavy investment into AI, Google wound up racing from behind when OpenAI's ChatGPT leapfrogged it in November 2022. While we still await some of the most advanced products that were announced at I/O, Google's underlying AI technology seems to be catching up through heavy investment and rapid iteration.Handicapped. AI Mode is an important step in Google's battle to stave off new competition from AI search engines. It pairs the benefits of AI with the power of Google Search's unparalleled web index. But the implementation shows how the search giant is handicapped in this battle.Accessing AI Mode requires an extra click, which will likely reduce usage. In designing the new interface element, Google had to be careful not to break the search experience that users know so well — type and hit return. Perplexity and ChatGPT don't have a legacy interface to serve, and they can make the AI search experience more natural.Making AI Is Hard, but It's Easier Than Making Products. AI announcements at I/O included AI Mode, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini Live, Gemini in Chrome, Veo 3, Imagen 4, Flow, Beam, Canvas, Agent Mode, and that doesn't include experimental products like Project Aura and Project Astra.Without looking it up, can anyone tell me what all these things do, and why I should use them? The product branding feels removed from the use case, potentially leading to customer confusion.This gets back to Google's longtime problem with turning tech into products. As tracked by the website KilledByGoogle.com, Google has shut down 296 products over the years. It has had 13 messaging apps, four of which are still going.Google's challenge is bringing all these strands together in a way that makes a simple pitch to users, the same way Search did in 1997.Making Agents Happen. One loud-and-clear message from both Google I/O and Microsoft's Monday Build conference is that AI ""agents"" are where these companies see the future. Agents are apps that work on top of an AI language model, automating a series of tasks from simple commands. Microsoft is pitching them to its business customers, while Google unveiled Agent Mode for consumer use.For Google, it's vital to maintain control of these AI personal assistants. Once let loose in a browser, these agents can go everywhere a human goes, including searching on Google. The issue is AI agents don't care about Google's advertising. At some point in the not-too-distant future, a large portion of web traffic may be AI agents. All ad-supported services, including Google Search, should find that troubling.But if Google is the one providing the agents, it can monetize them, making up for the loss of human traffic on the web.This Week in Barron's Tech- Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals.

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

IonQ Stock Jumps 21% Following Q1 Earnings Results: Still a Buy?,1747847700000,"IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company’s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share’s Price Performance Post Q1 Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ’s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ’s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ’s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions — Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq’s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella’s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ’s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts’ optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%. Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ’s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ’s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors. Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ’s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company’s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ’s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption. The recent 21% increase in share price following first-quarter 2025 earnings is more than just momentum; it reflects meaningful strategic progress.The $22-million commercial deal with EPB, expanding government partnerships like DARPA’s benchmarking initiative, and acquisitions that bolster capabilities in quantum internet infrastructure all underscore IonQ’s leadership in a rapidly evolving space.Despite high R&D expenses and integration risks, IonQ’s nearly $700 million cash position provides the financial flexibility to pursue innovation aggressively without compromising its long-term vision. While the stock’s valuation is lofty, the narrowing consensus loss estimates and reaffirmed guidance signal growing confidence in execution.For long-term investors willing to embrace volatility, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a company building the foundation of next-generation computing and secure communications.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:440e7a061094b:0-ionq-stock-jumps-21-following-q1-earnings-results-still-a-buy/

Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/

"David Tepper's Appaloosa Sells FedEx Stock, Alters Mag 7 Holdings — Barrons.com",1747426800000,"Al RootHedge funds are filing their required quarterly portfolio disclosures, a focus for investors who want to know what the "" smart money"" is doing.Appaloosa Management qualifies as smart money. It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%. Appaloosa might have taken profits in the latter and not see a turnaround coming for the former. Or it may have liked other opportunities better.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

OpenAI's $3 Billion Power Play Could Upend the Future of Coding,1747422130000,"OpenAI is making a serious play for the future of software development. The company just launched Codex, a new AI agent built to write features, squash bugs, and run testsall within ChatGPT. Available first to paying users on Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans, Codex is powered by a customized version of OpenAI's o3 model, fine-tuned for engineering tasks. It's still early days, and the tool isn't fully autonomous yetbut OpenAI staff are already using it daily, and external testers like Cisco and Kodiak Robotics have jumped in to explore use cases ranging from automation to prototyping.The bigger story? OpenAI could be preparing to buy Windsurf, a fast-growing startup in the AI coding space, for about $3 billionpotentially the company's largest acquisition to date. That would put OpenAI in direct competition with Google NASDAQ:GOOG , Anthropic, and Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed GitHub, all of which are racing to build the best AI copilots for developers. Startups like Cursor-maker Anysphere are also drawing investor interest with tools that suggest code based on a developer's intent, and Windsurf sits right in the middle of that action. If the deal goes through, OpenAI wouldn't just be scaling Codexit could be buying its way into developer mindshare.Under the hood, Codex is being framed as a stepping stone toward full-blown AI agentssystems that can handle complex workflows with minimal human direction. Depending on the task, Codex might take anywhere from a minute to half an hour to complete a job, and OpenAI says it's seeing rapid improvement in the model's reasoning capabilities. Importantly, Codex was also trained to flag and reject malicious requests, addressing concerns around AI-generated malware. For now, OpenAI seems to be testing both the product and the market. But with billions on the table and demand growing fast, this could be a critical chapter in the arms race to own the future of AI-powered development.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:0b31af19e094b:0-openai-s-3-billion-power-play-could-upend-the-future-of-coding/

Adobe Jumps 19% in a Month: Is There Any Momentum Left in the Stock?,1747843860000,"Adobe ADBE shares have jumped 19% in a month, reflecting its deepening Generative AI (Gen AI) focus and innovative Gen AI-powered portfolio. A pause in tariffs that reduced macroeconomic uncertainty also helped the stock. However, Adobe’s near-term prospects remain challenging given stiff competition in the AI and GenAI space from the likes of Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI, as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions. Adobe’s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Gen AI solutions.Stiff competition has negatively impacted Adobe shares, which have underperformed peers like Microsoft and document services & e-signature provider DocuSign DOCU over the past month, but outperformed Alphabet. Microsoft, DocuSign and Alphabet shares returned 24.9%, 20.9% and 8.2%, respectively, over the same timeframe. The challenging near-term prospect is expected to remain an overhang on the Adobe shares.ADBE Stock’s PerformanceAdobe shares are also overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of D. ADBE stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.28X compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.14X, Salesforce’s 6.61X, DocuSign’s 5.69X and Alphabet’s 5.90X.Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)So, what should investors do with Adobe shares right now? Let’s dig deep to find out.Can Adobe’s Innovative Portfolio Boost Prospects?Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns. Adobe launched Firefly Video Model-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, which leverages AI to instantly generate and expand the length of video and audio clips. Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe’s prospects. ADBE is infusing Gen AI innovations across its portfolio, including AI-first standalone and add-on products such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly App and Services, and GenStudio for Performance Marketing. These factors are expected to boost top-line growth.Adobe Offers Positive Guidance for FY25Adobe’s new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter). ADBE expects this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.For fiscal 2025, Digital Media Annual Recurring Revenue is now expected to grow roughly 11%. Digital Media segment revenues are expected to be between $17.25 billion and $17.40 billion. Digital Experience segment revenues are expected between $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, while Digital Experience subscription segment revenues are expected between $5.375 billion and $5.425 billion.Adobe reaffirmed its total revenue guidance, which is expected between $23.30 billion and $23.55 billion ($21.51 billion in fiscal 2024).

What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?,1747413720000,"Income-hungry investors have been piling into ETFs that use options to deliver juicy dividends. We've seen a surge in launches of these products recently, as providers employ innovative strategies to package derivatives within the ETF structure to meet rising investor demand.In addition to offering high yields, these strategies generally help reduce portfolio volatility. However, investors should remember that there’s no free lunch in investing. These products tend to perform best in sideways markets and often underperform during strong bull runs. That said, they can provide some downside protection when stocks fall.Quantitative Researcher Roni Israelov refers to these strategies as a “Devil’s Bargain.” His research shows that trading options to generate income can undermine long-term investment returns.This paper is Roni’s personal research and not a work product of Citadel.Our own analysis of the most popular derivatives-backed ETFs also suggests that investors may be leaving significant returns on the table in their pursuit of high income. Nevertheless, these products have attracted substantial inflows this year, as market volatility has shaken investor confidence.The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses proprietary research to select around 130 stocks and writes S&P 500 Index call options to generate income. Its top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META.JEPI and its sister fund, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, are among the top asset gatherers this year.The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO aims to deliver high income from both dividends and covered calls. Its managers focus on high-quality large-cap companies with a history of dividend growth and write covered calls on individual stocks.While DIVO has outperformed JEPI, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term on a total return basis.JEPQ and the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD continue to underperform the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d14073830094b:0-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-options-income-etfs/
Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold INOD Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747411920000,"Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company’s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata’s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues — highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company’s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% — demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology — each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management’s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD’s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts’ bearish sentiments about the stock.

This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company’s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere’s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata. With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit. While long-term prospects look strong amid rising AI spending from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, near-term risks tied to customer concentration, execution and margin pressure remain.Given the southward revision of earnings estimates and the current valuation suggesting caution for new entrants, existing shareholders should consider holding, and new investors may wait for further validation of revenue diversification and pipeline conversion before adding to positions.INOD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/
Market Chatter: Crusoe Receives $11.6 Billion in Funding for OpenAI Data Center in Texas,1747825916000,"Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's partner Crusoe has received $11.6 billion in new funding commitments for a data center in Abilene, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The funding, which will come from a mixture of debt and equity provided by Blue Owl Capital (OWL) and Crusoe, will expand the data center to eight buildings from its previously planned two, each equipped with up to 50,000 Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA Blackwell chips, the report said. Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle NYSE:ORCL agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI agreed to rent servers from Oracle while Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips, according to the report. OpenAI, Blue Owl, Crusoe, and Oracle did not immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250521:A3382614:0/
Microsoft Makes Fresh Bid to End EU Antitrust Probe Over Teams — 2nd Update,1747411800000,"By Edith HancockMicrosoft made concessions to avert a potentially heavy fine from European Union officials who are probing how the tech giant offers its Teams platform to customers in the bloc.Officials from the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, are now seeking feedback on Microsoft's concessions, the antitrust body said Friday. Microsoft offered to make its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites available without Teams at a reduced rate and allow existing customers to switch to using those suites without Teams.The company also pledged to offer platforms that compete with Teams better interoperability with Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to facilitate using competing products.Microsoft also said that if the commitments become binding, it will align its worldwide suites offers and pricing with its EU plans, the commission said. The regulator is now asking for feedback from rivals and customers on those commitments.If regulators ultimately accept Microsoft's offer, it would end a long-running probe into the tech giant's packaging of Teams--which provides video calls and other kinds of office collaboration tools--with its office products sparked by a complaint from rival Slack in 2020.It accused Microsoft of bundling Teams with its office suites, giving it an unfair advantage over other platforms. German software group Alfaview also complained to the EU regulator.The tech giant had previously tried to appease the commission, offering to split off Teams from its suites in Europe in 2023 and then extending that offer globally, but officials said earlier adjustments were insufficient to ease their concerns and sent a formal statement of objections to the company in June last year.Nanna-Louise Linde, Microsoft's vice president of European government affairs, said in a blog post on Friday that the commitments ""represent a clear and complete resolution to the concerns raised by our competitors and will provide European customers with more choices.""Sabastian Niles, president and chief legal officer of Slack owner Salesforce, said that the company would carefully scrutinize Microsoft's offer.Write to Edith Hancock at edith.hancock@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250516005454:0-microsoft-makes-fresh-bid-to-end-eu-antitrust-probe-over-teams-2nd-update/
Buy the Spike in Intuit (INTU) Stock After Earnings?,1748044980000,"Spiking +8% today, Intuit INTU stock made headlines after comfortably exceeding expectations for its fiscal third quarter after-market hours on Thursday.Sitting on gains of +15% year to date, Intuit stock has outperformed the broader market and many of its notable Zacks Computer-Software peers, including Microsoft MSFT and Salesforce CRM.Not too far from its 52-week high of $734 a share, investors are surely wondering if there is more upside in store for the financial software giant’s stock, with generative AI starting to enhance Intuit’s accounting and tax preparation services. Intuit’s Q3 Results Thanks to its AI-driven solutions, Intuit’s Q3 sales of $7.75 billion eclipsed estimates of $7.54 billion and spiked from $6.73 billion a year ago. CEO Sasan Goodarzi stated Intuit is becoming a one-stop shop for AI agents and AI-enabled human experts. Notably, Intuit Assist offers a generative AI-powered financial assistant that helps users with tax filing, business insights, and financial decision-making. On the bottom line, Intuit's Q3 EPS of $11.65 rose 18% from $9.88 in the comparative quarter and topped expectations of $10.89 per share by nearly 7%. More intriguing, Intuit has now surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 13 consecutive quarters with an average earnings surprise of 12.15% in its last four quarterly reports. Intuit's Revenue Guidance Serving as a further catalyst to Friday’s rally was that Intuit raised its full-year revenue guidance and now expects fiscal 2025 sales to be between $18.72 billion-18.76 billion, up from previous estimates of $18.16 billion-$18.35 billion. This came in above Zacks' estimates of $18.28 billion or 12% growth (Current Year below). Zacks' projections currently call for Intuit’s total sales to increase another 12% in FY26 to $20.48 billion.Monitoring Intuit’s P/E Valuation Following its post-earnings rally, Intuit stock is trading at a 34.5X forward earnings multiple, which is on par with Microsoft but a premium to its industry average of 27.3X, with Salesforce at 25.5X. However, INTU does trade well below its decade-long high of 87.2X forward earnings and offers a 23% discount to its median of 44.9X during this period. Bottom LineFor now, Intuit stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q3 report. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way as earnings estimate revisions could trend higher in the coming weeks, considering Intuit’s elevated revenue guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2309070b7094b:0-buy-the-spike-in-intuit-intu-stock-after-earnings/
Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
"OpenAI, Google, xAI battle for superstar AI talent, shelling out millions",1747821600000,"The contest in Silicon Valley to dominate artificial intelligence is playing out on a new court: superstar researchers.While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters.“The AI labs approach hiring like a game of chess,” said Ariel Herbert-Voss, CEO of cybersecurity startup RunSybil and a former OpenAI researcher who entered the talent fight after launching his own company. “They want to move as fast as possible, so they are willing to pay a lot for candidates with specialized and complementary expertise, much like the game pieces. They are like, do I have enough rooks? Enough knights?”Companies including OpenAI and Google, eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called “ICs” – the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies.Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI’s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech’s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman’s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources – both people and compute – behind the work he was excited about.“It was actually financially not the best option that I had,” he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers. That hasn’t stopped companies from throwing millions of dollars in bonuses and pay packages at star researchers, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever’s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said.Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said. Google declined to comment.In contrast, top engineers at big tech companies receive an average yearly compensation of $281,000 in salary and $261,000 in equity, according to Comprehensive.io, a company that tracks tech industry compensation.10,000x TALENTWhile talent has always been important in Silicon Valley, the difference with the AI boom is how few people are in this elite group – depending on who you ask, the number could range from a few dozen to around a thousand, eight sources told Reuters.That is based on the belief that this very small number of ‘ICs’ have made outsized contributions to the development of large language models, the technology today’s AI boom is based on, and therefore could make or break the success of an AI model. “sure 10x engineers are cool but damn those 10,000x engineer/researchers…,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted in late 2023, alluding to a long held maxim that the best software engineers were 10 times as good as the average (10x), but now in the AI industry, the best researchers are 10,000 times (10,000x) as effective as the average.The September departure of OpenAI’s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, who then founded a rival AI startup, has intensified the AI talent war. Murati, who was known at OpenAI for her management skills and execution prowess, recruited 20 OpenAI employees before announcing her company in February. She has now lured even more researchers from OpenAI and other labs, and the team is now around 60 people, two sources told Reuters. Though the company has no product in the market, Murati is in the middle of closing record-breaking seed round that is, based on the team’s strength. A representative for Murati declined to comment.The scarcity of talent has forced companies to approach hiring creatively. Zeki Data, a data firm focused on identifying top AI talent, said it is employing sports industry data analysis techniques like the one popularized by the movie ""Moneyball"" to identify promising but undiscovered talent. For instance, Zeki Data discovered Anthropic has been hiring researchers with theoretical physics backgrounds, and other AI companies have hired individuals with quantum computing backgrounds.Anthropic did not reply to a request for comment.“On my team, I have extraordinarily talented mathematicians who wouldn't have come to this field if it weren't for the fast progress that we're seeing now,” said Sébastien Bubeck, who left his role as vice president of GenAI research at Microsoft last year to join OpenAI. “We're seeing an influx of talent from all fields going into AI now. And some of these people are very, very clever, and they make a difference.”","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR0XL:0-openai-google-xai-battle-for-superstar-ai-talent-shelling-out-millions/"
Microsoft Could Settle EU Antitrust Probe by Mid-June,1747410112000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT is seeking to defuse EU antitrust scrutiny by offering Office suites without Teams at a reduced price and has drawn the European Commission's request for public feedback on its proposed commitments. Under the plan, Microsoft would sell versions of Office 365 and related productivity bundles without Teams, let customers switch to Teams-free suites mid-contract, enhance interoperability for rival communication apps, and guarantee data portability out of Teams; most obligations run for seven years, while interoperability and portability commitments extend to ten years. The EC said interested parties have until mid-June to submit their views, reflecting its June 2024 statement of objections that accused Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in SaaS productivity apps since April 2019, following Slack's original 2020 complaint. Shares were little changed in premarket trading, trading flat at recent levels. The move follows earlier reports that Microsoft could avoid a hefty EU fine after unpacking its latest offer, and underscores management's aim to balance regulatory concessions without diluting its product bundle strategy. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has signaled that these commitments, if approved, would settle the formal investigation opened in July 2023, but stakeholder feedback will shape any final order. For investors, the proposed remedy could remove a major overhang on Microsoft's valuation in Europe, where cloud and Office subscription growth are core drivers of its double-digit revenue gains. With Azure and AI strategy already cementing long-term growth, resolving the Teams bundling case would help ensure continued momentum in Microsoft's largest non-U.S. market. Investors will watch for the EC's decision after the consultation period closes in the coming weeks.GuruFocus's latest 12-month consensus price target for Microsoft sits at $503.52, implying an 11.1% upside from current levels. The high estimate of $650 signals that some analysts see as much as a 43% rally over the next year, while the low target of $423 suggests limited downside of about 7%.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:f3d37a584094b:0-microsoft-could-settle-eu-antitrust-probe-by-mid-june/
Microsoft Is Rolling Out AI Agents. Developers Are Finding Coding Errors. — Barrons.com,1748032800000,"By Adam LevineThis past week saw two tech titans fighting for attention with dueling developer conferences: Microsoft Build and Google I/O. Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI ""agents."" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, ""fix the build error on apple platforms,"" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. ""How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?"" one developer asked on GitHub.""We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,"" another developer on GitHub said. ""Is the ROI even worth it?""The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: ""We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.""As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.""By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,"" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. ""We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.""Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Will AI Empower the PR Industry or Create Endless Seas of Spam? — WSJ,1747821600000,"By Patrick CoffeePublic-relations agencies email reporters every day with suggestions to cover their clients, but this pitch from March stood out from the flood with its unusual subject line: ""You care more about Tesla than a cancer killing thousands.""The email went on to scold U.S.-based reporters for giving priority to Tesla earnings news and celebrity gossip over the work of Mainz Biomed, a German firm that develops tests for colorectal cancer.After rattling off statistics about increasing cancer rates, it stated, ""This isn't a future problem. It's happening right now. But you wouldn't know, because you've been covering crap that doesn't matter. Do better.""This pitch was generated entirely by an artificial intelligence tool called PRAI, which suggested getting reporters' attention by combining the well-known Tesla name with a confrontational tone, according to Valentin Saitarli, who is chief executive of PRAI and managing director of Exclusive PR Solutions, a public relations firm that represents Mainz Biomed.It succeeded in generating attention — and hostility.""This was an extremely efficient pitch and made lots of people angry, very angry,"" Saitarli said. ""We just wanted to showcase the product and invite to interviews, but we were attacked by so much hate."" Mainz Biomed didn't respond to requests for comment.Is this the future of public relations?The email is an extreme example of AI being applied to PR without proper human oversight, according to communications veterans. But the field is already being changed by AI in other ways.Nearly every major PR firm has named an AI leader, and they have also developed a range of proprietary tools.Edelman, the largest global PR firm by revenue, has built a ""generative engine optimization"" tool to improve clients' image among large language models as search results become less about driving clicks than maintaining reputations.When a client is the subject of negative headlines, the PR firm Golin can use AI to track more real-time responses and test potential responses on synthetic focus groups created by large language models, said Jeff Beringer, chief AI officer at the agency, part of Interpublic Group of Cos.The rise of generative AI has also facilitated a new wave of startups that automatically generate news releases and emails or cater to more niche PR functions.PodPitch was specifically designed to help communications professionals land their clients on podcasts, said co-founder Neal Shulman. Its product uses AI to match users' topical keywords with transcriptions from thousands of podcast episodes and generate personalized pitch emails based on clients' qualifications and the shows they are targeting, Shulman said.Big companies are also deploying AI for their own PR, communications and promotional activities.Microsoft last year developed a generative AI interface that summarizes mentions of Microsoft in news stories, podcasts and social-media posts so its communications team can more quickly develop a response strategy, said Steve Clayton, vice president of communications strategy at Microsoft.The company also uses its Copilot AI tool to develop social-media posts, conduct research and prepare executives for public speeches, but never releases any sort of AI-influenced content without thorough human review, according to Clayton.""We're using it more as an input into the process than an output from the process,"" he said.When food delivery service Grubhub conducted research for a 2024 promotion that focused on meals for women who had just given birth, survey respondents rated sushi and shellfish as their biggest cravings.But when Grubhub used AI-powered facial recognition technology to scrutinize participants' expressions, they saw much greater enthusiasm for cold cuts and sandwiches. Grubhub subsequently edited the campaign's main video to include more comfort foods.""You get a much better, more honest read on how they were feeling about that content versus what they say, because, you know, people are liars sometimes,"" said Dave Tovar, Grubhub's senior vice president of communications and government relations.AI has complicated the jobs of PR people as well.The technology made email outreach less effective by encouraging an ever-larger deluge of spam messages, according to Nick Toso, CEO and co-founder of Rolli, a tool that connects reporters with subject matter experts for their stories.It has also increased the prevalence of artificial ""experts"" designed to trick journalists into quoting their commentary and boosting affiliated businesses' search engine rankings, said Toso, who was previously Washington, D.C., bureau chief and senior producer at CNN's Spanish-language division.Rolli uses AI tools and a team of human researchers to validate experts' identities and qualifications through extensive reviews of their articles, social-media posts and résumés, said Toso.""If we're trying to tell people who the reliable sources are, we should also be able to tell them who the unreliable sources are,"" he said.PR shops can similarly vet influencers for clients more quickly by using AI to review years' of content, thereby ensuring that no past posts or comments could derail a brand's campaign.Some communications professionals remain skeptical that AI can encroach upon the discipline as quickly or as thoroughly as it has in the case of advertising.Communications relies more heavily on the nuances of one-on-one engagement between real humans, according to Wendy Zajack, adjunct faculty at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.Automation and AI-generated content risk getting in the way of that, according to Zajack, and bothering journalists to boot.""I do feel like we might see an allergic reaction to some of this in terms of seeking out really interesting, individualistic content and messaging, because we have just been inundated with a lot of crap,"" she said.Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521003374:0/

Microsoft's AI Bet Just Took a Wild Turn -- And It's Not What You Think,1747408345000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT is making a bold pivot. After Chinese upstart DeepSeek dropped its open-source AI model R1with performance comparable to OpenAI at a tiny fraction of the costSatya Nadella didn't panic. He leaned in. Within days, Microsoft engineers were testing R1, vetting it for security, and plugging it into Azure. Customers can now rent R1 next to OpenAI's priciest tools, and Microsoft still takes a cut. Nadella's bet? AI is rapidly becoming a commodityand when that happens, the real power sits with whoever owns the pipes, not the product.But the bigger story is unfolding behind the scenes. Microsoft's once-cozy relationship with OpenAI has cooled. The four-day leadership coup at OpenAI in late 2023where Sam Altman was fired, hired by Microsoft, then reinstatedshook the partnership. Nadella, once the startup's biggest backer, is now hedging hard. He's ramped up development of in-house models like MAI-2, poached the entire Inflection AI team for $650 million, and is building cheaper, task-specific models that can run Copilot without OpenAI at all. One Microsoft exec called it insurancein case the startup's rocketship hits turbulence.Despite the drama, Microsoft's grip on the enterprise stack is holding strong. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies use Copilot. GitHub Copilot now has more than 15 million users. And while many employees quietly prefer ChatGPT, Microsoft keeps winning the infrastructure game. It doesn't matter if the AI brain behind Copilot comes from OpenAI, DeepSeek, or Microsoft's own labswhat matters is that it runs on Azure, integrates with Teams, and sells add-ons like Copilot Studio. Nadella's endgame isn't to win the model race.

Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS’ Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS’ Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will ‍boast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. These behemoths already have a global-scale AI cloud, whereas NBIS is still expanding its infrastructure. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market.NBIS Stock PerformanceNebius shares have lost 19.5% over the past three months, underscoring broader and company-specific challenges. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector decline of 5.1% and the Zacks Internet Software Services industry’s gain of 4.3%.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its peers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 11.3% and 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame, while Microsoft has gained 10.7%.NBIS' ValuationIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 2.59X, lower than the Internet Software Services industry’s ratio of 4.12, but it could mean more risk than opportunity.Investment Thesis for NBIS StockGiven Nebius' ongoing investments in its core AI infrastructure platform and promising growth in Toloka and Avride platforms, long-term potential remains. However, significant margin pressure owing to ongoing investments and fierce competition from behemoths clouds the outlook. The negative Earnings ESP and muted stock performance further temper expectations. Retaining NBIS stock ahead of earnings appears prudent, but cautious optimism is warranted.What to Do With NBIS Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds in the AI space, it is an exciting growth story, but one with competitive pressures that investors must closely monitor.NBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:fdddaf27b094b:0-how-should-you-play-nebius-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/

"Update: Microsoft-Backed OpenAI Must Offer More Details About Proposed Restructuring, Not For Private Gain Group Says",1747401053000,"(Updates with Microsoft's and OpenAI's response in the seventh, eighth, and ninth paragraphs.)Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's updated May 5 decision that it would continue to be overseen and controlled by its nonprofit may be a ""step in the right direction"" but it must offer more details about the concerns the Not For Private Gain group raised in its April 17 letter, the group said in a Monday letter to California and Delaware Attorneys General Robert Bonta and Kathleen Jennings. The updated May 5 proposal ""does not adequately"" protect governance safeguards, which are about whether the startup ""would continue to have a legally enforceable obligation to advance the charitable mission above all else,"" the letter said. The group, in its April 17 letter to the attorneys general, raised concerns regarding OpenAI's proposed restructuring that would hand over control of the development and deployment of artificial general intelligence to a for-profit enterprise from a nonprofit charity. The Monday letter also said that under the May 5 updated proposal, the only difference is that OpenAI-nonprofit would have ""some"" form of control over OpenAI-public benefit corporation, where directors would not have a ""primary fiduciary duty"" to carry forward the startup's charitable mission ""above all else.""""As the Attorneys General of OpenAI-nonprofit's state of incorporation and the location where its charitable assets are held, you have the authority and responsibility to protect OpenAI-nonprofit's charitable mission and assets,"" the group wrote. The group said that it is not minimizing the ""significance"" of the proposed changes, but it emphasizes to ""underscore the singular importance"" of ensuring that the startup continues to have a ""legally enforceable obligation"" towards the charitable mission. Microsoft referred MT Newswires to OpenAI for comment. ""OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, is today a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit,"" an OpenAI spokesperson referred MT Newswires to the startup's May 5 blog. ""That will not change,"" OpenAI said in the blog. ""We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. We look forward to advancing the details of this plan in continued conversation with them, Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners,"" OpenAI also added in the blog.

Evercore Says Microsoft Could Hit $500 Target,1747400944000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT remains a compelling long-term buy as its AI-driven Azure growth and robust valuation work in its favor, Evercore ISI says. Evercore analysts led by Kirk Materne note MSFT trades at 29x CY26 GAAP EPS, offering an attractive risk/reward balance at current levels, and highlight Azure's AI-consumption run rate surpassing $14 billion alongside sustained 30%+ year-over-year segment growth. They also point out that M365 Copilot revenues hit a $2.5 billion run rate, underscoring the early days of enterprise AI adoption. Shares rebounded from a 17-month low in early April, climbing double digits over the past month and closing within striking distance of last summer's all-time high. Evercore's Outperform rating and $500 price target reflect that conviction. Materne adds that as AI capacity scales and the non-AI side of Azure stabilizes, the cloud arm should sustain 30%+ revenue gains through FY26 and FY27, even assuming some normalization in legacy workloads. He also flags that Microsoft's diversified software moatfrom Office 365 subscriptions to Dynamics and gamingprovides downside protection amid broader tech-sector multiple contraction this year. Evercore's bullish stance contrasts with sector skepticism, where tech multiples have dipped amid rising rates, but MSFT's combination of subscription resilience and AI leadership sets it apart. To further engage investors, Evercore is hosting its annual Microsoft 360 Day next Tuesday, where management is expected to detail data-center expansion plans and AI roadmap milestones. For investors, Microsoft's proven AI monetization and consistent Azure expansion signal durable catalysts that may underpin sustained upside and justify holding through market cycles. Investors will eye FY26 guidance and insights from Microsoft 360 Day next week as key catalysts.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:23b017177094b:0-evercore-says-microsoft-could-hit-500-target/

Largest tech deals of last decade,1747398358000,"Charter Communications said on Friday it would buy privately held rival Cox Communications for $21.9 billion, uniting two of the largest U.S. cable and broadband operators.Below is a list of the largest U.S. technology deals in the last decade:","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RO0TB:0-largest-tech-deals-of-last-decade/"
U.S. Treasuries Might Be Wildly Undervalued. Here's an Example. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"By Martin BaccardaxImagine an innovation-driven global powerhouse, with interests and influence in virtually every country in the world, that ratings companies trust as a fail-safe bet to use investors' borrowed cash wisely and return it timely.Just a few months ago, you could have reliably used that description to characterize the U.S. government and its Treasury bonds. Today, investors are essentially saying the same thing about Microsoft. But that doesn't mean investors should trade in their Treasuries for the Windows and AI-backed paper just yet.Yields on the short-term bonds issued by the world's most valuable company — an AAA-rated tech giant that generates more than $60 billion in year in free cash flow — are trading lower than the yields on equivalent U.S. Treasury notes — from an Aa1-rated government that takes in $4.9 trillion in taxes each year. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields, and lower yields often signify that investors see less risk in holding those securities.For debt with longer maturities, the extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to own Microsoft's 30-year bond — instead of allegedly risk-free 30-year Treasuries — is just 20 basis points. That's the lowest on record, according to data from Bank of America's weekly 'Flow Show' report, and down from more than 100 basis points just two years ago. (One hundred basis points equals one percentage point.)Now, as an investor, there are two possible rationales for this: One, you either think the likelihood of Microsoft paying its coupon on time over the next three decades, and making you whole at the end, is roughly the same as the U.S. government, or, two, you think U.S. Treasuries are wildly undervalued.Signals from BofA's 'Flow Show' report suggest it might be the latter.The 10-year rolling return for a basket of longer-dated Treasuries, based on current pricing, turned negative for the first time in decades this year, according to BofA figures. The return of around -1.3%, in fact, matched the ""humiliating place stock returns were"" during the market's trough in February 2009, during the global financial crisis, the bank said.Sharp-eyed readers will note, of course, that stocks bottomed out the following month and embarked on the longest bull run in financial market history, with the S&P 500 delivering annualized returns of 17.8% for each of the next 10 years.U.S. Treasuries might not be ready for that kind of roaring gain. But after Moody's stripped the government of its coveted AAA-status last week and 30-year bond yields topped 5.15% earlier this week, the highest since 2007, investors are starting to see value.Around $25 billion in new money found its way into bond portfolios in the latest week, BofA's flow report indicated, outpacing the $16 billion moved into cash. Stock funds, meanwhile, suffered their first outflows in two months, losing $4.1 billion even as the S&P 500 rallied to within 3% of its all time high.Oscar Wilde once noted that a cynic is the sort of person that knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. As Treasuries sold off this week, there appeared to be plenty of cynics focused on the government bonds' levels and the impact of U.S. fiscal profligacy, discounting the value in the trade as a result.Long-dated yields are moving lower in early Friday trading, and could rally even further next week if minutes from the Federal Reserve's May policy meeting hint another rate cut or a tamer-than-expected reading of the April's personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, inflation gauge.""[There is] nothing more contrarian in 2025 than being long the long-end, "" BofA writes. ""And while the 2020s spending of Biden's Build Back Better + taxation of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill don't a AAA-rating make, we say return of bond vigilantes to (the 5% level on 30-year Treasury yields) is a cyclical buy opportunity.""Write to editors@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Microsoft makes Office-Teams offer to avert EU antitrust fine,1747392864000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT has offered to make its Office product without Teams cheaper than when sold with Teams, EU antitrust regulators said on Friday, which could spare the company a big fine and ease tensions with the United States.The European Commission said it would seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Reuters was the first to report the proposal earlier this week.If accepted, it would end a long-running case triggered by a 2020 complaint from Salesforce-owned NYSE:CRM Slack, which could have resulted in a massive antitrust fine for the U.S. tech giant. Germany's alfaview also complained.Microsoft's Vice President for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde said in a blogpost the proposal was a clear and complete resolution to concerns raised by rivals and would give Europeans more choice.Its offer would allow Europeans to buy Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams for less than corresponding suites that include Teams, the EU competition enforcer said.Microsoft said the maximum price differential between the two suites would be 8 euros ($9).The proposal would also allow rivals to inter-operate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functionalities, embed Office web applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint in their own products, and integrate their products in Microsoft's core productivity applications.Customers in Europe would be able to extract their Teams messaging data for use in competing solutions. The pricing offer would be valid for seven years and interoperability for 10 years.Microsoft, which has accrued 2.2 billion euros in EU antitrust fines in past years, said it would align the options and pricing for its suites and Teams service globally if the EU regulator accepts its offer.""We are hopeful that following the market test, the European Commission will conclude that the proposed commitments resolve its concerns and in the following months adopt a final decision closing its investigation,"" Microsoft's Linde said.Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.

"OpenAI's Biggest Data Center Secures $11.6 Billion in Funding, Crusoe Says — WSJ",1747819800000,"By Berber JinA Texas data center that the startup Crusoe is building for OpenAI has secured $11.6 billion in new funding commitments, expanding a site that is core to increasing the ChatGPT maker's long-term computing capabilities.The funding, a mixture of debt and equity, will expand the data center to eight buildings from two and increase the total amount secured for the project to $15 billion, Crusoe said. Both Crusoe and investment firm Blue Owl Capital are contributing cash to the data center project as part of the latest financing.The data center, which is slated for completion next year, is expected to be the largest used by OpenAI. Each of the buildings will run up to 50,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips, which are commonly used for training large language models.The development of the Abilene site is a key step in reducing OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft in the race to build the next generation of AI models. For years, the startup exclusively relied on Microsoft for its computing power, but grew frustrated that the tech giant wasn't keeping up with demand. Last spring, it struck a deal with Oracle to use the Abilene site after receiving the signoff from Microsoft.Longer term, OpenAI aims to build and operate its own network of data centers. In January, Chief Executive Sam Altman unveiled a $500 billion infrastructure project called Stargate alongside the Japanese tech investor SoftBank and cloud firm Oracle. OpenAI said at the time that it was evaluating sites across the country for Stargate, though details have so far been scarce.Earlier this month, Altman posted a photo of him visiting the Abilene site on X, wearing an Oracle construction vest: ""great to see progress on the first stargate in abilene with our partners at oracle today. will be the biggest ai training facility in the world,"" he wrote.Crusoe began construction on the Abilene site last June after Oracle agreed to lease the data center for 15 years. OpenAI separately struck an agreement with Oracle to rent servers from the facility. Oracle plans to supply the data center with the Nvidia chips.Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521003187:0/

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:META vs. MSFT: Which AI Superpower Is a Better Buy?Meta Platforms and Microsoft have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies.Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents.

Meta Platforms’ average surprise of 17.3% is better than Microsoft’s surprise of 5.21%, reflecting good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: META is Cheaper Than MSFTBoth Meta Platforms and Microsoft are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Meta Platforms shares are trading at 8.57X, lower than Microsoft’s 10.9X.ConclusionAlthough both Microsoft and Meta Platforms are leveraging AI to boost their prospects Microsoft is better positioned compared with META given strong adoption of Copilot, Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business.Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Meta Platforms, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA, Bank of America, Microsoft and Oracle",1747392000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp. BAC, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Oracle Corp. ORCL.Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million.NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China.Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years.Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA?Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products.Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corp. is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corp. has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips.While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price.This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock.However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Salesforce and Microsoft,1747996020000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 23, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Salesforce CRM and Microsoft MSFT.Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down -2% Ahead of Earnings?Salesforce stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM's slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28.The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service.CRM's growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce's offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce's transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM's Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce's new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program ""agents"" for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development.Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said ""nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,"" and all of its ""top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.""The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, ""achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation."" The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce's AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company's EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT's 1,700% and Tech's 720%.Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector's 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft's 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech's 115% and Microsoft's 150%.CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech's 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM's PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels. C3.ai currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:97dfa7506094b:0-c3-ai-trading-at-a-premium-at-6-39x-time-to-hold-or-sell-the-stock/
EU Seeks Feedback on Microsoft's Offer to End Teams Antitrust Investigation,1747389900000,"By Edith HancockThe European Commission is seeking feedback on concessions Microsoft has offered in a bid to end an antitrust investigation into how it offers its Teams platform to customers in the European Union.The commission said Friday that Microsoft has offered to make its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites available without Teams at a reduced rate and allow existing customers to switch to using those suites without Teams. The company has also pledged to offer platforms that compete with Teams better interoperability with Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to facilitate using competing products.Microsoft also said that if the commitments become binding it will align its worldwide suites offers and pricing with its EU plans, the commission said. The regulator is now asking for industry feedback on those commitments.The European Union executive had started investigating how Microsoft offers its software to customers following a complaint from rival Slack Technologies. Germany's Alfaview also complained.Nanna-Louise Linde, Microsoft's vice president of European government affairs, said in a blog post on Friday that the commitments ""represent a clear and complete resolution to the concerns raised by our competitors and will provide European customers with more choices.""Write to Edith Hancock at edith.hancock@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250516002079:0-eu-seeks-feedback-on-microsoft-s-offer-to-end-teams-antitrust-investigation/

"Microsoft, Google Events Provide Opportunity to Close Gap With OpenAI, Wedbush Says",1747754484000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google's developer conferences are vital events in the artificial intelligence revolution as the companies plan to catch up with OpenAI, Wedbush said in a note Tuesday. The Microsoft Build and Google I/O conferences prioritize seeking developers to create AI apps and use cases on their platforms as agentic AI transformation speeds up, analysts including Daniel Ives said. Microsoft detailed at its ongoing conference how AI agents are enabling companies to manage the Windows operating system as well as code across functional verticals, according to the note. Wedbush said Microsoft expects 1.3 billion agents to be deployed by 2028. The Google I/O conference is crucial for the company amid concerns around the future of search in an AI-driven world, Wedbush said. The company has been actively innovating and closing the gap in the AI race through its Gemini AI services, the brokerage noted, adding that it expects Google to unveil new AI innovations coming to Google and Gemini for developers. ""We believe Gemini is help closing the gap vs. ChatGPT, and Google I/O is a key event to highlight AI innovations and technology coming to the Google developer world.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia and Broadcom",1747382280000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO.3 Reasons U.S. Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

FTC drops case over Microsoft's $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal,1747947638000,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission dropped a case that sought to block Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT $69 billion purchase of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard, saying on Thursday that pursuing the case against the long-closed deal was not in the public interest.FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson is seeking to use the agency's resources for cases that fit with President Donald Trump 's agenda, such as a probe related to whether advertisers colluded to spend less on X first reported by Reuters on Thursday. Ferguson is beginning to shut down some efforts started by his predecessor Lina Khan, including dropping a case on Thursday that had accused PepsiCo NASDAQ:PEP of price discrimination that favored Walmart NYSE:WMT .The FTC lost an appeal on May 7 seeking to reverse a judge's decision declining to block the Microsoft-Activision deal, which closed in 2023.Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Thursday that the FTC's decision to drop the case was ""a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C.""When challenging a new merger, the FTC typically asks a judge to temporarily block the deal to give the agency time to challenge it in its own administrative court. But deals that are temporarily blocked are often abandoned.Though the FTC lost its case seeking to block the deal temporarily, the agency could have sought to unwind the acquisition at a trial that was scheduled for July.The Activision Blizzard transaction marked the largest-ever acquisition in the video gaming market.

Group that opposed OpenAI's restructuring raises concerns about new revamp plan,1747344070000,"A group that opposed OpenAI's restructuring wrote in a letter this week that the startup's new organizational plan still does not go far enough to safeguard the ChatGPT creator from generating dangerous artificial intelligence technology.The letter dated May 12 was submitted to the California and Delaware attorneys-general by members of a group that calls itself Not For Private Gain. The letter said OpenAI's announcement this month to dial back some restructuring ""might be a step in the right direction,"" yet it does not adequately ensure that OpenAI sticks to its original mission to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The group of critics includes former OpenAI employees and AI experts such as Geoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist known as ""the Godfather of AI."" They objected to OpenAI's proposed reorganization because they said it would have put investors' profit motives ahead of public good. OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, who now is a competitor through his company xAI, also objected to the proposal on the same grounds, and is suing OpenAI for breaching the company’s founding contract. OpenAI dialed back its plan to restructure to remove control from its nonprofit parent entity in May after a firestorm of criticism that included that group's initial letter opposing the plan. OpenAI, in which Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT has invested more than $13 billion, now plans to convert its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC), with the nonprofit parent controlling the PBC and becoming a ""big shareholder"" in it. OpenAI says this will allow it to raise more capital to keep pace in the expensive AI race.A PBC is a structure designed to balance shareholder returns with social goals, unlike nonprofits, which are solely focused on public good.Monday's letter from opponents says the new plan still enables the company to put profits ahead of public good. First, OpenAI's current for-profit entity is required to advance its mission and charter above any investor interests, while the proposed PBC is not required to do so, it said.Second, OpenAI's nonprofit, as the sole manager, has 100% control over its for-profit entity today, granting it day-to-day operational power such as the ability to fire executives. In the proposed restructuring, the nonprofit would not have comprehensive control over the PBC, which the group said is concerning because the attorneys general derive their enforcement powers solely from the nonprofit's authority. OpenAI disagreed with the group's characterization, saying in a statement: ""The nonprofit would continue to have control over the PBC, full stop. Any suggestion otherwise is not accurate."" A lawyer for Elon Musk agreed with the letter, called OpenAI's new proposal ""nothing but window dressing.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RN0VA:0-group-that-opposed-openai-s-restructuring-raises-concerns-about-new-revamp-plan/"

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

Microsoft-backed OpenAI Enters Hardware Era In $6.5 Billion Deal,1747945516000,"OpenAI is venturing into hardware with its $6.5 billion acquisition of Sir Jony Ive's io, aiming to launch AI-powered companions by 202627 that blend unobtrusive design with real-world awareness.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities calls physical AI the next critical trend and sees the Ive partnership as a strategic play to marry leading AI models with Apple NASDAQ:AAPL -grade industrial design. Prototypes, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, pack cameras and microphones for environmental detection in a screen-less form factor roughly the size of an iPod Shufflewearable around the neck and leveraging connected PCs or smartphones for displays. Kuo's industry checks point to mass production in 2027, with assembly outside China to minimize geopolitical risk.The deal injects design heft into Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT - and SoftBank-backed OpenAI, which paid $5 billion in stock and expanded its existing 23% io stake valued at $1.5 billion. Altman and Ive emphasize stealth to prevent rivals from cloning their concept and reference Alan Kay's dictum that serious software players must craft their own hardware. This pivot follows Google's NASDAQ:GOOG I/O AI showcase and underscores OpenAI's bid to shift the narrative back in its favor.Why It Matters Investors should note that integrating cutting-edge AI with premium hardware could unlock higher margins and create stickier consumer offerings, elevating OpenAI's competitive moat against Big Tech's software-only strategy.Investors will look for prototype demos at year-end events and monitor official launch timing as the company refines specs ahead of a late-2026 debut.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:539777670094b:0-microsoft-backed-openai-enters-hardware-era-in-6-5-billion-deal/

Google to unveil AI upgrades at I/O conference amid search challenges,1747746000000,"Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google kicks off its annual developer conference on Tuesday with a flurry of announcements showcasing its huge investment in artificial intelligence, while seeking to fend off concerns over the future of its business.The I/O conference in Mountain View, California has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's long-time stronghold organizing and retrieving information on the internet.In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's ChatGPT.Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta NASDAQ:META .Now, with consumer usage of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking how aggressive Google is in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue.Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple NASDAQ:AAPL executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari web browser for the first time.In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics.A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years.The analysts pointed to a behavioral shift drawing consumers towards AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines.Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser.Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs.Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries.Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a ""universal AI agent.""At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time.The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat.Meanwhile, Google is growing other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by ""millions"" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR121:0-google-to-unveil-ai-upgrades-at-i-o-conference-amid-search-challenges/"

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

OpenAI Update Offers 'Path Forward'-But With Gaps,1747340722000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed OpenAI's updated its plan to spin its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporationand it's a mixed bag. On May 5, the company said it would keep its nonprofit parent in the driver's seat, legally bound to consider the public good as it eyes an eventual IPO. In theory, that lets investors chase returns without steering the mission off course. But a watchdog group called Not For Private Gain isn't convinced: they've fired off a letter to the attorneys general in California and Delaware saying this tweak still leaves too many loopholes. Profits aren't capped, there's no guarantee that extra cash flows back to the nonprofit, and if the nonprofit board can't force the issue, neither can state regulators.Despite that pushback, OpenAI's board seems willing to listenactivists even praised them as open-minded for rolling out this version. Now the guardrails are on the table: capped payouts, ironclad profit-redistribution rules and clear, enforceable language that the charitable mission trumps everything else. The group has until May 29 to nail down stronger commitments, or they'll press the AGs to step in. Bottom line: how OpenAI squares investor incentives with its lofty mission could make or break its trust with researchers, regulators and future shareholdersand ultimately shape the path to its IPO.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:b8f9b6516094b:0-openai-update-offers-path-forward-but-with-gaps/
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Moody's, Broadcom, Microsoft and CoreWeave",1747743960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Moody's MCO, Broadcom AVGO, Microsoft MSFT and CoreWeave CRWV.U.S. Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech BoomsIn poker, a ""tell"" is a player's subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, ""If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?""Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market's resilient reaction to the Moody's downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Market Chatter: Microsoft-backed Builder.ai's Former Executives Said to Have Reported 'Bogus' Sales,1747935934000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed Builder.ai collapsed followed an internal inquiry, which found that the company's former executives allegedly reported ""bogus"" sales to the board, The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing people close to the matter. The provisional accounts submitted by the technology startup to its auditor showed that the company revised its 2024 revenue estimates to about $55 million from a previously reported estimate of $220 million. It also reduced its previously reported 2023 total sales revenue of $180 million to about $45 million, the report said, citing the people. The prior revenue figures were submitted to the board when founder Sachin Dev Duggal was CEO, the report said. Duggal resigned as CEO along with Builder.ai's Chief Revenue Officer Varghese Cherian in early 2025, according to the report. The people familiar with the matter said that sales, which were previously booked, remained outstanding for an extended period of time due to Duggal's departure, raising concerns regarding revenue recognition. This eventually led to hiring of a law firm by the board to investigate the matter. The law firm shared its findings, which showed that there may have been a coordinated effort to inflate revenue at the company, the report said. Builder.ai said Tuesday it would enter insolvency proceedings and appoint an administrator to oversee the company's affairs.

"Should You Buy, Hold or Sell OKTA Stock Before Q1 Earnings Release?",1747930320000,"Okta OKTA is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 27.For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, Okta anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of 76-77 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy? ",1747335600000,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia’s Humain, the query arises on AMD’s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let’s analyze. Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIA Several semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals. AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn’t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives. NVIDIA, too, has partnered with Humain to sell over 18,000 AI-focused chips, amounting to nearly $700 million. NVIDIA plans to sell its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to the Saudi firm soon, and its GB300 Blackwell chips are expected to power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. This has mitigated the Trump administration’s ban on NVIDIA selling H20 chips to China. Thus, it’s evident that the AI trade has mutually benefited NVIDIA and AMD without a clear winner. According to Bank of America Corporation BAC analyst Vivek Arya, NVIDIA and AMD’s strategic partnership with Humain is estimated to be worth $15 billion to $20 billion over the next five years. Is There Any Way AMD Can Outperform NVIDIA? Sheer dominance in the GPU space has made NVIDIA’s products costly, with primarily magnificent-7 companies being its customers. AMD, on the other hand, can compete with NVIDIA on price and cater to customers who can’t afford NVIDIA’s pricey products. Having said that, large companies are also finding ways to build AI infrastructure cost-effectively. That’s why Microsoft Corporation MSFT is using AMD’s MI300X chips, and Oracle Corporation ORCL has signed up for MI355X GPUs, which can pose serious challenges to NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell chips. While these factors may increase AMD’s data center revenue and share price, expecting its stock to outperform NVIDIA is improbable. This is because the increase in AI data center spending will fuel NVIDIA’s stock growth. The popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the high demand for Blackwell chips are likely to boost NVIDIA’s quarterly performance, driving up its share price. This is the reason why brokers have raised NVIDIA’s average short-term price target by 27.8% to $166.10 from the previous $129.93.Whereas, brokers have increased AMD’s average short-term price target by 13.8% to $128.03 from the previous $112.46 (read more: Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?).Here’s How to Trade AMD Stock NowWhile AMD may not surpass NVIDIA’s shares, it is well-positioned to gain momentum through the Saudi AI deal. AMD also recently announced a $6 billion share repurchase program, indicating management’s optimism about the company’s future. The share buyback program would reduce outstanding shares and raise the value of the remaining shares, and benefit stakeholders, so they should keep the stock. However, AMD stock is pricey. According to the price/earnings ratio, AMD trades at 28.7X forward earnings. But, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry’s forward earnings multiple is 20.9X. Therefore, new entrants should wait for a more affordable price on AMD stock to avoid overspending. For now, AMD stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Meta Platforms vs. Microsoft: Which AI Superpower is a Better Buy?,1747335600000,"Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA.

Elon Musk's AI Just Landed on Microsoft Azure -- And It Might Change Everything,1747685190000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT is adding Elon Musk's Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini models to its Azure AI Foundry, deepening its reach into the generative AI battlefield. The move comes as part of Microsoft's broader strategy to become the go-to platform for building and deploying AI applications. With this addition, Azure now offers more than 1,900 model variantsincluding from OpenAI, Meta, and DeepSeekwhile Google and Anthropic remain noticeably absent. The inclusion of Grok follows a recent controversy where the model, embedded in Musk's social platform X, surfaced misleading contenta misstep xAI attributed to an unauthorized modification. Despite this, Microsoft is pressing ahead, offering developers more model optionality at a time when enterprise demand for flexibility is rising.At its annual Build developer conference, Microsoft showcased several updates aimed at strengthening its AI infrastructure. Among them: new tools to help businesses manage AI agentssoftware designed to act on a user's behalf. Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott emphasized that for agents to be useful, they need to talk to everything in the world. The company is also joining the steering committee for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, a technical standard that governs how AI systems interactdespite Anthropic's own models still being unavailable on Azure. Microsoft is clearly positioning itself not just as a cloud vendor, but as the connective tissue for AI innovation across the industry.The company's AI business is gaining traction fast. Microsoft previously guided to at least $13 billion in annualized revenue across its AI offerings, which include both infrastructure and application layers. At Build, it introduced a model leaderboard, a tool to recommend the best model for a given task, and new systems to help enterprises train AI using their proprietary data. The addition of Grok brings a high-profileif somewhat controversialplayer into Microsoft's expanding ecosystem. It could help Microsoft draw more developers who want alternatives to OpenAI while further entrenching Azure as the cloud platform of choice in the generative AI arms race.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:3883e3701094b:0-elon-musk-s-ai-just-landed-on-microsoft-azure-and-it-might-change-everything/

"US Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech Booms",1747682700000,"US Stocks Brush Aside Moody’s DowngradeIn poker, a “tell” is a player’s subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody’s ( MCO ) credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, “If bad news can’t bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?”Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics Present BeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.Image Source: BeSpoke Investment Group The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom ( AVGO ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there’s anything baseball’s steroid era taught, it’s that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China. Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950 S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Image Source: Carson Investment ResearchBottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market’s resilient reaction to the Moody’s downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:bf8993135094b:0-us-stocks-brush-off-moody-s-echo-past-tech-booms/

"Microsoft Stock Remains a Buy, Analysts Say. Why They Think Shares Can Rise 20%. — Barrons.com",1747331460000,"By Nate WolfAfter a year of lagging behind its Magnificent Seven peers, Microsoft stock has plenty of room to rise in the year ahead, Wall Street analysts say.On Thursday, analysts at both Citi and Evercore issued positive outlooks for Microsoft, citing the strength of the tech giant's Azure cloud-computing arm, the payoff from its enterprise artificial-intelligence investments, and the cost savings of recent job cuts.Citi, which has a Buy rating on the stock, lifted its target price to $540 from $480 — a roughly 20% increase from Wednesday's close of $450.44. Evercore maintained its $500 price target and Outperform rating ahead of the investment bank's Microsoft 360 Day event on May 20.The stamps of approval from Wall Street are welcome news for Microsoft as it battles to keep pace with other megacap tech stocks.Over the past year, the company's 12-month price-to-earnings ratio has gained just 7%, compared with 29% for Roundhill's Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, according to data from FactSet.Trimming costs could help. Microsoft said Tuesday it will reduce its workforce by around 3%, equaling several thousand employees. A company spokesperson told Barron's the cuts would ""best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.""Citi analysts see the layoffs as a positive, estimating they could save Microsoft roughly 4%, or $2.5 billion a year, in operating expenses.Meanwhile, the days of massive capital spending growth associated with AI infrastructure might finally be over, Evercore's analysts noted. They predict year-over-year capital expenditure growth has likely peaked. All that past investment now has the potential to pay off down the road.""While the cost burden related to new AI infrastructure is being felt today, the revenue associated with these investments will be recognized for years to come,"" the Evercore analysts wrote.The AI boom could be particularly helpful for Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business, which had seen growth fluctuate in past quarters.At the start of the month, Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, buoyed by 33% year-over-year growth for Azure. And both groups of analysts now estimate Azure revenue will grow more than 30% through the company's next fiscal year.With growth in its core business areas stabilizing and expenses under control after a surge in AI investment, Microsoft could be in line for a strong finish to the calendar year.The tech giant is already off to a solid start. Microsoft shares were up 7.3% this year as of Wednesday's close, while the S&P 500 has risen 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has dropped 0.9%.Write to Nate Wolf at nate.wolf@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Microsoft Sues To Curb Lumma Stealer Threat,1747924465000,"On Wednesday, Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Digital Crimes Unit brought suit on May 13 against Lumma Stealer, an information-stealing malware used by hundreds of threat actors to siphon passwords, credit-card data, bank details and cryptocurrency wallets.Between March 16 and May 16, Microsoft detected over 394,000 Windows PCs infected with Luma Stealer, according to assistant general counsel Steven Masada in a company blog post. Leveraging a U.S. court order, the DCU seized or took down roughly 2,300 malicious domains forming Lumma's command-and-control backbone. Simultaneously, the Department of Justice disrupted the malware's central servers and online marketplaces, while Europol's EC3 and Japan's JC3 suspended locally based infrastructure nodesmarking one of the most extensive multinational takedowns of an info-stealer to date.The growth and resilience of Lumma Stealer highlights the broader evolution of cybercrime and underscores the need for layered defenses and industry collaboration to counter threats, Microsoft said in a separate post. Analysts note this legal offensive follows earlier DCU actions against other high-profile info-stealers and could pressure peers such as CrowdStrike NASDAQ:CRWD and Palo Alto Networks NASDAQ:PANW to accelerate feature rollouts. Compared with a similar takedown of TrickBot in October 2024, which involved 1,100 domains and an estimated 150,000 infections, this operation more than doubles the scale of disruption.Why It Matters This aggressive move not only hampers Lumma's infrastructure but also underscores Microsoft's growing role as both defender and regulator, signaling to investors its commitment to bolstering enterprise-security offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e4eb38b37094b:0-microsoft-sues-to-curb-lumma-stealer-threat/
CoreWeave Scores a Google Win and More Business from OpenAI — Barrons.com,1747321740000,"By Tae KimCoreWeave shares were wavering in early trading Thursday after the AI cloud firm reported better-than-expected revenue for its initial quarter as a public company.While stocks often react to short-term news in the wake of quarterly results, CoreWeave offered some long-term good news for investors: it's starting to win significant business from major technology companies beyond its largest customer Microsoft.Late Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter with a loss of $1.49 per share. Revenue came in at $981.6 million, up 420% year-over-year, which was above analysts' expectations for $857 million.CoreWeave said it expects revenue in the current quarter to range from $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion versus the $988 million consensus. For the full year, the company expects revenue to range from $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, compared with the $4.66 billion estimate. The company also guided its 2025 capex to a range of $20 billion to $23 billion, which was higher than analysts' $19.3 billion estimate, according to FactSet.CoreWeave stock has wavered from positive to negative territory in the wake of the earnings report. Shares are currently up 0.7% in late-morning trading on Thursday.The stock is volatile on a day-to-day basis and had rallied 6.6% on Wednesday heading into the earnings report.""Demand for our platform is robust and accelerating as AI leaders seek the highly performant AI cloud infrastructure required for the most advanced applications,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in a press release. ""We are scaling as fast as possible to capture that demand.""In an interview with Barron's after the earnings call, Intrator said he is optimistic about the future prospects of a new hyperscaler customer that was signed in the first quarter. While he wouldn't name the new customer, the CoreWeave website now shows Google as a customer, which hasn't been disclosed in the past. Intrator also said that the faster Nvidia innovates on new GPUs, the better it is for CoreWeave as they are better equipped to quickly bring the new technology to customers.In the company's 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, CoreWeave also revealed it has entered into an agreement for additional services worth up to $4 billion through April 2029 with OpenAI.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated his Buy Rating on CoreWeave, citing the company's strong revenue outlook and customer wins. The ""top AI players keep knocking on CRWV's door,"" he wrote. ""We see no sign of AI compute tailwinds easing up soon & see CRWV as a multi-yr winner.""Not everyone was positive about CoreWeave's first quarter. Skeptics pointed to the high level of interest and depreciation expenses that made up 72% of revenue in the quarter, reflecting CoreWeave's high risk business model that uses large amounts of debt and capital expenditures. Backlog also edged down sequentially and Microsoft still constituted the vast majority of CoreWeave's revenue at 72%, reflecting customer concentration risk.On Thursday DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded CoreWeave to Underperform from Neutral, citing the high level of capital expenditures needed to sustain the business. He wrote that the results ""confirm our concern that CoreWeave is not a business worth scaling.""It has been a wild ride for CoreWeave since the company priced its initial public offering at $40 in late March. The pricing came in below the initial expected range, but the stock has since rallied more than 50% from its offer price as large technology companies gave robust guidance for their 2025 capex spending during earnings season.CoreWeave was founded in 2017 and provides large-scale access to graphics processing units, or GPUs, via the cloud. With physical GPUs expensive and in hot demand, it has become a much needed service for both start-ups and more mature enterprises. CoreWeave also has a close partnership with Nvidia, which invested in the start-up when it was private and as part of the IPO.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

SentinelOne Rises 25% in a Month: Should You Still Buy the Stock?,1747674840000,"SentinelOne ’s S shares have surged 25% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Security industry’s return of 19.4% and the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 22.8%. The recent outperformance can be attributed to the company’s strong AI-powered portfolio, rich partner base and expanding clientele despite stiff competition.In the cybersecurity space, SentinelOne is facing stiff competition from the likes of Okta OKTA, Broadcom AVGO and Microsoft MSFT. While Okta’s main focus is on identity management, Broadcom’s Symantec is a traditional legacy antivirus suite. Microsoft’s Defender suite is broadly integrated with its own operating system, lacking openness with third-party platforms.Meanwhile, SentinelOne’s Singularity platform is a complete AI-native and provides security at multiple levels, including endpoint, cloud, identity and data through a single interface. The Purple AI provides investigation, real-time threat detection and automated response through its generative AI-powered security analysis, substantially reducing the response time of enterprises. SentinelOne’s modular and multi-cloud compatible architecture gives it a first mover advantage compared to its peers as it offers a more modern and AI-driven solution to enterprises, leading the way into the future.However, SentinelOne stock has underperformed its competitors over the past month. Okta, Broadcom and Microsoft shares have appreciated 37.7%, 37.5% and 26.5%, respectively, over the same time.SentinelOne, Inc. Price and Consensus SentinelOne, Inc. price-consensus-chart | SentinelOne, Inc. QuoteSentinelOne Benefits From Product Innovation and Rich Partner BaseSentinelOne is expanding its reach in the market with an impressive partner base, which includes some of the top names in the industry, like Alphabet, Lenovo and Amazon Web Services (AWS), among others.S has integrated its services with platform solution providers like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Okta and Microsoft to provide seamless security workflows to its end users. The Purple AI platform helps secure Gen AI applications on the Amazon bedrock, whereas the Singularity Cloud workload helps secure AWS containerized workloads.In fourth-quarter 2025, 12+ new large Managed Security Service Providers adopted SentinelOne’s AI SIEM, CNAPP and Purple AI modules, enhancing recurring revenues. By the end of the previous quarter, the company had more than 14000 direct customers and saw a 25% increase in customers with ARR exceeding $100,000. The total number of such customers stood at 1411 by the end of January 2025.In April 2025, SentinelOne partnered with Nord Security to provide SMBs with an integrated endpoint and network security solution, increasing the revenue potential for both companies.In May 2025, SetinelOne received FedRAMP High Authorization for its Purple AI, Singularity Cloud Security CNAPP and Singularity Hyperautomation solutions. This authorisation provides the company with the opportunity to sell its services to federal agencies, public sector and critical infrastructure organisations, driving top-line growth.SentinelOne Offers Strong Q1 and FY2026 GuidanceSentinelOne has provided positive guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2026.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues to be around $228 million, indicating 22% growth year over year.

Microsoft to offer rival AI models from own data center; launches AI coding agent,1747670414000,"Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT said on Monday it would offer new AI models made by Elon Musk 's xAI, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META and European startups Mistral and Black Forest Labs hosted in its own data centers, and unveiled a new artificial-intelligence tool designed to complete software coding tasks on its own.The announcements, made at Microsoft's annual Build software developer conference in Seattle, Washington, underscored the changing nature of Microsoft's relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Microsoft has backed and which announced a directly competing product last week.Microsoft has recently situated itself as a more neutral player in the AI arms race, showing less appetite to shell out huge sums of cash to fund OpenAI's research ambitions while also working with a broader array of AI players, all with an eye on expanding sales while keeping a lid on costs.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the new offerings from xAI, Meta and others will be provided with the same reliability guarantees that come with OpenAI models hosted by Microsoft.""That's just a game-changer in terms of how you think about models and model provisioning,"" Nadella told conference attendees during a keynote address. ""It's exciting for us as developers to be able to mix and match and use them all.""Microsoft's new GitHub Copilot feature is what is known as a coding agent, an AI tool designed to help developers with coding tasks. While previous iterations of Microsoft's AI coding tools could automatically generate bits of code based on what a developer was already doing, the agent is designed to go much further.The agent will take a few instructions from a human - such as a description of a software bug and a strategy for how to fix it - and then get to work, alerting the human to review its work once it has finished coding.OpenAI last week released a preview of a similar agent that it calls Codex.At the Build conference on Monday, Microsoft laid out a vision of a world in which businesses will craft agents of their own for various tasks inside a business. Its primary offering in that area is called Azure Foundry - a service that lets businesses build their own agents based on the AI model of their choice.Those agents are likely to be built with a mix of different AI models, Asha Sharma, corporate vice president for product of Microsoft AI platforms, told Reuters.Microsoft on Monday said it would offer xAI's Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models on its cloud services as well as Meta's Llama models and offerings from French startup Mistral and German startup Black Forest Labs, bringing the total number of models it offers to Azure customers to more than 1,900.Significantly, those models will run within Microsoft's own data centers, meaning Microsoft can make promises about their availability in an era when popular models are often plagued by outages when demand outstrips the capacity to serve them. Sharma said Microsoft plans to add more popular models soon.""One of the most important parts to be able to build an app and seamlessly use the most popular models is making sure your reserved capacity that you have with Azure OpenAI starts to work across the most popular models,"" Sharma said.Microsoft also said on Monday that it was creating a way for AI agents to have the same kind of digital identifier as human employees inside a company's systems.""The concept of treating agents as digital employees is the kind of groundbreaking change that will both open some impressive new capabilities but also raise concerns about the impact that AI is going to make in the workplace,"" said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RR0U5:0-microsoft-to-offer-rival-ai-models-from-own-data-center-launches-ai-coding-agent/"

Microsoft and OpenAI Just Hit Reset—Here’s Why MSFT Stock Wins,1747319400000,"Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT and OpenAI have announced that they are looking to  reset their partnership . The reset is the latest chapter in a story that’s been building between the two companies for the last six years. In this case, it should be profitable for MSFT stock . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI started in 2019 with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft. Over the next several years, that investment grew to over  $13 billion , giving Microsoft access to OpenAI’s  ChatGPT generative AI program . In that time, Microsoft built its network of AI agents (i.e., Copilots) that ran on top of ChatGPT.This relationship vaulted Microsoft to the forefront of the AI race, and shareholders were the beneficiaries. MSFT stock has delivered a  total return of over 140% in the last five years.However, since 2023, the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has become more strained, starting with OpenAI’s decision to fire Sam Altman in December 2022 . At that point, the company’s partnership was yielding positive benefits for both sides . But it also crystallized the idea that the partnership would have to evolve or end.Breaking Up Is Hard to DoIn January 2025, OpenAI and Microsoft seemed to be heading for a messy breakup . At that time, Microsoft confirmed that it was no longer going to be OpenAI’s sole cloud provider . However, OpenAI was making a “ new, large commitment ” to Microsoft’s AI cloud computing platform, Azure .OpenAI was planning to place its business under the control of a for-profit business . That plan has now been abandoned. However, the company’s goals of being a public company haven’t ended, and it will now be financed by none other than Microsoft .That’s right. While the terms of the new funding aren’t completely clear, it appears that OpenAI will be using some of the $13 billion from Microsoft to fund an initial public offering (IPO) . But the plot thickens. Microsoft is expected to have an undefined level of equity in OpenAI’s new business. However, reports are saying that Microsoft may be willing to reduce its equity stake if OpenAI allows Microsoft to have access to new technology developed by OpenAI after the 2030 cutoff .This would be a key concession from OpenAI and it would be yet another reason for long-term investors to be bullish on MSFT stock . [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:MSFT] The OpenAI News Allows MSFT Shareholders to Focus on the Bigger PictureMicrosoft stock is up about 3% in a week when the bulls returned to Wall Street. That’s far below the returns of other technology stocks like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ:NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ:AAPL that have gained 15% and 7% , respectively.However, Microsoft had less to catch up on. Over the last month, MSFT stock is up 18.9% . This cements the notion that Microsoft is a tariff-proof stock . The company will have some exposure to tariffs with its Xbox system . But overall, the company’s software products are immune to tariff concerns .That said, the company has trimmed  its workforce by 3% in the last week. Those cuts, which included many management positions, aren’t being made because of AI efficiencies. Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of what it perceives as a weaker environment for consumer spending on items like video game consoles and personal computers.At 36x earnings , MSFT stock is trading at a slight premium to its historical averages and near the top of its 52-week range. Those are two reasons MSFT stock hasn’t climbed even after delivering stellar earnings. However, the Microsoft and OpenAI reset is another reason investors are bullish on MSFT stock .Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:df1494a59094b:0-microsoft-and-openai-just-hit-reset-here-s-why-msft-stock-wins/

Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down 20% Before Earnings for AI Growth?,1747915200000,"Salesforce ( CRM )  stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM’s slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28. The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service. CRM’s growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce’s offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over—its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce’s transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft (MSFT) and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM’s Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce’s new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program “agents” for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development. Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said “nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,” and all of its “top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.”The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, “achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation.” The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce’s AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce’s earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Likely to Influence Salesforce’s Q1 ResultsSalesforce appears well-positioned to report strong first-quarter results, driven by its strategic focus on digital transformation and cloud solutions. With businesses globally undergoing digital overhauls, Salesforce's commitment to aligning its product offerings with customer needs is likely to have boosted its revenues for the quarter.The growing demand for generative AI-enabled cloud solutions has been a major catalyst for Salesforce. By embedding generative AI tools across its products, the company not only enhances customer engagement but also strengthens its competitive position in the customer relationship management space. This forward-thinking approach might have significantly contributed to its top-line growth during the to-be-reported quarter.Salesforce’s ability to deepen relationships with leading brands across industries and expand its reach in key geographic markets remains a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company’s increasing footprint in the public sector is likely to have provided a further boost, unlocking new growth opportunities during the first quarter.The acquisitions of Spiff, Own and Zoomin have been pivotal in enhancing Salesforce's capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. These additions are likely to have driven higher subscription revenues, particularly across its core cloud services. Salesforce’s key cloud offerings, including Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data, are expected to have delivered robust growth.Our first-quarter revenue estimates for Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data cloud services are pegged at $2.14 billion, $2.34 billion, $1.84 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. We expect revenues of approximately $9.21 billion and $518.8 million for the Subscription and Support segment and the Professional Services division, respectively.The ongoing cost restructuring initiative is likely to have boosted Salesforce’s profitability in the first quarter. The company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 33.1%, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of cost restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.CRM’s Price Performance & ValuationOver the past year, Salesforce shares have risen 1.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry’s growth of 10.4%. Compared to its peers, CRM stock has also underperformed other enterprise software makers, including SAP SE SAP, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT. Over the past year, shares of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have gained 53.1%, 26.7% and 6%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value Salesforce offers investors at the current levels. CRM stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.48X compared with the industry’s 9.25X.CRM stock also trades at a discounted multiple compared with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/S multiples of 8.38X, 6.77X and 10.87X, respectively.Investment Thesis for Salesforce StockSalesforce is the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management industry, consistently outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Gartner’s annual rankings reaffirm its top position year after year. Its ability to maintain this dominance stems from its expansive product suite, seamless integrations and innovative approach to enterprise solutions.Strategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in strengthening its market position. The $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack in 2021 significantly enhanced its collaboration capabilities, making Salesforce a comprehensive enterprise software provider. More recently, the $1.9-billion acquisition of Own Company in 2024 bolstered its data protection and AI capabilities, a move that aligns with growing enterprise priorities around security and automation.Salesforce’s AI initiatives further cement its leadership. Since introducing Einstein GPT in March 2023, the company has expanded its AI-driven functionalities across its entire ecosystem. This technology enhances automation, streamlines workflows and improves customer interactions, giving Salesforce a significant advantage as AI adoption accelerates across industries.Additionally, Salesforce is positioned to benefit from the continued rise in worldwide IT spending. Gartner projects global IT spending to reach $5.61 trillion in 2025, implying a 9.8% year-over-year increase. Enterprise software spending is expected to grow even faster, rising 14.2% year over year. As digital transformation remains a top priority for businesses, Salesforce is well-positioned to capture a substantial share of these increasing budgets.Conclusion: Hold CRM Stock Ahead of Q1 ResultsThe company’s leadership in customer relationship management, aggressive AI expansion and increasing enterprise IT spending trends create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Its ability to deliver earnings growth despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties makes the stock worth holding.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7c0b962d1094b:0-salesforce-gears-up-to-post-q1-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/
3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Stock Market News for May 22, 2025",1747909440000,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday following spike in yields of long-dated U.S. sovereign bonds. Market participants remained concerned that the proposed tax-cut bill of President Trump will further worsen U.S. fiscal deficit. The U.S.-China tariff war also remained unresolved. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 1.9% or 816.80 points to close at 41,860.44. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and one finished in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 18,872.64, sliding 1.4% due to weak performance of technology bigwigs. Technology giants like Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) decreased 2%, 2.1%, 2.3% and 2.7%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 15.4% to 20.87. A total of 19.39 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 17.34 billion. The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities. As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February. Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:747eff640094b:0-stock-market-news-for-may-22-2025/

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a0f366036094b:0-should-you-stay-invested-in-or-sell-coreweave-stock-post-q1-earnings/

Microsoft hosts developer conference as focus grows on AI profits,1747648800000,"Microsoft hosts its annual software developer conference in Seattle on Monday, drawing thousands of coders looking to turn the past years of investments into artificial intelligence into profitable products and services for consumers and businesses.The Redmond, Washington-based software giant, which is an investor and deep strategic partner with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and has already spent $64 billion this year, much of it on data centers needed for AI-based services such as Copilot used in its popular Microsoft 365 applications.But there are signs that Microsoft — whose shares are up more than 30% this year, defying a broader Nasdaq decline — is reworking its relationship with OpenAI and seeking to become a neutral arms dealer in the AI race.Earlier this year, Microsoft allowed OpenAI to branch out and work with Oracle on the massive ""Stargate"" data center project in Texas.Meanwhile, CEO Satya Nadella has argued the company can get expenses down, saying that once it settles on an algorithm and begins to optimize it, Microsoft can obtain 10 times better performance for the same computing costs.Demand for AI services in Microsoft's Azure cloud computing is also continuing to grow.Thomas Blakey, an equity analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said that the company is increasingly keeping revenue-generating AI services inside its own data centers, where it can continue to tweak them for better cost. It shifting to only using outside data center services such as CoreWeave, which is known as a ""neocloud"" that focuses on offering AI chips from Nvidia, when Microsoft needs short bursts of extra computing power for specific projects.""If they have to flex up in some way, they've been consistently saying that they're going to shift away from buying more data centers and dirt and cement and they're going to leave that to the neoclouds,"" Blakey told Reuters.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0TP:0-microsoft-hosts-developer-conference-as-focus-grows-on-ai-profits/"

Microsoft Could Rally as EU Antitrust Case Nears Resolution,1747855440000,"It didn’t really need much boosting, but Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT stock got more good news in a week when the market is looking for direction. The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union’s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its  market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a “clear and complete resolution” to its rivals’ concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft’s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it’s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it’s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That’s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it’s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it’s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft’s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft’s productivity applications.That’s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a “walled garden” effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company’s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock’s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock’s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average. Also, Microsoft’s estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11.35% is below its three-year average of 15.9%. From a technical standpoint, the move lower on May 21 dropped the stock below its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages, which may be a sign that a reversal is in place.While short-term volatility exists, Microsoft's strong fundamentals and market position suggest a favorable outlook for investors. Analysts continue to bid the stock higher. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give MSFT stock a Moderate Buy rating with a $512.63 price target that marks a 13% upside from its price on May 21.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:59be14231094b:0-microsoft-could-rally-as-eu-antitrust-case-nears-resolution/

Microsoft wants AI 'agents' to work together and remember things,1747615626000,"Microsoft envisions a future where any company's artificial intelligence agents can work together with agents from other firms and have better memories of their interactions, its chief technologist said on Sunday ahead of the company's annual software developer conference.Microsoft is holding its Build conference in Seattle on May 19, where analysts expect the company to unveil its latest tools for developers building AI systems.Speaking at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, ahead of the conference, Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott told reporters and analysts the company is focused on helping spur the adoption of standards across the technology industry that will let agents from different makers collaborate. Agents are AI systems that can accomplish specific tasks, such as fixing a software bug, on their own.Scott said that Microsoft is backing a technology called Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source protocol introduced by Google-backed Anthropic. Scott said MCP has the potential to create an ""agentic web"" similar to the way hypertext protocols that helped spread the internet in the 1990s.""It means that your imagination gets to drive what the agentic web becomes, not just a handful of companies that happen to see some of these problems first,"" Scott said.Scott also said that Microsoft is trying to help AI agents have better memories of things that users have asked them to do, noting that, so far, ""most of what we're building feels very transactional.""But making an AI agent's memory better costs a lot of money because it requires more computing power. Microsoft is focusing on a new approach called structured retrieval augmentation, where an agent extracts short bits of each turn in a conversation with a user, creating a roadmap to what was discussed.""This is a core part of how you train a biological brain - you don't brute force everything in your head every time you need to solve a particular problem,"" Scott said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RQ06N:0-microsoft-wants-ai-agents-to-work-together-and-remember-things/"

Earlier this year, Nvidia unveiled a new line of graphics chips at the CES show in Las Vegas.But Nvidia has grown beyond its roots as a video game graphics chip maker into the dominant producer of chips that have powered the AI frenzy that has gripped the tech industry since ChatGPT's launch in 2022.Nvidia has been designing central processing units (CPUs) that would run Microsoft's NASDAQ:MSFT Windows operating system and use technology from Arm Holdings NASDAQ:ARM , Reuters has previously reported.At Computex last year, Huang sparked ""Jensanity"" in Taiwan, as the public and media breathlessly followed the CEO, who was mobbed by attendees at the trade show.

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Google Has Made Progress in AI. Its Challenge Is Making Products. — Barrons.com,1747848660000,"By Adam LevineThis article is from the free weekly Barron's Tech email newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox.Burying the Lead. At Google I/O, the search giant's annual developers conference, Alphabet-unit Google unveiled its answer to new AI search engines like Perplexity and ChatGPT, which are nipping at its heels. But Google Search's new ""AI Mode"" was buried beneath a blizzard of other announcements, some more important than others.Let's sort through it.Grinding Its Way to AI Relevance. Despite a decade of heavy investment into AI, Google wound up racing from behind when OpenAI's ChatGPT leapfrogged it in November 2022. While we still await some of the most advanced products that were announced at I/O, Google's underlying AI technology seems to be catching up through heavy investment and rapid iteration.Handicapped. AI Mode is an important step in Google's battle to stave off new competition from AI search engines. It pairs the benefits of AI with the power of Google Search's unparalleled web index. But the implementation shows how the search giant is handicapped in this battle.Accessing AI Mode requires an extra click, which will likely reduce usage. In designing the new interface element, Google had to be careful not to break the search experience that users know so well — type and hit return. Perplexity and ChatGPT don't have a legacy interface to serve, and they can make the AI search experience more natural.Making AI Is Hard, but It's Easier Than Making Products. AI announcements at I/O included AI Mode, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini Live, Gemini in Chrome, Veo 3, Imagen 4, Flow, Beam, Canvas, Agent Mode, and that doesn't include experimental products like Project Aura and Project Astra.Without looking it up, can anyone tell me what all these things do, and why I should use them? The product branding feels removed from the use case, potentially leading to customer confusion.This gets back to Google's longtime problem with turning tech into products. As tracked by the website KilledByGoogle.com, Google has shut down 296 products over the years. It has had 13 messaging apps, four of which are still going.Google's challenge is bringing all these strands together in a way that makes a simple pitch to users, the same way Search did in 1997.Making Agents Happen. One loud-and-clear message from both Google I/O and Microsoft's Monday Build conference is that AI ""agents"" are where these companies see the future. Agents are apps that work on top of an AI language model, automating a series of tasks from simple commands. Microsoft is pitching them to its business customers, while Google unveiled Agent Mode for consumer use.For Google, it's vital to maintain control of these AI personal assistants. Once let loose in a browser, these agents can go everywhere a human goes, including searching on Google. The issue is AI agents don't care about Google's advertising. At some point in the not-too-distant future, a large portion of web traffic may be AI agents. All ad-supported services, including Google Search, should find that troubling.But if Google is the one providing the agents, it can monetize them, making up for the loss of human traffic on the web.This Week in Barron's Tech- Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals.

While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share’s Price Performance Post Q1 Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ’s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ’s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ’s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions — Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq’s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella’s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ’s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts’ optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%. Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ’s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ’s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors. Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ’s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company’s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ’s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption. The recent 21% increase in share price following first-quarter 2025 earnings is more than just momentum; it reflects meaningful strategic progress.The $22-million commercial deal with EPB, expanding government partnerships like DARPA’s benchmarking initiative, and acquisitions that bolster capabilities in quantum internet infrastructure all underscore IonQ’s leadership in a rapidly evolving space.Despite high R&D expenses and integration risks, IonQ’s nearly $700 million cash position provides the financial flexibility to pursue innovation aggressively without compromising its long-term vision. While the stock’s valuation is lofty, the narrowing consensus loss estimates and reaffirmed guidance signal growing confidence in execution.For long-term investors willing to embrace volatility, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a company building the foundation of next-generation computing and secure communications.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:440e7a061094b:0-ionq-stock-jumps-21-following-q1-earnings-results-still-a-buy/
Sovereign AI Is the Next Big Trend in Tech. What It Means. — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore ""sovereign AI"" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.""National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. ""People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.""Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion ""Project Transcendence,"" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.""Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,"" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/

"David Tepper's Appaloosa Sells FedEx Stock, Alters Mag 7 Holdings — Barrons.com",1747426800000,"Al RootHedge funds are filing their required quarterly portfolio disclosures, a focus for investors who want to know what the "" smart money"" is doing.Appaloosa Management qualifies as smart money. It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%. Appaloosa might have taken profits in the latter and not see a turnaround coming for the former.

OpenAI's $3 Billion Power Play Could Upend the Future of Coding,1747422130000,"OpenAI is making a serious play for the future of software development. The company just launched Codex, a new AI agent built to write features, squash bugs, and run testsall within ChatGPT. Available first to paying users on Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans, Codex is powered by a customized version of OpenAI's o3 model, fine-tuned for engineering tasks. It's still early days, and the tool isn't fully autonomous yetbut OpenAI staff are already using it daily, and external testers like Cisco and Kodiak Robotics have jumped in to explore use cases ranging from automation to prototyping.The bigger story? OpenAI could be preparing to buy Windsurf, a fast-growing startup in the AI coding space, for about $3 billionpotentially the company's largest acquisition to date. That would put OpenAI in direct competition with Google NASDAQ:GOOG , Anthropic, and Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed GitHub, all of which are racing to build the best AI copilots for developers. Startups like Cursor-maker Anysphere are also drawing investor interest with tools that suggest code based on a developer's intent, and Windsurf sits right in the middle of that action. If the deal goes through, OpenAI wouldn't just be scaling Codexit could be buying its way into developer mindshare.Under the hood, Codex is being framed as a stepping stone toward full-blown AI agentssystems that can handle complex workflows with minimal human direction. Depending on the task, Codex might take anywhere from a minute to half an hour to complete a job, and OpenAI says it's seeing rapid improvement in the model's reasoning capabilities. Importantly, Codex was also trained to flag and reject malicious requests, addressing concerns around AI-generated malware. For now, OpenAI seems to be testing both the product and the market. But with billions on the table and demand growing fast, this could be a critical chapter in the arms race to own the future of AI-powered development.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:0b31af19e094b:0-openai-s-3-billion-power-play-could-upend-the-future-of-coding/
