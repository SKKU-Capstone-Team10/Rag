Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Amazon.com is sued over alleged sale of contaminated rice,1748024869000,"Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN was sued on Friday by consumers over its alleged sale of a wide variety of rice contaminated by arsenic and other ""heavy metals.""The proposed class action in Seattle federal court covers 18 types of rice sold through Amazon, including from familiar brands such as Ben's Original and Amazon-owned Whole Foods' 365.""Amazon sold these rice products with alarmingly high levels of heavy metals to an intended consumer audience that includes children, with no warning whatsoever about the dangers of heavy metals,"" the complaint said.The lawsuit followed a study last week by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, a nonprofit that focuses on babies' exposure to toxic chemicals.That study found arsenic in all 145 rice samples purchased nationwide, with 28% exceeding a U.S. Food and Drug Administration limit for infant rice cereal.It also found cadmium in all but one sample, and lead and mercury in more than one-third of tested samples.Amazon, based in Seattle, had no immediate comment.Exposure to heavy metals has been associated with negative health effects such as nervous system problems, immune system suppression and kidney damage, and autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children.The 18 rice products include two from Ben's Original and three with the 365 label.Plaintiffs Ashley Wright and Merriman Blum said they would not have bought or would have paid less for Iberia Basmati 100% Aged Original rice, one of the products, if they knew the rice was contaminated or Amazon never tested it for heavy metals.Friday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million for Amazon's alleged violations of Washington state consumer protection laws.Makers of baby food and dark chocolate have also faced many consumer lawsuits over the alleged presence of heavy metals.The case is Wright et al v Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 25-00977.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RV0QS:0-amazon-com-is-sued-over-alleged-sale-of-contaminated-rice/"

"Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square bets on Amazon, exits Canadian Pacific",1747949371000,"Billionaire investor Bill Ackman told clients on Thursday that his hedge fund bought Amazon shares last month, betting earnings will continue to grow at the online retailer as President Donald Trump's tariffs bite less than consumers initially feared.Ackman and his investment team updated clients on additions to the portfolio at his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management.

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Consumer Stocks Have Taken It on the Chin. Buy These 8. — Barrons.com,1747936800000,"By Jacob SonenshineConsumer stocks are down, but not out. A handful look like buys now.The latest blow came on Wednesday when bond yields popped — and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund and the SPDR S&P Retail Exchange-Traded Fund fell 2% and 3.1%, respectively. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%. Higher yields make borrowing money more expensive, which reduces consumer spending.Both funds had been on a rough stretch before Wednesday because of Wall Street's unease about the consumer companies' earnings. The higher bond yields are making investor sentiment worse, after what's been a steep drop in consumer confidence because of tariffs, which make good and services more expensive. For the year, the broader consumer discretionary ETF is off 4.5% and the retail ETF is down 5.4%. The S&P 500 has dropped only 0.5%.The silver lining is that there are select stocks that not only trade at cheaper prices now, but are also positioned for high earnings growth. Buying them right now makes sense.Citi strategist Scott Chronert looked for the ones to scoop up. He screened for consumer companies with sales that are relatively less sensitive to changes in broader economic activity, and have invested heavily in their businesses to spark high growth.Chronert started with 280 consumer stocks. He had two criteria for companies: sales less correlated to gross domestic product activity in recent years and capital expenditures that represent a relatively large ratio to annual depreciation expense. The second criteria is important because, as long-term assets depreciate, companies that are replacing those assets — and adding more — are signaling that they're prepared for ever-higher demand because they're aggressively growing.Names on the screen are Amazon.com, Costco, Tractor Supply, Procter & Gamble, Kroger, and Domino's Pizza.Another is Walmart. It's a rare retailer whose total sales aren't so sensitive to changes in consumer demand because the majority of its sales come from groceries.The discount chain has plenty of growth potential: Its total capital expenditures in the past five years, including analysts' estimates for this year, are $95 billion, about 1.6 times total depreciation expense in that period. So for every dollar of asset value lost, Walmart invests more than a dollar to increase its asset base. It's beefing up its capabilities for buy-online-pickup-in-store, e-commerce, and advertising.The idea is to add revenue streams and gradually take business from other retail outlets. That's why, after sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter, analysts expect just over 4% sales growth annually over the next three years to $768 billion, according to FactSet. That's nothing to scoff at for an already-large retailer that's outperforming other retailers. Target, for example, saw sales decline in the first quarter.Walmart's sales growth can nudge profit margins higher, which analysts forecast. If it needs to raise prices it can, though most of the growth in the first quarter came from more purchases rather than higher prices. As the advertising business ramps up, it can contribute to higher margins since the ad business generally has lower costs versus retail.Plus, Walmart is buying back stock every quarter, helping push analysts' EPS growth projections close to 10% annually.That can bring the stock higher, assuming shares aren't priced too expensively. They trade at what appears on the surface to be an expensive just over 35 times expected earnings for the coming 12 months. But at just over twice the retail fund's 14.8 times, it's about in line with the type of premium it has tended to fetch over the past couple of years, given its consistent earnings and growth trajectory.Walmart is a textbook example of a winning consumer stock right now. So are the other seven.Just remember: Consumer stocks aren't all the same. Take a look at a company's potential before you walk away.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

It also announced another AI model Claude Sonnet 4, Opus's smaller and more cost-effective cousin.Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger called the release a milestone in Anthropic's work to make increasingly autonomous AI. He said in an interview with Reuters that customer Rakuten had Opus 4 coding for nearly seven hours, while an Anthropic researcher set up the AI model to play 24 hours of a Pokemon game. That's up from about 45 minutes of game play for its prior model Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic told MIT Technology Review.""For AI to really have the economic and productivity impact that I think it can have, the models do need to be able to work autonomously and work coherently for that (longer) amount of time,"" he said.The news follows a flurry of other AI announcements this week, including from Google, with which Anthropic also competes.

"Should You Buy, Hold or Sell OKTA Stock Before Q1 Earnings Release?",1747930320000,"Okta OKTA is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 27.For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, Okta anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of 76-77 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

Nordstrom Stock Just Delisted. Macy's and Dillard's Are the Department Stores Left Standing. — Barrons.com,1747855320000,"By Teresa RivasAnd then there were two.Macy's and Dillard's are the only publicly traded traditional, mall-based department stores now that Nordstrom's has gone private.JWN is no more. After years of will-they-or-won't-they speculation and failed deals, the Nordstrom family finally found a buyer for their Seattle-based retail chain — and the stock was delisted on Wednesday.The acquisition, announced near the end of last year, is an all-cash acquisition priced at $24.25 a share in partnership with Mexican department store operator El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. The Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company and Liverpool will own the other 49.9%.The Nordstrom family had owned about a third of Nordstrom's shares outstanding and Liverpool had owned approximately 10%. The deal, which shareholders signed off on earlier this month, includes a special dividend of 25 cents.That's a far cry from the $50 per-share offer the family had made in 2018. Then again, the retail landscape has essentially been transformed. One of the few constants is the incredibly shrinking footprint of the department store.Today, just Macy's and Dillard's are the stocks for those who want to invest in the true traditional department store.Once a mainstay of American retail, department stores were KO'd by e-commerce and discounters like TJ Maxx and Marshalls.Most went down for the count — remember Barney's? — though a few of the old names got back up but are beyond dazed. J.C. Penney and Sears operate a handful of stores postbankruptcy, and Lord and Taylor and Mervyns live online only.So it's up to Macy's and Dillard's to carry on the fight.Macy's has never retaken its 2015 all-time high. The stock is down about 40% in the past year, leaving it with a market cap of $3.3 billion. An accounting error that paid executives too much didn't help. Only 14 analysts tracked by FactSet still cover the stockand 70% of them rate it at Hold or the equivalent.Dillard's, with a market cap of $6.4 billion, actually has a stronger punch. True, only four analysts track the stock and not one is bullish on it. But the stock has defied the naysayers, hitting all-time highs earlier this year. The company's one-two combo of cost discipline and focus on higher-margin categories is allowing it to deliver a string of better-than-expected results.Kohl's is sometimes counted as department-store stock. However, the company has always favored off-mall locations. For a time, that strategy, along with partnering with Amazon.com to accept its returns, allowed it to outperform other department stores.In the past year, though, stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value — hurt by the firing of its CEO and disappointing results. The company lost a chance to be acquired for more than $60 a share in 2022, and now changes hands for $8.Life for department stores is rough — and has been for the past decade. Maybe even longer. The American shopper wants to buy online and get rock-bottom prices, which explains the rise of the discounter.Even catering to the well-to-to hasn't shielded those great retailers, as evidenced by companies like Neiman Marcus and Henri Bendel.So Macy's and Dillard's are left to go it alone. Nordstrom keep getting jabbed at by shifting tastes and tariffs and online stores — both here and abroad — but at the least it won't have to share the details of that fight every quarter.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Amazon vs. Oracle: Which Cloud Computing Stock is a Better Bet?,1747834920000,"In the high-stakes world of cloud computing, Amazon.com AMZN and Oracle ORCL represent contrasting approaches to capturing the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and enterprise computing. Amazon, with its dominant Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud platform, continues to leverage its first-mover advantage and massive scale, while Oracle positions itself as a specialized provider of database and enterprise applications with growing cloud ambitions through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.Both tech giants have made significant investments in AI infrastructure and services, attempting to capitalize on the transformative technology that's reshaping industries worldwide. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for AMZN StockAmazon's cloud division, AWS, delivered impressive first-quarter 2025 results with revenues climbing 17% year over year to $29.3 billion, establishing an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. This robust performance demonstrates AWS' continued market leadership despite increasing competition. Amazon's aggressive expansion of AI capabilities, including the deployment of next-generation P6-B200 instances powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, positions the company at the forefront of the AI revolution.The company's retail business also shows remarkable resilience with record delivery speeds and strong consumer engagement. Amazon has successfully regionalized its fulfillment network, resulting in faster deliveries and lower costs. According to CEO Andy Jassy, everyday essentials grew twice as fast as the rest of the business and represented one out of every three units sold in the United States.Amazon's strategic investments extend beyond domestic markets. The company recently announced a $5+ billion partnership with Saudi Arabia's HUMAIN to build a groundbreaking ""AI Zone,"" demonstrating its global ambitions. Additionally, Amazon has rapidly expanded its AI model offerings in Bedrock, incorporating leading models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek, creating a comprehensive AI ecosystem for developers and enterprises.The company's financial health is equally impressive, with first-quarter operating income growing 20% year over year to $18.4 billion. Amazon beat Wall Street expectations with EPS of $1.59, exceeding forecasts by 23 cents. The company's diversified revenue streams, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and subscription services, provide multiple growth vectors and natural hedges against market volatility.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 net sales is pegged at $693.74 billion, indicating growth of 8.74% from the prior-year reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.3 per share, which indicates a jump of 13.92% from the year-ago period.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for ORCL StockOracle's recent performance has failed to impress investors, with third-quarter 2025 results falling short of expectations. Revenues reached $14.13 billion, growing just 6.40% year over year but missing projections by $259.18 million. Similarly, EPS of $1.47 missed estimates by 2 cents, reflecting execution challenges in a highly competitive market.While Oracle touts its cloud growth, the reality remains that its total cloud revenues of $6.2 billion are dwarfed by AWS' $29.3 billion quarterly revenues. Oracle's infrastructure scale limitations are evident as the company struggles to meet demand, with executives repeatedly citing ""capacity constraints"" as hurdles to faster growth. Despite adding its 101st cloud region, Oracle lacks the global reach and availability zones that Amazon offers.The company's strategic focus appears scattered across multiple fronts — healthcare partnerships, financial services products, and government initiatives — without the coherent vision that Amazon demonstrates. Oracle's heavy reliance on its database business makes it vulnerable to cloud-native alternatives and multi-cloud strategies that bypass Oracle's traditionally high-margin offerings.Though Oracle highlights its Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) growing 63% to $130 billion, skepticism exists around conversion rates and timing. The company's guidance for 15% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 seems ambitious given its consistent execution issues and history of overpromising. Oracle's AI strategy centers around its database offerings rather than providing the comprehensive AI ecosystem that AWS delivers.The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.3% over the past 60 days.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteDespite management's claims about cost advantages for AI workloads, Oracle lacks the semiconductor investments and specialized infrastructure that Amazon has built. The company's relatively modest $16 billion annual CapEx pales in comparison to Amazon's infrastructure investments, raising questions about Oracle's ability to compete at scale in the capital-intensive cloud and AI markets.Stock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonBoth companies trade at premium valuations, but Amazon offers superior value considering its growth prospects. Amazon's forward P/E of approximately 30.66x is justified by its diversified revenue streams, market leadership in multiple high-growth sectors, and consistent ability to exceed earnings expectations. Oracle's forward P/E of 24.2x appears superficially cheaper but represents a questionable value given its slower growth and execution challenges.AMZN vs. ORCL: P/E F12M RatioAmazon's recent price performance reflects investor confidence, with shares climbing 3.5% year in the past 6-month period, outperforming Oracle which declined 16.6%. Oracle's relative valuation discount reflects legitimate concerns about its competitive position and ability to capitalize on the AI revolution at scale.AMZN Outperforms ORCL in the Past 6-Month PeriodAmazon's enterprise value to free cash flow ratio provides a more compelling investment case, especially considering the company's proven ability to reinvest cash flows into high-return initiatives. While both companies offer cloud exposure, Amazon's diversification and scale provide a significantly more attractive risk-adjusted return profile than Oracle's narrower focus and smaller operational footprint.ConclusionAmazon emerges as the decidedly stronger investment opportunity in the cloud and AI race. Its superior scale, comprehensive AI capabilities, diversified revenue streams, and consistent execution provide a compelling foundation for long-term growth. While Oracle attempts to position itself as a specialized alternative, its smaller scale, execution missteps, and fragmented strategy make it a distant second in the cloud wars. Investors seeking exposure to the transformative potential of cloud computing and artificial intelligence would be better served by adding Amazon shares to their portfolios while reducing or avoiding Oracle positions. Amazon's demonstrated ability to continuously reinvent itself and its leadership position in multiple high-growth markets give it unmatched potential for sustained outperformance. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), whereas ORCL has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c981bb8e7094b:0-amazon-vs-oracle-which-cloud-computing-stock-is-a-better-bet/

UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

C3.ai Trading at a Premium at 6.39X: Time to Hold or Sell the Stock?,1747760040000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector’s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai’s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels. C3.ai currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:97dfa7506094b:0-c3-ai-trading-at-a-premium-at-6-39x-time-to-hold-or-sell-the-stock/
Criteo Stock Plunges 29% YTD: Should You Buy the Dip or Wait?,1747753140000,"Criteo CRTO shares have lost 29.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 1.4% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 0.7%. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry’s growth of 17.2% in the same time frame.The stock’s underperformance can be attributed to the effect of tariffs and inflation surrounding the industry. Criteo, although showing a dip at the moment, is poised for long-term growth even amid the macroeconomic uncertainties. The company is taking strategic steps to drive its prospects. Let’s take a closer look at how CRTO is laying the foundation for sustained growth.Strategic Shifts to Reinforce Retail Media and MonetizationCriteo has been transitioning from its legacy retargeting business toward high-growth areas, such as Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, Retail Media on-platform revenues grew 21% year over year, driven by increased advertiser and retailer demand. Off-platform monetization also grew, supported by a 60% increase in supply partners. This can be attributed to the company’s work with retailers like Michaels, Dollar Tree and Meijer, and its expansion of on-site monetization and self-service platforms.Commerce Audiences is another area of focus, with more than 250 brands onboarded to its expanded platform to date. With more first-party data integrations and growing demand for performance-based upper-funnel targeting, this business is positioned to scale throughout 2025.Criteo S.A. Price and ConsensusCriteo S.A. price-consensus-chart | Criteo S.A. QuoteCriteo’s Competition and How CRTO Stands OutCriteo operates in a crowded space, competing with tech giants like Amazon AMZN, Google GOOGL, and The Trade Desk TTD. Amazon uses its shopper data to sell ads directly on its platform, while The Trade Desk helps brands buy ads across the open Internet with data-driven tools. Google rivals Criteo with ads across Search, YouTube and websites, using its vast user data. Shares of Amazon, Google and The Trade Desk have lost 6%, 12.1% and 35.1%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. While these players dominate in various channels, Criteo differentiates itself by providing retailer-direct access and a transparent, demand-driven platform that aligns with first-party data needs. With its broad retail network, proprietary Shopper Graph, and AI-based performance engine, Criteo offers measurable returns to brands and retailers, an advantage it plans to expand upon through continued platform investment and innovation.CRTO’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRTO’s 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $3.46 per share, which has been revised upward by 8.46% over the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 16.98%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.41%.CRTO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 45.42%.Here’s Why You Should Buy CRTO Stock NowCriteo is now focusing on high-growth areas like Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, the company expanded its advertiser base by 11% year over year and drove strong platform adoption across key retailers like Michaels and Meijer. New features such as dynamic sponsored products and video ads have strengthened its product suite, while recent wins in categories like grocery and home improvement reflect growing market traction. With more than 250 brands using Commerce Audiences and self-service adoption rising, Criteo is building momentum. Backed by a clear product roadmap, the company is positioning itself for long-term success.CRTO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

Forget the U.S. Downgrade. Here's What Really Matters to the Market. — Barrons.com,1747691580000,"By Ian SalisburyMoody's downgrade to the U.S.'s credit rating initially shook the market as it kicked off the week.The S&P 500 was down early Monday, before recovering to finish up 0.1%, as investors reacted to the firm's recent decision to strip U.S. sovereign debt of its triple-A credit rating.While psychologically jarring, history suggests the downgrade will have little impact on stock returns in the longer term. Instead, investors should focus on corporate earnings.""The history of U.S. sovereign debt rating agency downgrades spans +10 years and uniformly shows that these actions do not portend higher rates, recession, or lower stock prices,"" wrote DataTrek analyst Nicholas Colas in a note Monday. ""Over the last 20 years, 10-year Treasury yields were highest when America was AAA rated by all three agencies,""Indeed, Colas noted Standard & Poor's cut its rating on U.S. debt all the way back in 2011, and Fitch did so in 2023. Neither move ultimately scared investors away from Treasury bonds, which remained capital markets ultimate safe haven. Meanwhile the S&P 500 has enjoyed one of its best stretches in recent memory.A better way to gauge where stocks are headed may simply be to focus on corporate profits. There has been cause for worry there too, noted Morgan Stanley analyst Michael J. Wilson in a Monday note, but the picture is improving. One of Wilson's preferred gauges is ""earnings revision breadth,"" a sentiment measure which compares the number of downward earnings revisions issued by Wall Street stock analysts to upward ones.While the earnings revision breadth measure is still bearish, it's improved dramatically in the past few weeks. Wilson notes that breadth for the S&P 500 is now at -15%, up from a low of -25% in mid-April. If that trend continues, the S&P 500 could approach its mid-February highs.""The combination of upside momentum in revisions breadth and last week's deal with China has placed the S&P 500 firmly back in our pre-Liberation Day range of 5500-6100,"" Wilson wrote. ""We think continued upward progress in EPS revisions breadth back toward 0% will be needed to break through 6100 on the upside.""The S&P 500 hit its all-time high of 6144 on Feb. 19Among the sectors that have enjoyed the biggest rebounds are media and entertainment, materials, capital goods and tech hardware. By contrast, laggards with worsening outlooks include consumer durables, autos and consumer services.Citi analysts, for their part, are also bearish on consumer stocks, worrying about recent signs that spending by American consumers is slowing. On Friday, the University of Michigan reported its consumer sentiment index slipped to 50.8, its second-lowest reading in more than 40 years.""We have been [underweight] consumer discretionary and staples stocks this year as the U.S. consumer has been in the crosshairs of tariff policy risk,"" analysts wrote Friday. ""A worst-case policy impact has seemingly been alleviated, yet recent signs of consumer slowing are concerning.""Citi analysis recommended investors who do want to own consumer stocks pick and choose, with an emphasis on defensive names. To that end, they ran a screen hunting for individual stocks, with low cyclicality, high debt-to-capital ratios and high capital expenditures relative to deprecation.Among the names that came up: Walmart, Dollar Tree, Amazon and Procter & Gamble.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell Snowflake Stock Before Q1 Earnings?",1747664100000,"Snowflake SNOW is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 21.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 21.13%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating 57.14% year-over-year growth.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing once, the average earnings surprise being 28.04%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

UBER vs. GRAB: Which Ride-Hailing Stock is a Stronger Play Now?,1747663860000,"Uber Technologies UBER and Grab GRAB both provide ride-hailing services. The companies have revolutionized the transportation industry with their innovative business models centered on ride-sharing.However, the companies operate in different regions and have distinct approaches. While Uber operates globally, Grab is a leading provider of deliveries, mobility and digital financial services sectors in multiple cities across eight countries in Southeast Asia — Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Even though Uber’s primary business is ride-sharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time.Given this difference in approaches and geographical focus of the two companies, let’s examine closely to find out which one currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now.The Case for UberUber is based in San Francisco, CA. Uber’s ridesharing and delivery platforms are growing in popularity. This is generating strong demand, which, along with the latest growth initiatives and continued cost discipline, is driving the company’s results.In its recently released first-quarter 2025 results, Uber continued its streak of beating earnings expectations, showing resilience despite tough conditions.Uber Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUber price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Uber QuoteIn the June quarter, gross bookings are anticipated to be in the $45.75 billion - $47.25 billion range, indicating 16-20% growth on a constant currency basis from second-quarter 2024 actuals. The guidance includes an estimated 1.5 percentage point impact of currency headwind (including a roughly 3 percentage point currency headwind to Mobility).Earnings Estimates for UberUber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. By adopting this approach, Uber has been able to avoid the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. Moreover, Uber has engaged in numerous acquisitions, geographic and product diversifications, and innovations. Its endeavors to expand into international markets are commendable and provide it with the benefits of geographical diversification.Another area of confidence is Uber’s buyback strategy. In 2024, Uber generated a record $6.9 billion in free cash flow, with an adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Uber’s announcement to start an accelerated $1.5 billion stock buyback program highlights not only its shareholder-friendly strategy but also signals confidence in its ongoing business strategy. The $1.5 billion plan is part of the company's $7 billion buyback program announced last year.In 2018, Uber, which went public in 2019, sold its business in Southeast Asia to Grab. Uber has a significant stake in Grab.The Case for GrabGrab's ability to adapt to local conditions is a key contributor to its success in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Grab’s evolution from a taxi-hailing app into an ""everyday everything app"" offering various services, including food delivery, e-scooter rentals and digital payments, is commendable and highlights its desire to expand. Grab is benefiting from strong growth in its On-Demand Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”), expanding fintech offerings, and increasing user engagement across its platform. On-demand GMV refers to the sum of GMV of the mobility and deliveries segments. In the first quarter of 2025, On-Demand GMV increased 16% year over year. Grab expects 2025 revenues between $3.33 billion and $3.40 billion, indicating 19-22% year-over-year growth. Grab Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGrab price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Grab QuoteGrab is strengthening its position across Southeast Asia by partnering with  Amazon ’s AMZN cloud computing platform — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — to drive growth in mobility, deliveries and financial services.In December 2024, Grab selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate growth across its mobility, deliveries, and financial services verticals, including its digital banks. Grab has enhanced operational efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs and launched innovative services by utilizing AWS’ scalable, secure and cost-efficient cloud solutions.Earnings Estimates for GrabGrab Appears to Be More Pricey Than UberUber is trading at a forward sales multiple of 3.58, above its median of 2.54 over the last three years. Uber has a Value Score of D. Meanwhile, Grab has a Value Score of F, with its forward sales multiple at 5.78, above its 3-year median of 4.85.ConclusionUber’s expensive valuation (compared to its 3-year median) seems to suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for this dominant player in the ride-hailing industry. The company’s diversification efforts and shareholder-friendly approach attest to its financial bliss. Uber’s large size (market capitalization of $191.95 billion) positions it well to overcome uncertain times, such as the current one.Grab, on the other hand, has a much narrower geographical focus, making it highly susceptible to economic downturns, such as the current scenario. The economic uncertainty in key Southeast Asia markets, driven by factors like inflation, changing consumer behavior, and supply-chain disruptions, is hurting Grab. Moreover, Grab faces intense competition in its deliveries segment. The much smaller Grab, with a market capitalization of $20.5 billion, is not as shareholder-friendly, as its larger rival.On the basis of our analysis, Uber seems a better pick than Grab, despite both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfb690819094b:0-uber-vs-grab-which-ride-hailing-stock-is-a-stronger-play-now/
Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month.

The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point.

Bear of the Day: United Parcel Service (UPS),1747641600000,"UPS Company OverviewBased in Atlanta, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock United Parcel Service ( UPS ) is the world’s largest express carrier and package delivery company. Founded in 1907, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. The company offers a range of supply chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions, and repairs. UPS transports millions of packages each business day across the globe. In 2024, the company delivered 22.4 million packages per day on average.UPS to Slash Amazon Business in HalfE-commerce juggernaut Amazon ( AMZN ) is UPS’s largest customer by far in terms of volume and revenue. Unfortunately for UPS, UPS Amazon deliveries are also some of the least profitable sides of the business, with tiny margins. Facing a dilemma, UPS management decided earlier this year to cut its Amazon delivery volume by more than 50% by the end of next year. While the bold move may reduce UPS’s reliance on Amazon and increase margins, it will be near-impossible to fill the gigantic volume void any time soon, leaving shareholders with more questions than answers.Weakness in Europe and Asia Persists Geopolitical uncertainty, global trade concerns, and poor consumer sentiment continue to contribute to the economic slowdown and slowing demand for UPS in Asia and Europe. With all the uncertainty, UPS forward guidance forecasts that revenue will be lower in 2025 in 2024.Unionization Means Higher CostsUPS is the largest employer of members of the “Teamsters” union. After a strike, UPS was forced to increase full-time workers’ pay significantly by $7.50 per hour. This deal has hurt the company’s profitability dramatically, and when the agreement ends in 2028, UPS is likely to have to increase pay even more or face another strike.Relative Price Weakness Versus the MarketRelative weakness is another major red flag for UPS. Year-to-date, shares are down 19.7% while the S&P 500 Index is down only 3.4%. In other words, UPS shares fell in tandem with the market but failed to recover with it.Bottom LineUPS faces significant headwinds as it navigates a complex landscape marked by a significant shift in its Amazon relationship, persistent weakness in key international markets, and increasing labor costs.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2666b3503094b:0-bear-of-the-day-united-parcel-service-ups/
'Choose France' summit brings 20 billion euros of new investment,1747635459000,"This year's ""Choose France"" business summit is set to secure 20 billion euros ($22.47 billion) of new investment, French President Emmanuel Macron said, announcing projects in defence, energy and industry as well as in artificial intelligence.Macron's personal efforts to woo international business leaders, making the Choose France summits at the opulent Palace of Versailles a must-attend for the global corporate elite, have been credited for a turnaround in past investor perceptions of France as a high-tax, rigid economy. On top of the 20 billion euros in new investments, Macron also announced some 20 billion euros worth of AI-focused projects pledged at a Paris AI summit in February.""You delivered a lot of investments in different fields: AI, telco, ... green hydrogen, and circular economy ... this is a very complete edition where 20 billion were invested, and 20 billion of AI investments as a follow-up to the summit in February,"" Macron told CEOs and entrepreneurs in Versailles. Among the pledges made ahead of the summit, U.S. logistics giant Prologis is set to invest 6.4 billion euros in four data centres in the Paris region, while London-based fintech Revolut plans to invest 1 billion euros over the next three years on expanding in France and will apply for a French banking licence.Announcements also came from the United Arab Emirates' AI-focused MGX fund and others were expected from companies ranging from Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN to Britain's Less Common Metals Limited in the rare earth sector. Portuguese company Tekever will build a drone assembly factory in the southwest, a 100 million euro investment, the Elysee said.Macron's government is under pressure to stem a wave of job cuts in industry, as upheaval fuelled by U.S. President Trump's trade policies puts further pressure on Europe's flagging economy.""We have to invest much more in AI, green tech, defense and security, especially because this is a race,"" Macron said. France has been the leading recipient of international investments in Europe for the past six years, according to EY's European Investment Monitor, an annual survey of thousands of business leaders that Macron’s advisers have seized on as evidence his cocktail of supply-side reforms has been bearing fruit.However, this year’s edition shows the number of investment projects has declined for the second consecutive year across Europe, while those in the United States rose by a fifth between 2023 and 2024, which EY said reflected the appeal of the Inflation Reduction Act subsidy package and Trump’s pro-business promises.Despite the foreign investment flows into France, Macron has failed to stop French companies from making huge investments abroad, with Sanofi’s EURONEXT:SAN plan to spend at least $20 billion to boost manufacturing in the United States angering French politicians.($1 = 0.8899 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RR04Z:0-choose-france-summit-brings-20-billion-euros-of-new-investment/"

Stephanie Link reveals her favourite retail stocks after April inflation data,1747487700000,"US retail stocks are in focus this week after the Bureau of Labour Statistics said that inflation was up slightly less-than-expected in April.Inflation data tends to be significant for retail stocks as it directly influences consumer purchasing power and overall business costs.According to Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist, a handful of the US retail stocks are particularly well-positioned to own after April’s CPI reading.Her top picks include Walmart, Amazon, and Costco.Walmart Inc NYSE:WMTWalmart missed revenue expectations in its fiscal first quarter and warned this week that it will begin raising prices in response to tariffs. The company cited increased import costs stemming from the US administration’s trade policies and indicated that consumers could start seeing the impact as early as the end of May.Still, Stephanie Link remains bullish as ever on the retail giant as a 4.5% increase in same-store sales in the US suggests “they’re crushing it.” Plus, the NYSE-listed firm is “being conservative on guidance,” she added.Link sees WMT as strongly positioned to absorb the tariffs-driven costs, thanks to its fortress of a balance sheet. On CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, she dubbed Walmart an all-weather stock as 72% of its sales come from consumables.Finally, a close to 1% dividend yield tied to WMT shares makes them all the more exciting to own in 2025.Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ:AMZNHightower’s chief investment strategist favours owning Amazon for retail exposure this year since it continues to grow its market share in eCommerce and has a strong presence globally.According to Stephanie Link, Amazon’s scale positions it well to absorb tariff-related increases in costs. This could even help insulate the multinational from rising competition from the likes of Temu and Shein.All in all, if the US economy “continues to chug along and the consumer doesn’t die,” investors will remain interested in Amazon stock in 2025, she argued in a recent interview.Note that AMZN shares are currently down more than 15% versus their year-to-date high, which makes them appealing in terms of valuation as well.Costco Wholesale Corp NASDAQ:COSTStephanie Link counts Costco stock among her top picks for 2025 as it’s exceptionally positioned to navigate an uncertain macro environment.She recommends owning COST this year for the strength of its membership model, as it’s known to drive customer loyalty that translates to consistent revenue streams.Additionally, the retail behemoth’s efficient supply chain and bulk pricing strategy help it maintain profitability even in challenging economic conditions. Like Walmart, Costco is a dividend-paying stock, currently offering a yield of 0.51%—another compelling reason to consider adding it to your portfolio.Wall Street agrees with Link on Costco stock as well, given the consensus rating currently sits at “overweight” with price targets going as high as $1,205, indicating potential upside of more than 20% from current levels.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:ae1d87a4c094b:0-stephanie-link-reveals-her-favourite-retail-stocks-after-april-inflation-data/
Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

"In a Trade War, Walmart Lacks Some of Amazon's Ammunition — Heard on the Street — WSJ",1747474200000,"By Dan GallagherTwo American retail titans are on the front lines in President Trump's trade war. Investors seem to be betting that Walmart can dodge even more bullets than Amazon.Walmart used its fiscal first-quarter report on Thursday to warn that its prices are going up as products covered by new tariffs start hitting its shelves. That marred what was otherwise considered a strong report, with revenue rising nearly 3% from the same period last year and operating earnings exceeding Wall Street's forecasts.Wall Street doesn't seem too worried. Walmart's stock sold off sharply Thursday morning but quickly recovered. It has now risen nearly 2% since reporting earnings, putting it up around 53% over the past 12 months — well ahead of other retailers and trouncing Amazon's 12% gain over the same period.That has landed Walmart — the home of ""Always Low Prices"" — a rather rich multiple of 37 times projected earnings for the next four quarters, which is 40% above its three-year average, according to FactSet data. Amazon now trades around 33 times forward earnings.Such a premium leaves Walmart very little room for error in a world where so much can go wrong. Walmart noted Thursday that more than two-thirds of the goods it sells in U.S. stores come from the U.S. ""But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on the company's earnings call.""Narrow retail margins"" are a challenge for Amazon as well. But the company has spent many years building up ancillary and adjacent businesses such as cloud computing and advertising that provide far more financial firepower.That shows in the companies' respective income statements. Amazon and Walmart commanded similar gross margins in the mid-20% range a little over a decade ago, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Walmart's has stayed in that range, while Amazon's annual gross margin has nearly doubled — hitting 49% last year.To be sure, Walmart has done a commendable job of becoming more than just an enormous physical retailer. E-commerce revenue hit $32.5 billion in the April-ending quarter, up 22% from the same period last year and now making up 20% of the company's total sales. That has allowed Walmart to follow in Amazon's footsteps and build up new, higher-margin revenue streams from subscriber fees and advertising. Bernstein analyst Zhihan Ma says Walmart is on a ""fundamentally improved"" earnings trajectory over the long term.But Amazon is much further along that path. Note that while both companies are projected to hit roughly $700 billion in revenue this year, Wall Street expects Amazon's operating income to come in around 2 1/2 times that of Walmart's at more than $77 billion for Amazon, according to FactSet estimates.And that is even after factoring in the costs of Amazon's aggressive artificial intelligence investments and the launch of its own satellite network. These businesses are also less tied to the overall retail environment than Walmart's ancillary businesses such as advertising, making them a better hedge against tariff chaos.Walmart's scale and execution give it a distinct edge over other traditional retailers in an environment of rising prices and worried consumers. But beating Amazon at its own game is still a ways off.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250517000550:0/

"The Score: UnitedHealth, Walmart, Coinbase Global and More Stocks That Moved on the Week's News — WSJ",1747430220000,"By Francesca FontanaThe Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them.UnitedHealthUnitedHealth suffered a stock meltdown this past week.The Justice Department is investigating the healthcare conglomerate — and parent of insurance giant UnitedHealthcare — for possible criminal Medicare fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.The criminal probe adds to a list of government inquiries into UnitedHealth, including antitrust investigations and a civil investigation of its Medicare billing practices that The Wall Street Journal first reported in February.UnitedHealth said it hadn't been notified by the Justice Department of the criminal investigation and stands by the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.Earlier in the week, UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 earnings financial outlook, and announced the sudden resignation of Chief Executive Andrew Witty. Witty stepped down for ""personal reasons,"" replaced by Chairman and former CEO Stephen Hemsley.UnitedHealth shares sank 18% Tuesday, and on Thursday fell 11%.Amazon.comTo the surprise of investors and businesses around the world, the U.S. and China made a deal on trade.The two countries agreed to a 90-day trade deal that slashed tariffs between the two countries and sent stocks surging — including the biggest U.S. tech stocks whose operations depend on China.Online retail giant Amazon, for one, sells many Chinese-made products. Many of Amazon's third-party sellers source their products from the country, and independent merchants warned that prices could skyrocket if tariffs continued. Some had said their businesses would cease operations.Amazon shares gained 8.1% Monday.BoeingBoeing shares gained some air on the surprise trade truce between the U.S. and China.As part of the deal to temporarily roll back tariffs, China scrapped an earlier ban on Boeing's airplanes. Beijing told Chinese airlines that they can resume taking delivery on pre-existing jet orders.The government last month told Chinese carriers they had to seek additional approval before taking delivery of Boeing aircraft they had already ordered, in effect halting deliveries to one of Boeing's biggest markets.The U.S. jet maker also benefited from the recent trade deal struck between the U.S. and the U.K., with British Airways purchasing 32 Boeing aircraft.Boeing shares gained 2.5% Tuesday.Foot LockerDick's Sporting Goods is taking over Foot Locker.In a deal announced Thursday morning, big-box retailer Dick's agreed to buy the sneaker company for roughly $2.4 billion.Dick's said it expects to operate Foot Locker as a stand-alone business unit within its portfolio and maintain the Foot Locker brands.Foot Locker's shares had slumped this year on Trump's tariff plans, which upended supply chains and costs for retailers and sneaker companies.The deal follows the recent sneaker buyout of Skechers, which agreed to sell itself for $9.4 billion to private-equity firm 3G Capital.Foot Locker shares soared 86% Thursday, while Dick's shares dropped 15%.WalmartTariff-related price hikes are coming to Walmart.While its quarterly sales were strong, the U.S. retail behemoth said that it plans to raise prices this month and early this summer. Tariffs have already driven up the prices of some of Walmart's goods — such as bananas at 54 cents a pound, up from 50 cents, according to Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey.Many companies have already announced price increases, and other retailers are likely to follow suit. Later this month, Target, Lowe's and Home Depot will report earnings and discuss their financial forecasts.Walmart didn't share a profit forecast for the current quarter, in part because the company may absorb some tariff costs to keep prices lower than competitors, Rainey said.Walmart shares dipped 0.5% Thursday.Coinbase GlobalThe largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange said it refused to pay a $20 million ransom demand from cybercriminals that stole sensitive customer data.Coinbase said the criminals bribed the company's overseas customer support agents to steal the data, which includes names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.In a regulatory filing, the company estimated that the incident could cost from $180 million to $400 million.The breach is a setback for Coinbase — which is slated to join the S&P 500 later this month — and threatens its cultivated reputation for safety. The company has largely avoided the hacks and heists suffered by many exchanges overseas.Coinbase shares fell 7.2% Thursday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Amazon.com is sued over alleged sale of contaminated rice,1748024869000,"Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN was sued on Friday by consumers over its alleged sale of a wide variety of rice contaminated by arsenic and other ""heavy metals.""The proposed class action in Seattle federal court covers 18 types of rice sold through Amazon, including from familiar brands such as Ben's Original and Amazon-owned Whole Foods' 365.""Amazon sold these rice products with alarmingly high levels of heavy metals to an intended consumer audience that includes children, with no warning whatsoever about the dangers of heavy metals,"" the complaint said.The lawsuit followed a study last week by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, a nonprofit that focuses on babies' exposure to toxic chemicals.That study found arsenic in all 145 rice samples purchased nationwide, with 28% exceeding a U.S. Food and Drug Administration limit for infant rice cereal.It also found cadmium in all but one sample, and lead and mercury in more than one-third of tested samples.Amazon, based in Seattle, had no immediate comment.Exposure to heavy metals has been associated with negative health effects such as nervous system problems, immune system suppression and kidney damage, and autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children.The 18 rice products include two from Ben's Original and three with the 365 label.Plaintiffs Ashley Wright and Merriman Blum said they would not have bought or would have paid less for Iberia Basmati 100% Aged Original rice, one of the products, if they knew the rice was contaminated or Amazon never tested it for heavy metals.Friday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million for Amazon's alleged violations of Washington state consumer protection laws.Makers of baby food and dark chocolate have also faced many consumer lawsuits over the alleged presence of heavy metals.The case is Wright et al v Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 25-00977.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RV0QS:0-amazon-com-is-sued-over-alleged-sale-of-contaminated-rice/"
Container ship owners swamped as US-China trade detente revives demand,1747424049000,"Container ship bookings for China-to-U.S. cargo have surged since the countries declared a 90-day truce on punitive tit-for-tat tariffs last weekend, operators said, spawning traffic jams at Chinese ports and factories that could take weeks to clear.U.S. importers of sneakers and sofas to construction supplies and auto parts are racing to get goods in before the deadline resets tariffs again, setting the stage for disruptions that recall the global transport quagmire during the COVID-19 pandemic.The cargo surge at major trade gateways like Shenzhen's Yantian Port, which handles more than a quarter of China's exports to the United States, has ship owners scrambling to coordinate berths and adjust vessel schedules.""The demand is so high that we can only serve customers who have made long-term contracts with us,"" a spokesperson for German container ship operator Hapag-Lloyd XETR:HLAG told Reuters. ""We have hardly enough space for spontaneous bookings."" Container-tracking software provider Vizion said average bookings for the seven days ended on Wednesday soared 277% to 21,530 20-foot equivalent units from the 5,709 TEU average for the week ended May 5.Owners of factories that make toys to holiday decor told Reuters they are booking previously frozen cargo headed to U.S. stores, including Walmart NYSE:WMT .Lalo, for example, which sells its baby furniture online and through retailers like Target NYSE:TGT and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , is among the companies that gave factories the green light to move their finished orders.""We had hundreds of thousands of units waiting to ship,"" said Lalo co-founder Michael Wieder. ""These products can now get on the water.""""Everybody is very busy from my company, at my friend's companies,"" said Richard Lee, CEO of NCL Logistics, in China's southern metropolis of Shenzhen. ""They are preparing a lot of cargo, a lot of products, to be shipped immediately from China to the U.S.""SECOND TSUNAMI?The shipping surge will translate into a rush of arrivals at U.S. West Coast ports in the coming weeks.Still, industry experts, including the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles - the busiest U.S. seaport and No. 1 for ocean shipments from China, do not foresee a COVID-level tsunami of cargo. Rather, they project a large, but manageable wave.On Thursday, the off-contract spot rate from Shanghai to Los Angeles shot up 16% from the prior week to $3,136 per 40-foot container, according to data from maritime consultancy Drewry. That is less than half than in April 2024, but could jump sharply on June 1 to about $6,000 per container if ship owners push through rate increases.In the early days of the pandemic, as now, cargo demand spikes overwhelmed factories and container ships, kinking supply chains. Shipping and retail experts said 90 days is not enough time for most factories to fill new orders. Fewer slots are available on cargo ships because vessel owners had been culling China-to-U.S. voyages and schedules. Now, ocean carriers are ""cancelling cancellations"" of sailings, Drewry said.Demand, however, is markedly different this time.Trump's second-term tariffs have weakened U.S. retail sales, homebuilding and manufacturing - key drivers of container shipments.Moreover, many U.S. companies are sitting on inventory accumulated before Trump imposed tariffs on China and other countries. And nobody knows what import duties will be when the 90-day deadline expires in August.The Trump administration confirmed to Reuters that the U.S. rate would reset to 54%, assuming no agreement is reached by the deadline.HIGH ANXIETYMany retailers are prioritizing which products to order and ship, said Jessica Dankert, vice president of supply chain for the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group, whose members include Home Depot NYSE:HD , Gap NYSE:GAP and Dollar General NYSE:DG .""It's still 30% at the end of the day,"" said Jamie Salter, CEO of Authentic Brands Group, referring to tariffs on China. Authentic Brands owns and licenses clothing brands including Reebok, Champion, and Forever 21.Some large suppliers to Detroit's Big Three automakers told Reuters that on customers' requests, they are flying in parts from China and stockpiling them.Others declined to add to inventories, saying they lacked the space and funds to do so.A Halloween goods exporter from the city of Yiwu in China, who gave her English name, Cecilia, said tariff increases have cut total orders in half this year and warned that prospective buyers are running out of time.""If you order now, you will have an anxious wait to see if it will be too late,"" she said.Jimmy Zollo, CEO at Joe and Bella, sells Chinese-made clothing for adults who have trouble dressing themselves due to arthritis, dementia or being in a wheelchair. He placed a new order with his supplier even though the 90-day window could close before he can take delivery.""We're hopeful that a new trade agreement is implemented, and the lowered tariffs do not expire,"" Zollo said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RN18D:0-container-ship-owners-swamped-as-us-china-trade-detente-revives-demand/"

White House Says It Gets More Than $200 Billion in Deals With United Arab Emirates,1747414260000,"By Kelly CloonanThe White House said it received more than $200 billion in commitments on deals with the United Arab Emirates, including a $14.5 billion order from Etihad Airways and agreements on artificial intelligence.The latest deals join a slew of technology, aircraft and defense-related agreements announced in recent days as President Trump finishes out his four-day tour of the Middle East. The deals bring the total investment agreements in the Middle East to more than $2 trillion, the White House said.As part of the latest agreements, Boeing and GE Aerospace will deliver 28 American-made Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines for Etihad Airways. The partnership will support 60,000 U.S. jobs, the White House said.The order adds to a growing backlog for the two companies, which received a $96 billion order from Qatar Airways on Wednesday after Trump's visit to Qatar.The latest deals also aim to boost American energy companies, with a partnership between Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. for expanded oil and natural gas production valued at $60 billion. The partnership will look to lower energy costs and create jobs in both countries, the White House said.RTX, meanwhile, is partnering with Emirates Global Aluminum and the UAE's Tawazun Council to boost production of gallium, a key component of defense products, days after its subsidiary received a $1 billion agreement with Qatar to expand the country's counter-drone capabilities.Qualcomm also notched further business in the region, securing partnerships with the UAE's ADIO and e& to accelerate AI adoption in the country after announcing an agreement on Tuesday to deliver AI data centers in Saudi Arabia.The deals in the United Arab Emirates come as President Trump wraps up a four-day tour in the Middle East in an effort to boost trade with the region.On Tuesday, the White House said Saudi Arabia committed to invest $600 billion in U.S. chip companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and other large technology companies like Alphabet, Oracle and Uber and energy company GE Vernova.On Wednesday, Trump continued his dealmaking pursuits, notching more than $243.5 billion in agreements with Qatar, the White House said.These are some of the notable deals inked during President Trump's Middle East visit:- Nvidia will sell about 18,000 chips and AMD will sell about $10 billion in processors to Saudi Arabia's Humain.

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold INOD Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747411920000,"Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company’s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata’s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues — highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company’s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% — demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology — each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management’s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD’s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts’ bearish sentiments about the stock. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Magnitude - Consensus Estimate TrendINOD’s Valuation Looks StretchedInnodata's current valuation seems stretched, as evidenced by its one-year forward price-to-sales ratio of 4.31 — well above the Zacks Computer – Services industry average of 1.76. This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company’s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere’s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata. With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit. While long-term prospects look strong amid rising AI spending from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, near-term risks tied to customer concentration, execution and margin pressure remain.Given the southward revision of earnings estimates and the current valuation suggesting caution for new entrants, existing shareholders should consider holding, and new investors may wait for further validation of revenue diversification and pipeline conversion before adding to positions.INOD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

BigBear.ai Stock 65% Below Its 52-Week High: Buy the Dip or Stay Away?,1747405620000,"BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI stock has had a rough ride in 2025, declining 18.2% year to date, underperforming both the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which is down 5.2%, and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector, which has dipped 1.3%. As a result, BBAI now trades nearly 65% below its 52-week high of $10.36 and hovers close to its 52-week low of $1.17.BBAI YTD Share Price PerformanceAs a focused artificial intelligence (AI) company, BigBear.ai offers decision intelligence solutions that aim to help organizations make more informed, data-driven decisions. Despite the long-term promise of AI and continued enterprise investment in the space, BBAI faces near-term headwinds. Market volatility in early 2025 has weighed heavily on speculative tech names, especially those still operating at a loss.In its recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, BigBear.ai posted revenues of $34.8 million, marking a 5% increase from a year ago, but missing analyst expectations by 3.2%. The company recorded an adjusted loss of 10 cents per share, which was wider than the consensus estimate of a 6-cent loss per share. Adjusted EBITDA also deteriorated, falling to a loss of $7 million from a $1.6 million loss last year. This was largely driven by increased R&D spending and ongoing SG&A expenses amid government funding delays. On a GAAP basis, the net loss narrowed significantly to $62 million from $127.8 million a year earlier, though the figure remained impacted by non-cash charges such as derivative losses and stock-based compensation.As investors weigh on the company’s potential in the AI space against its financial losses and operational uncertainties, the key question remains: Is this recent weakness a buying opportunity, or does more downside risk lie ahead for BigBear.ai?What’s Hurting BigBear.ai Stock’s Performance?Profitability Pressured by Delays & Increased Investment : Despite its positioning, BigBear.ai continues to face meaningful headwinds. Revenue remains ""lumpy,"" driven by the timing of government contracts and milestone achievements. The company acknowledged procurement and funding delays due to shifts in federal efficiency mandates—an issue that may persist through the mid-year.Furthermore, increased R&D expenses, which jumped $3 million year over year in the first quarter, and elevated SG&A from underutilized capacity weighed on margins and operating performance. Recurring SG&A rose to $17.7 million from $13.6 million, partly due to the full-quarter impact of the Pangiam acquisition and continued spending to support unutilized resources caused by government funding delays. Adjusted gross margin declined slightly to 28.6%, and EBITDA losses widened, indicating near-term scalability challenges.Another ongoing concern is the high degree of non-cash financial activity, including $2.6 million in debt extinguishment losses and growing stock-based compensation, which affects bottom-line optics.Persistent Challenges in Cost Control and Revenue Recognition Timing : Several structural challenges persist. Elevated operating expenses, especially from hiring and system integration, are weighing heavily on margins. The company cited delays in government funding as a reason for excess staffing costs and underutilized capacity, a scenario that may repeat if fiscal uncertainties continue.Moreover, a $33 million increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities, primarily due to warrant revaluations and note conversions, contributed to increased volatility in reported results. While these are non-cash items, they significantly impact bottom-line perception and investor sentiment.The lack of visibility around contract timing and the company’s exposure to federal budget cycles remain material risks, particularly given BigBear.ai’s heavy reliance on public sector clients.Can the BigBear.ai Stock Stage a Comeback?Strategic Contracts and AI Expansion : A cornerstone of BigBear.ai’s first-quarter traction was the award of a significant contract to deliver and maintain the Department of Defense Joint Staff J35’s Orion Decision Support Platform. This contract is notable not just for its size but also for its strategic relevance, as it affirms BigBear’s capability to meet high-level defense analytics and decision-making needs.Additionally, the company deepened relationships in sectors such as shipbuilding and logistics, with expanded work for clients like Austal USA. These engagements showcase how BigBear is leveraging its analytics suite to improve operational efficiency and supply chain visibility in strategically vital industries. Such wins are a testament to the company’s dual strengths — technical AI sophistication and domain-specific expertise.Internationally, partnerships such as the one with Smith Detection on prohibited item detection are helping the company penetrate global security markets.BigBear.ai is steadily expanding its footprint through strategic alliances with leading technology firms, reinforcing the credibility and utility of its AI-driven solutions. Major players like Amazon AMZN, Palantir PLTR, and Autodesk ADSK have integrated BigBear.ai’s technologies into their ecosystems, showcasing growing enterprise adoption.Amazon Web Services (AWS) has embedded BigBear.ai’s ProModel solution into AWS ProServe, leveraging its predictive modeling and real-time analytics to optimize logistics and warehouse operations. In the defense and intelligence space, Palantir has teamed up with BigBear.ai to strengthen its AI capabilities, underscoring the relevance of BBAI’s solutions in high-stakes environments. Additionally, Autodesk is utilizing BigBear.ai’s technology to enhance its design and engineering platforms, highlighting applications in industrial automation and complex system simulation.This momentum aligns with the company’s dual-pronged 2025 strategy—fortifying its core U.S. defense and government tech markets while branching out into commercial and international verticals. CEO Kevin McAleenan emphasized a mission-driven innovation model that blends advanced AI with operational understanding, giving the company an edge in domains like border security and supply chain intelligence.Innovation-Focused Product Portfolio Gains Traction : The company’s broad and expanding portfolio of AI products also served as a key driver. Platforms like Pangiam Threat Detection, ProModel AI, ConductorOS, and Shipyard.ai are designed to solve complex logistics, analytics, and decision-making challenges across both government and commercial sectors. Some of these products, particularly veriScan and Trueface, contributed directly to revenue gains this quarter.Importantly, several R&D projects have now transitioned into general availability, which could enhance monetization and adoption rates going forward. This shift from pure R&D to deployable solutions underscores BigBear.ai’s ability to commercialize innovation and move up the technology maturity curve.Estimates Show Bearish Trend for BBAI StockThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share is pegged at 41 cents, which has widened from 21 cents in the past 30 days. Yet, the estimated figure indicates a narrower loss from a loss of $1.10 per share a year ago.BBAI Stock’s ValuationIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales (P/S), BBAI is trading at 6.07X, higher than its three-year median of 1.90X but lower than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.17X. BBAI currently has a Value Score of F.How to Play BBAI Stock Now?Despite BigBear.ai's promising strategic alliances and expanding AI product portfolio, the near-term outlook remains challenged by weak financial performance, lack of profitability, and structural risks. The company’s wider-than-expected first-quarter losses, deteriorating EBITDA, and contracting gross margins point to scalability issues amid persistent delays in government funding. Operational inefficiencies, including elevated SG&A and underutilized capacity, have significantly pressured margins, while non-cash derivative losses and stock-based compensation further distort true profitability.With revenue growth falling short and cost controls still elusive, the path to sustainable earnings remains uncertain. The stock’s 65% plunge from its 52-week high, combined with a bearish shift in 2025 earnings estimates, suggests sentiment may worsen before stabilizing. Valuation also appears stretched relative to its historical average, with a high forward P/S and an unfavorable Value Score of F. Until BigBear.ai demonstrates consistent execution and margin recovery, risk-averse investors would be better off exiting their positions.

How Should You Play Nebius Stock Going Into Q1 Earnings?,1747402560000,"Nebius Group N.V . NBIS will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 20, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 45 cents. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past seven days but has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $63.8 million.Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company. Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS’ Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS’ Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will ‍boast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. These behemoths already have a global-scale AI cloud, whereas NBIS is still expanding its infrastructure. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market.NBIS Stock PerformanceNebius shares have lost 19.5% over the past three months, underscoring broader and company-specific challenges. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector decline of 5.1% and the Zacks Internet Software Services industry’s gain of 4.3%.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its peers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 11.3% and 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame, while Microsoft has gained 10.7%.NBIS' ValuationIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 2.59X, lower than the Internet Software Services industry’s ratio of 4.12, but it could mean more risk than opportunity.Investment Thesis for NBIS StockGiven Nebius' ongoing investments in its core AI infrastructure platform and promising growth in Toloka and Avride platforms, long-term potential remains. However, significant margin pressure owing to ongoing investments and fierce competition from behemoths clouds the outlook. The negative Earnings ESP and muted stock performance further temper expectations. Retaining NBIS stock ahead of earnings appears prudent, but cautious optimism is warranted.What to Do With NBIS Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds in the AI space, it is an exciting growth story, but one with competitive pressures that investors must closely monitor.NBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:fdddaf27b094b:0-how-should-you-play-nebius-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Weeks after Amazon's Alexa+ AI launch, a mystery: where are the users?",1747389600000,"Alexa, where are your users?More than six weeks after Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN began rolling out the new Alexa+ generative artificial-intelligence-powered voice assistant to hundreds of thousands of people, there is scant evidence it is in regular customers' hands.The new service was meant to be a triumph for Amazon after several delays in revamping Alexa in the age of AI chatbots like ChatGPT. The company signaled its significance by bringing CEO Andy Jassy to a February press event in New York where it showcased Alexa+’s capabilities and promised customers would start getting invite access in late March.“There seems to be no one who actually has it,” said Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponential, who attended the Alexa+ announcement event. “This fits a pattern of a lot of companies announcing services or products when they are awfully close to being ready, but not quite – that last mile is a lot farther away than they anticipated,” he said. In an ultimately unsuccessful effort to locate real-world users of Alexa+, Reuters searched dozens of news sites, YouTube, TikTok, X, BlueSky and Meta's Instagram and Facebook, as well as Amazon's Twitch and reviews of Echo voice-assistant devices on Amazon.com. Two who posted on Reddit claimed to have used the service, but did not provide Reuters with hard evidence and their identities could not be corroborated. ""Hundreds of thousands of customers now have access to Alexa+ — of course, some are employees and their families, but the overwhelming majority are customers that requested early access,” said an Amazon spokesperson. That is up from the approximately 100,000 users that Amazon reported on May 1.Amazon did not say why there were no verifiable public reviews or reactions to the new service and declined to make available for an interview any active Alexa+ users. The company does not require nondisclosure agreements in exchange for Alexa+ access, a spokesperson said.The rollout of Amazon AI-assisted Alexa+ is proceeding slowly and the service has struggled with speed in answering some questions or prompts, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. It also occasionally generates inaccurate or fabricated information, like other AI models, and is expensive to operate, the people said.Accessed mainly through Amazon televisions and Echo devices, Alexa can set timers, answer search queries and tell the weather if a user requests it out loud. While Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL Siri voice assistant preceded the original Alexa by three years, it was the Amazon service that supercharged the acceptance of voice assistants. The overhaul resulting in the generative AI-infused Alexa+ is meant to revitalize the decade-old service and help Amazon compete with chatbots from OpenAI, Meta NASDAQ:META and others. Amazon has plowed billions into developing Alexa since it was introduced in 2014, but it has been unprofitable and the vision of customers using it for voice-shopping never materialized.Technology companies typically rely on a mix of analysts, product reviewers, social media influencers and reporters to help get the word out about their newest devices or services. Apple, considered a master of marketing, gives launch-event attendees limited access to its iPhones or laptops for initial reviews, followed shortly by lengthier scrutiny within days or weeks of announcement. Amazon itself gave reviewers time to test out its new color Kindle device at an event in October before making it available to buy just two weeks later.In September 2023, Amazon showed off a prior iteration of the generative AI-infused Alexa and said customers would be getting an ""early preview"" of it within weeks. It never came. Alexa+ will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and even act as an “agent” on behalf of users by taking actions for them without their direct involvement. That contrasts with the current iteration, which generally handles only a single request at a time.During Amazon’s first-quarter earnings call two weeks ago, Jassy said more than 100,000 people were already using the new voice service and that “people are really liking Alexa+ thus far.”Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said that by leaving a large gap between product launch and general availability, Amazon was failing to build anticipation for Alexa+. ""Just lean on your curated YouTube or TikTok advocates and tell them what to talk about,” he said. “Instead, this makes it look like they are worried about something.”Techsponential's Greengart said the February Alexa event could be seen as an early warning sign because attendees were not allowed to try the service themselves, instead being shuffled into breakout sessions where product managers ran through well-rehearsed routines and answered limited questions. Reuters, which attended the event, was also unable to try out the service.By contrast, at Amazon’s 2014 launch for its Fire Phone, users could hold the device and try its features. The original Echo device, running the Alexa service, became available weeks after its announcement in November 2014 and users went public with their reactions that December.The upgraded Alexa is designed to allow users to seek shopping advice such as vacation outfits and to receive aggregated news stories. As shown, it is meant to carry out more complicated requests, such as ordering food for delivery while also remembering a user’s dietary preferences.To demonstrate Alexa+'s broad use, Amazon pointed to an April TechRadar story that cited an anonymous Reddit post from a user claiming to have tested the service. The Reddit post has since been deleted.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0TK:0-weeks-after-amazon-s-alexa-ai-launch-a-mystery-where-are-the-users/"
Consumer Stocks Have Taken It on the Chin. Buy These 8. — Barrons.com,1747936800000,"By Jacob SonenshineConsumer stocks are down, but not out. A handful look like buys now.The latest blow came on Wednesday when bond yields popped — and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund and the SPDR S&P Retail Exchange-Traded Fund fell 2% and 3.1%, respectively. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%. Higher yields make borrowing money more expensive, which reduces consumer spending.Both funds had been on a rough stretch before Wednesday because of Wall Street's unease about the consumer companies' earnings. The higher bond yields are making investor sentiment worse, after what's been a steep drop in consumer confidence because of tariffs, which make good and services more expensive. For the year, the broader consumer discretionary ETF is off 4.5% and the retail ETF is down 5.4%. The S&P 500 has dropped only 0.5%.The silver lining is that there are select stocks that not only trade at cheaper prices now, but are also positioned for high earnings growth. Buying them right now makes sense.Citi strategist Scott Chronert looked for the ones to scoop up. He screened for consumer companies with sales that are relatively less sensitive to changes in broader economic activity, and have invested heavily in their businesses to spark high growth.Chronert started with 280 consumer stocks. He had two criteria for companies: sales less correlated to gross domestic product activity in recent years and capital expenditures that represent a relatively large ratio to annual depreciation expense. The second criteria is important because, as long-term assets depreciate, companies that are replacing those assets — and adding more — are signaling that they're prepared for ever-higher demand because they're aggressively growing.Names on the screen are Amazon.com, Costco, Tractor Supply, Procter & Gamble, Kroger, and Domino's Pizza.Another is Walmart. It's a rare retailer whose total sales aren't so sensitive to changes in consumer demand because the majority of its sales come from groceries.The discount chain has plenty of growth potential: Its total capital expenditures in the past five years, including analysts' estimates for this year, are $95 billion, about 1.6 times total depreciation expense in that period. So for every dollar of asset value lost, Walmart invests more than a dollar to increase its asset base. It's beefing up its capabilities for buy-online-pickup-in-store, e-commerce, and advertising.The idea is to add revenue streams and gradually take business from other retail outlets. That's why, after sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter, analysts expect just over 4% sales growth annually over the next three years to $768 billion, according to FactSet. That's nothing to scoff at for an already-large retailer that's outperforming other retailers. Target, for example, saw sales decline in the first quarter.Walmart's sales growth can nudge profit margins higher, which analysts forecast. If it needs to raise prices it can, though most of the growth in the first quarter came from more purchases rather than higher prices. As the advertising business ramps up, it can contribute to higher margins since the ad business generally has lower costs versus retail.Plus, Walmart is buying back stock every quarter, helping push analysts' EPS growth projections close to 10% annually.That can bring the stock higher, assuming shares aren't priced too expensively. They trade at what appears on the surface to be an expensive just over 35 times expected earnings for the coming 12 months. But at just over twice the retail fund's 14.8 times, it's about in line with the type of premium it has tended to fetch over the past couple of years, given its consistent earnings and growth trajectory.Walmart is a textbook example of a winning consumer stock right now. So are the other seven.Just remember: Consumer stocks aren't all the same.

"Away, an Original Internet Darling, Will Sell Its Luggage in More Places — WSJ",1747348200000,"By Katie DeightonAway, the luggage and travel brand that found its fame selling fashionable luggage directly to consumers online, has named new leadership and begun selling beyond its own website and branded stores as it tries to reach more consumers.Jen Rubio, a co-founder of Away and its chief executive officer since 2021, stepped down this week and assumed the role of executive chair. She was succeeded by Jessica Schinazi, a former executive at appliance-maker Dyson, fashion house LVMH and Amazon.com who had been president of Away since December.In a press release, Rubio described Schinazi as the right leader for Away because of her focus on operations. ""This transition is a natural next step for Away,"" said Rubio, who has built a luxury real-estate portfolio with her husband, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield.This week, Away began selling some of its suitcases and bags on Amazon's U.S. website. It also announced that another selection will be available for purchase at Nordstrom locales and via the department store's website later this month. The brand made its first foray into wholesale with Dick's Sporting Goods last year.The moves are a departure for Away, which until recently had exclusively sold its luggage via its own channels. Founded in 2015, the company was part of a pack of direct-to-consumer startups that sidestepped traditional retailers and drew online shoppers with digital advertising, easy-to-navigate websites and stylish branding. Rubio and her co-founder, Steph Korey Goodwin, had both worked previously at direct-to-consumer eyewear brand Warby Parker.Like many later players from the direct-to-consumer boom, Away decided it would benefit from at least a limited presence in physical retail. Since 2016, it has opened 17 stand-alone stores primarily on the East and West coasts and in Texas, and plans to open more, targeting customers who want to see a $275 carry-on in real life before buying.Despite those physical stores, some shoppers outside those locations were ""saying, 'Hey, you're not in my city, and I really want to go and touch the products,'"" Schinazi said. Others wanted to shop at a department store to compare brands and collect loyalty points, she added. Deals with companies like Nordstrom, which carries competitor brands like Béis, Monos and Samsonite, ""feel like a really good way to meet the customers where they are in those locations right now,"" she said.As for Amazon, Away knew that potential customers were already searching for its name on the marketplace and winding up buying from companies that attached their products to the brand via search engine optimization practices.The company's Amazon storefront lists nine products, including its flagship suitcases. Nordstrom will carry a different selection, including Away's pricier aluminum suitcases and its softside luggage.Away also plans to use new sponsorship deals to help spread its brand further offline. On Thursday, the company announced its new title as the Official Luggage Partner of the WNBA's New York Liberty. That follows a December partnership with the F1 Academy, Formula One Group's female-only racing championship, which saw Scottish driver Logan Hannah take to a track in Abu Dhabi in an Away-branded livery and race suit.In 2019, Away said its sales had totaled $150 million in 2018, and the company was valued at $1.4 billion following a $100 million funding round. The pandemic, however, decimated sales, sending them into a tailspin of more than 90% and forcing the company to furlough or lay off the majority of its staff.Sales and staffing levels have since rebounded, though Away has still had to make head-count cuts, including a 25% reduction last year. Since 2020, it has employed a procession of chief marketing officers, including Selena Kalvaria, Melissa Weiss and Carla Dunham, who left in early 2024 after just over a year in the job.Marketing, including a February collaboration with the HBO resort drama ""White Lotus,"" is now overseen by Christine Gallagher, vice president of integrated marketing.The company declined to disclose recent sales figures.Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515014326:0/

Startup Anthropic says its new AI model can code for hours at a time,1747936024000,"Artificial intelligence lab Anthropic unveiled its latest top-of-the-line technology called Claude Opus 4 on Thursday, which it says can write computer code autonomously for much longer than its prior systems.The startup, backed by Google-parent Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , has distinguished its work in part by building AI that excels at coding. It also announced another AI model Claude Sonnet 4, Opus's smaller and more cost-effective cousin.Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger called the release a milestone in Anthropic's work to make increasingly autonomous AI. He said in an interview with Reuters that customer Rakuten had Opus 4 coding for nearly seven hours, while an Anthropic researcher set up the AI model to play 24 hours of a Pokemon game. That's up from about 45 minutes of game play for its prior model Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic told MIT Technology Review.""For AI to really have the economic and productivity impact that I think it can have, the models do need to be able to work autonomously and work coherently for that (longer) amount of time,"" he said.The news follows a flurry of other AI announcements this week, including from Google, with which Anthropic also competes. Anthropic also said its new AI models can give near-instant answers or take longer to reason through questions, as well as do web search. And it said its Claude Code tool for software developers was now generally available after Anthropic had previewed it in February.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU0V9:0-startup-anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-can-code-for-hours-at-a-time/"

"Should You Buy, Hold or Sell OKTA Stock Before Q1 Earnings Release?",1747930320000,"Okta OKTA is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 27.For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, Okta anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of 76-77 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

US FTC chair seeks to trim agency by around 10%,1747327488000,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is looking to trim its headcount by around 10%, its chairman told Congress on Thursday, insisting the agency will be able to continue antitrust and consumer protection work with what would be its smallest staff in 10 years.The FTC is in the midst of an ""unprecedented time,"" pursuing antimonopoly cases against companies including Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN and Deere & Co NYSE:DE , while going after the largest pharmacy benefit managers over insulin pricing, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson told a U.S. House of Representatives panel. But he said shrinking the agency further would not hamper that work.""In terms of accomplishing our mission, we can accomplish the mission with 1,100 employees. I have no doubt about it. Because our people are really, really good, and we have shifted our priority, especially away from rulemaking,"" Ferguson said.So far this year, 94 employees have departed the agency, leaving 1,221 full-time employees, Ferguson said. While it laid off a handful of probationary employees, the agency is offering buyouts and has not yet enacted reductions in force.Ferguson did not disclose the details of the FTC's budget request, but said around 1,100 was a healthy staffing level given the agency's current funding. Ferguson's predecessor, Lina Khan, had hired more staff than the agency could afford, he said.The agency has also brought down its contract spending by more than $6 million this year, Ferguson said. Two workers from the Department of Government Efficiency have helped identify contracts to be cut or scaled back, he added.The agency is eyeing ways to reduce its spending on outside data storage providers, and curb the bills from expert trial witnesses that can run as high as $30 million for one case.Ferguson responded to concerns that DOGE, the Elon Musk-led initiative to downsize the government, could gain access to confidential business information, including on Musk's competitors, that the FTC uses to review mergers.He said DOGE workers are subject to the same restrictions as all other FTC employees and cannot access information without appropriate justification.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RN0VL:0-us-ftc-chair-seeks-to-trim-agency-by-around-10/"

Spotify Stock Skyrockets 112% in a Year: What's Next for Investors?,1747319040000,"Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT shares have skyrocketed 112.4% in a year, outperforming the 32.5% rally of its industry and the 12.4% rise in the Zacks S&P 500 Composite.SPOT has outperformed its streaming rivals Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN for the same period. Apple and Amazon have jumped 12.4% and 14.5% in the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceThe massive rise in Spotify shares may appeal to investors. However, the eminent question that lingers is whether it is the right to invest in SPOT.SPOT’s Growth Catalyst is Its User Base ExpansionSpotify demonstrated an impressive first-quarter 2025 performance, driven by user growth. The company added nearly 3 million monthly active users (MAU) and 5 million net new subscribers in a single quarter, portraying its ability to attract and retain users globally. This growing user base acts as a vital asset for revenue growth in the future. It not only boosts direct premium subscriptions but also enhances the potential to monetize its ad-supported tier.This strong user rise lays a solid ground for positive developments. Latching onto its continued scalability, the company reinforces its network effects, attracting more users and content creators. Also, Spotify’s CEO’s aspirational vision of touching 1 billion subscribers shines a light on its long-term growth trajectory.The company can improve its top and bottom line by a huge margin, given that it can achieve the desired number and can exercise strategic price adjustments in mature markets. Initiatives like the Spotify Partner Program, targeted at onboarding more video podcasters, hold the potential to widen the platform’s content offerings. This will also attract a wide audience and fuel further MAU growth and engagement in the long run.Spotify is well-positioned to zoom past its competitors and become the dominant audio streaming platform by capitalizing on its user base expansion, and tactfully investing in monetization and content strategy.Spotify’s Promising Top & Bottom-Line ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPOT’s 2025 and 2026 revenues is pegged at $19.9 billion and 22.8 billion, implying 17.4% and 14.3% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus estimate for Spotify’s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share stands at $9.88 and $13.69, suggesting 66.1% and 38.5% year-over-year increases, respectively.SPOT’s Liquidity Position Lags IndustrySpotify’s current ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2025 stood at 1.48, which sets a good tone for investors. However, something that can raise concern is its stance when compared with the industry average. Currently, the industry average is 2.54, which is substantially higher than SPOT’s current ratio. Adding to this concern, the metric has declined 21% from the preceding quarter. If continued, it can hurt the company’s liquidity position. Intense Competition Hurts SpotifyApple Music and Amazon Music are the most notable competitors of Spotify. The financial strength of these companies is something to look out for. These major players can use their financial prowess to reduce streaming prices, and lower or limit content availability, thereby hurting SPOT’s monetization strategy.Such an incident can bleed into hurting the company’s stock price. Strong reliance on third-party content licenses exposes Spotify to royalty cost hikes, affecting margins as the company expands its content offerings to include audiobooks and video.SPOT Stock Looks PriceySpotify’s stock price increase led to elevated valuations. It is priced at 56.1 times forward 12-month earnings per share, which is higher than the industry’s average of 37.8 times. When looking at the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA ratio, Spotify is trading at 62.1 times, far exceeding the industry’s average of 13.5 times. Spotify: Wait & WatchSPOT’s user base expansion is the key to success as it positions the company well for revenue growth. The company provides a strong top and bottom-line outlook, which favors its long-term growth objective.Spotify’s robust liquidity position reaffirms its financial strength. However, the market in which the company operates poses a substantial threat to its performance. Adding to this concern is its premium valuation, hurting investor sentiment.We recommend investors take a cautious approach and initiate a “Hold” strategy. Increasing exposure is suggested after signs of lasting growth and a more attracting valuation appears.Spotify carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

European regulators crack down on Big Tech,1747317006000,"European regulators have launched a series of investigations into Big Tech in recent years.Here are some of the actions taken:DIGITAL SERVICES ACTTech companies are required to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content on their platforms under the EU's Digital Services Act that came into effect last year.Social media app TikTok was charged by the European Commission on May 15 for failing to comply with the DSA's obligation to publish an advertisement repository that allows researchers and users to detect scam advertisements, with its owner ByteDance now at risk of a fine of as much as 6% of its global turnover.This marks only the second ruling by EU tech regulators following the introduction of the DSA, after Elon Musk's social media network X was charged with breaching its content rules last year.Meta's Facebook and Instagram are being investigated for potential breaches of EU online content rules relating to child safety, which could lead to hefty fines, the Commission said in May 2024.DIGITAL MARKETS ACTThe European Union's Digital Markets Act took effect in 2022 with the aim of curbing the power of Big Tech and ensuring a level playing field for smaller rivals.Apple NASDAQ:AAPL was fined 500 million euros ($570 million) and Meta NASDAQ:META 200 million euros under the DMA on April 23. People with direct knowledge of the matter had in March said the fines would be modest, as the antitrust enforcer was focused on making sure companies comply with the law rather than sanctioning them.The investigations were part of three probes started by the European Commission, which acts as the EU competition watchdog.The EC is also investigating Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google over possible breaches, and charged Meta last July for failing to comply with the DMA in its new pay or consent advertising model.In September 2023, the EU named 22 ""gatekeeper"" services run by Alphabet, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Apple, Meta, Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and TikTok-owner ByteDance, giving them six months to comply with the provisions of the DMA.Meta and TikTok appealed against the gatekeeper status in November 2023, with the latter losing a bid to suspend its designation in February 2024. Apple said in April 2024 it would continue to engage with the Commission to comply with the rules.ANTITRUSTThe European Commission fined Meta 797.72 million euros in November for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.In September, Google won its challenge against a 1.49-billion-euro antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising.A week earlier, Google lost its fight against a 2.42-billion-euro fine by EU antitrust regulators seven years ago for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.On the same day, Apple lost the fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, as part of a larger crackdown against sweetheart deals between multinationals and EU countries.Regulators said last July that Apple had agreed to open its tap-and-go mobile payments system to rivals to settle an EU antitrust probe. Brussels fined Apple 1.84 billion euros in March 2024 for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.The Commission in June charged Microsoft with illegally bundling its chat and video app Teams with its Office product. It is also probing Microsoft's security software practices, a document seen by Reuters showed in February. EUROPEAN STATESIndividual European countries have also taken actions against Big Tech.Apple lost an appeal on March 18 against a regulatory assessment that opens it up to stricter controls in Germany, following years of debate over its market position.Britain's antitrust regulator in September provisionally found Google had abused its dominant position in digital advertising to restrict competition. A month earlier, it started probes into its parent Alphabet and Amazon's collaboration with AI startup Anthropic.Other measures include a fine against Meta in Italy over unfair commercial practices and a French fine against Google for breaching EU intellectual property rules.A Spanish regulator, meanwhile, opened an investigation into possible anti-competitive behaviour by Apple's App Store in July.($1 = 0.9060 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RN1B8:0-european-regulators-crack-down-on-big-tech/"

Best Gig Economy Stocks to Monitor Amid its Growing Popularity,1747313580000,"An updated edition of the March 25, 2025 article.The emergence of the gig economy concept has reshaped the landscape of traditional employment. The gig economy offers workers the freedom and flexibility to set their work hours, workload, and even their workspace. The resultant flexibility helps accommodate diverse lifestyles and personal commitments. No wonder this trend gained immense popularity, both during and in the post-pandemic scenario, with workers and companies constantly seeking more flexible and innovative work arrangements.The gig economy concept encourages workers to engage in short-term, freelance, or contract-based work. The advantages associated with the gig economy are being utilized by multiple companies, ranging from rideshares like Uber UBER and Lyft LYFT to food delivery entities like DoorDash DASH. Moreover, platforms like  Upwork  UPWK and  Fiverr  FVRR connect skilled freelancers with businesses for short-term projects, in turn allowing professionals to choose their schedules.Agreed that this flexibility comes at the cost of job security and benefits like healthcare and retirement plans associated with traditional employment. However, the lure of being one’s own boss often overrides these disadvantages. With a focus on work-life balance, the gig economy concept is gaining immense popularity. This can be gauged from the fact that the gig economy market is expected to reach $648.8 billion in 2025 and $2.15 trillion by 2033, from $556.7 billion in 2024. This implies that the market is likely to witness a compound annual growth rate of about 16.2% in the 2025-2033 timeframe.These numbers showcase the immense potential for gig economy-focused companies. With our thematic screens, one can easily spot stocks tied to trends shaping the future of investing. If the gig economy appeals to you and you’re looking to align your portfolio with this rising trend, now might be the time to consider stocks like  Amazon  AMZN, Lyft, and Angi ANGI.Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with  Zacks Thematic Screens   and uncover your next big opportunity.Amazon ’ s dominance extends far beyond e-commerce. The company is a significant player in the gig economy by offering flexible, short-term work opportunities through multiple programs like Flex, Delivery Service Partners (DSP), Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and its tech backbone, Amazon Web Services (AWS).Flex, launched in 2015, allows drivers to deliver packages using their own vehicles, offering flexible schedules and supplementary income. In 2018, DSP took things further, enabling entrepreneurs to launch delivery businesses, allowing them to hire drivers, lease vans and manage local deliveries. On the digital side, MTurk brings crowdsourcing to life. This platform connects businesses with a global pool of freelancers for tasks like data tagging and survey participation. Meanwhile, AWS serves as the gig economy’s cloud computing powerhouse. It powers platforms like Uber and DoorDash, ensuring seamless operations.By combining delivery, crowdsourcing, and cloud computing, Amazon has emerged as a major player in the gig economy space. Through its endeavors, the company is streamlining business processes and providing gig workers with new opportunities. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Lyft  is one of the leading players in the ride-hailing segment, providing drivers with a flexible platform to earn income using personal vehicles. It generates most of its revenues from ridesharing, where drivers pay service fees and commissions for using its platform. The company’s offerings extend beyond ride-hailing to include shared rides, electric bike and scooter rentals and public transit partnerships.Lyft’s drivers can choose when and how much they work, offering flexibility and autonomy. The company’s gig-based approach permits drivers to work part-time or full-time and choose their work schedule. Their income is determined by the fares they earn from rides, which also includes potential surge pricing during peak demand. However, expenses like fuel and maintenance are deducted to arrive at net profit.Lyft utilizes its platform to connect riders with drivers, offering a flexible and on-demand transportation service. By consistently focusing on providing opportunities for flexible income, Lyft underscores the value and potential of gig-based transportation solutions, making it a vital part of the modern workforce. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Angi  highlights the evolving nature of the gig economy by bridging the gap between homeowners and skilled service professionals. Angi's focus on the gig economy has contributed to its growth as a leading online marketplace for home services in the United States.Angi, through its subsidiary Handy Technologies, highlights the evolution of the gig economy into home services. Handy Technologies offers services in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. It is an online two-sided marketplace (an intermediary economic platform, having two distinct user groups that provide each other with network benefits) for residential cleaning, installation and other home services.The platform acts as a marketplace where independent contractors — from electricians and plumbers to landscapers and handymen — can connect with consumers needing services. By leveraging technology, Angi not only streamlines the process of finding reliable professionals but also supports flexible, on-demand work for these gig workers.

Wall Street futures slip after three-day rally as traders await Powell speech,1747307739000,"US stock futures edged lower Thursday after three straight days of gains, as markets digested a temporary truce in U.S.-China tariff tensions and eyed fresh economic data for clues on inflation and growth. All eyes now turn to US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H.

Nordstrom Stock Just Delisted. Macy's and Dillard's Are the Department Stores Left Standing. — Barrons.com,1747855320000,"By Teresa RivasAnd then there were two.Macy's and Dillard's are the only publicly traded traditional, mall-based department stores now that Nordstrom's has gone private.JWN is no more. After years of will-they-or-won't-they speculation and failed deals, the Nordstrom family finally found a buyer for their Seattle-based retail chain — and the stock was delisted on Wednesday.The acquisition, announced near the end of last year, is an all-cash acquisition priced at $24.25 a share in partnership with Mexican department store operator El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. The Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company and Liverpool will own the other 49.9%.The Nordstrom family had owned about a third of Nordstrom's shares outstanding and Liverpool had owned approximately 10%. The deal, which shareholders signed off on earlier this month, includes a special dividend of 25 cents.That's a far cry from the $50 per-share offer the family had made in 2018. Then again, the retail landscape has essentially been transformed. One of the few constants is the incredibly shrinking footprint of the department store.Today, just Macy's and Dillard's are the stocks for those who want to invest in the true traditional department store.Once a mainstay of American retail, department stores were KO'd by e-commerce and discounters like TJ Maxx and Marshalls.Most went down for the count — remember Barney's? — though a few of the old names got back up but are beyond dazed. J.C. Penney and Sears operate a handful of stores postbankruptcy, and Lord and Taylor and Mervyns live online only.So it's up to Macy's and Dillard's to carry on the fight.Macy's has never retaken its 2015 all-time high. The stock is down about 40% in the past year, leaving it with a market cap of $3.3 billion. An accounting error that paid executives too much didn't help. Only 14 analysts tracked by FactSet still cover the stockand 70% of them rate it at Hold or the equivalent.Dillard's, with a market cap of $6.4 billion, actually has a stronger punch. True, only four analysts track the stock and not one is bullish on it. But the stock has defied the naysayers, hitting all-time highs earlier this year. The company's one-two combo of cost discipline and focus on higher-margin categories is allowing it to deliver a string of better-than-expected results.Kohl's is sometimes counted as department-store stock. However, the company has always favored off-mall locations. For a time, that strategy, along with partnering with Amazon.com to accept its returns, allowed it to outperform other department stores.In the past year, though, stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value — hurt by the firing of its CEO and disappointing results. The company lost a chance to be acquired for more than $60 a share in 2022, and now changes hands for $8.Life for department stores is rough — and has been for the past decade. Maybe even longer. The American shopper wants to buy online and get rock-bottom prices, which explains the rise of the discounter.Even catering to the well-to-to hasn't shielded those great retailers, as evidenced by companies like Neiman Marcus and Henri Bendel.So Macy's and Dillard's are left to go it alone. Nordstrom keep getting jabbed at by shifting tastes and tariffs and online stores — both here and abroad — but at the least it won't have to share the details of that fight every quarter.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Palantir Stock Hits Another All-Time High. The AI Trade Is On Fire. — Barrons.com,1747248540000,"By Adam LevinePalantir stock touched its second all-time high of the week on Wednesday, reaching $133.49 in intraday trading, before pulling back slightly.Palantir is a stock given to sharp moves. It has been a particularly wild ride for Palantir shareholders since the company reported first-quarter earnings on May 5. While it was a strong quarter that beat analysts expectations, and included raised 2025 guidance, the stock fell 12% the next day to $108.86. It closed out last week at $117.30, and then rose to $128.10 on Tuesday, after touching an intraday high of $130.60.The stock's success has also been tied to broader market sentiment around artificial intelligence. The so-called AI trade has come storming back in recent weeks. The Trump administration's pullback on tariffs has restored investors' tolerance, and enthusiasm, for riskier growth stocks.Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined a group of tech leaders who accompanied President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia this week, where new AI deals were announced by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Amazon. Karp was likely there to talk about defense contracts.Palantir stock has been subject to ""on-again, off-again applause,"" on Wall Street, Barron's wrote in a recent feature on the company. ""The business has become the subject of great debate, ranging from Karp's views on Silicon Valley and politics to the scale of opportunity that lies ahead for the company's unique approach to software,"" Barron's wrote.Wall Street holds a wide range of views on the stock with analyst price targets currently ranging from $40 to $140.Since going public in September 2020, Palantir stock is up 1,262% for a 76% annualized return.

Aramco Signs Deals With U.S. Companies With Potential Value of $90 Billion,1747245120000,"By Adria CalatayudSaudi Arabia's national oil company said it signed agreements with U.S. companies with a potential value of $90 billion, covering everything from liquefied-natural-gas purchases to artificial intelligence.Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, said Wednesday that it signed 34 memoranda of understanding and agreements with major companies such as Exxon Mobil, Nvidia and Amazon.com.The deals come after a U.S.-Saudi investment forum held in Riyadh on Tuesday during President Trump's four-day visit to the Middle East.Aramco said the preliminary deals and agreements cover collaborations and partnerships relating to its upstream and downstream activities, technology, technical services and finance.The Saudi company reached a final agreement to buy 1.2 million tons a year of LNG for a 20-year term from NextDecade's Rio Grande LNG export project in Texas and signed a deal with Exxon to evaluate an upgrade of their Samref refinery in Saudi Arabia, it said.Aramco also entered into a preliminary agreement with Nvidia to develop advanced industrial AI computing infrastructure and into digital-transformation deals with Amazon and Qualcomm.Oil-field service groups SLB, Halliburton and Baker Hughes also signed deals with Aramco, the Saudi company said.Aramco didn't break down the potential value of each deal.Write to Adria Calatayud at adria.calatayud@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250514010791:0-aramco-signs-deals-with-u-s-companies-with-potential-value-of-90-billion/
Amazon vs. Oracle: Which Cloud Computing Stock is a Better Bet?,1747834920000,"In the high-stakes world of cloud computing, Amazon.com AMZN and Oracle ORCL represent contrasting approaches to capturing the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and enterprise computing. Amazon, with its dominant Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud platform, continues to leverage its first-mover advantage and massive scale, while Oracle positions itself as a specialized provider of database and enterprise applications with growing cloud ambitions through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.Both tech giants have made significant investments in AI infrastructure and services, attempting to capitalize on the transformative technology that's reshaping industries worldwide. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for AMZN StockAmazon's cloud division, AWS, delivered impressive first-quarter 2025 results with revenues climbing 17% year over year to $29.3 billion, establishing an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. This robust performance demonstrates AWS' continued market leadership despite increasing competition. Amazon's aggressive expansion of AI capabilities, including the deployment of next-generation P6-B200 instances powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, positions the company at the forefront of the AI revolution.The company's retail business also shows remarkable resilience with record delivery speeds and strong consumer engagement. Amazon has successfully regionalized its fulfillment network, resulting in faster deliveries and lower costs. According to CEO Andy Jassy, everyday essentials grew twice as fast as the rest of the business and represented one out of every three units sold in the United States.Amazon's strategic investments extend beyond domestic markets. The company recently announced a $5+ billion partnership with Saudi Arabia's HUMAIN to build a groundbreaking ""AI Zone,"" demonstrating its global ambitions. Additionally, Amazon has rapidly expanded its AI model offerings in Bedrock, incorporating leading models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek, creating a comprehensive AI ecosystem for developers and enterprises.The company's financial health is equally impressive, with first-quarter operating income growing 20% year over year to $18.4 billion. Amazon beat Wall Street expectations with EPS of $1.59, exceeding forecasts by 23 cents. The company's diversified revenue streams, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and subscription services, provide multiple growth vectors and natural hedges against market volatility.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 net sales is pegged at $693.74 billion, indicating growth of 8.74% from the prior-year reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.3 per share, which indicates a jump of 13.92% from the year-ago period.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for ORCL StockOracle's recent performance has failed to impress investors, with third-quarter 2025 results falling short of expectations. Revenues reached $14.13 billion, growing just 6.40% year over year but missing projections by $259.18 million. Similarly, EPS of $1.47 missed estimates by 2 cents, reflecting execution challenges in a highly competitive market.While Oracle touts its cloud growth, the reality remains that its total cloud revenues of $6.2 billion are dwarfed by AWS' $29.3 billion quarterly revenues. Oracle's infrastructure scale limitations are evident as the company struggles to meet demand, with executives repeatedly citing ""capacity constraints"" as hurdles to faster growth. Despite adding its 101st cloud region, Oracle lacks the global reach and availability zones that Amazon offers.The company's strategic focus appears scattered across multiple fronts — healthcare partnerships, financial services products, and government initiatives — without the coherent vision that Amazon demonstrates. Oracle's heavy reliance on its database business makes it vulnerable to cloud-native alternatives and multi-cloud strategies that bypass Oracle's traditionally high-margin offerings.Though Oracle highlights its Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) growing 63% to $130 billion, skepticism exists around conversion rates and timing. The company's guidance for 15% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 seems ambitious given its consistent execution issues and history of overpromising. Oracle's AI strategy centers around its database offerings rather than providing the comprehensive AI ecosystem that AWS delivers.The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.3% over the past 60 days.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteDespite management's claims about cost advantages for AI workloads, Oracle lacks the semiconductor investments and specialized infrastructure that Amazon has built. The company's relatively modest $16 billion annual CapEx pales in comparison to Amazon's infrastructure investments, raising questions about Oracle's ability to compete at scale in the capital-intensive cloud and AI markets.Stock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonBoth companies trade at premium valuations, but Amazon offers superior value considering its growth prospects. Amazon's forward P/E of approximately 30.66x is justified by its diversified revenue streams, market leadership in multiple high-growth sectors, and consistent ability to exceed earnings expectations. Oracle's forward P/E of 24.2x appears superficially cheaper but represents a questionable value given its slower growth and execution challenges.AMZN vs. ORCL: P/E F12M RatioAmazon's recent price performance reflects investor confidence, with shares climbing 3.5% year in the past 6-month period, outperforming Oracle which declined 16.6%. Oracle's relative valuation discount reflects legitimate concerns about its competitive position and ability to capitalize on the AI revolution at scale.AMZN Outperforms ORCL in the Past 6-Month PeriodAmazon's enterprise value to free cash flow ratio provides a more compelling investment case, especially considering the company's proven ability to reinvest cash flows into high-return initiatives. While both companies offer cloud exposure, Amazon's diversification and scale provide a significantly more attractive risk-adjusted return profile than Oracle's narrower focus and smaller operational footprint.ConclusionAmazon emerges as the decidedly stronger investment opportunity in the cloud and AI race. Its superior scale, comprehensive AI capabilities, diversified revenue streams, and consistent execution provide a compelling foundation for long-term growth. While Oracle attempts to position itself as a specialized alternative, its smaller scale, execution missteps, and fragmented strategy make it a distant second in the cloud wars. Investors seeking exposure to the transformative potential of cloud computing and artificial intelligence would be better served by adding Amazon shares to their portfolios while reducing or avoiding Oracle positions. Amazon's demonstrated ability to continuously reinvent itself and its leadership position in multiple high-growth markets give it unmatched potential for sustained outperformance. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), whereas ORCL has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c981bb8e7094b:0-amazon-vs-oracle-which-cloud-computing-stock-is-a-better-bet/

"Alphabet Down 16% YTD: Are GOOGL Shares Buy, Sell or Hold on the Dip?",1747239240000,"Alphabet GOOGL shares have dropped 15.8% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s fall of 4.5%. The decline can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic conditions, moderating cloud growth, higher investments in developing cloud infrastructure and increasing regulatory headwinds.GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online this year, cloud revenues are expected to witness increased variability. The company expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, which is aimed at building up technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Alphabet expects advertising revenue growth to be lower due to a challenging year-over-year comparison. The company enjoyed solid growth in the financial services vertical in 2024.Regulatory headwinds like the lawsuit between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and GOOGL over Google Search are a concern. The DOJ argues that Google has inked anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine and plans to break up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android. DOJ’s proposal doesn’t bode well for Alphabet, given growing competition from AI-powered products like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity and Meta AI.Nevertheless, Alphabet’s focus on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud, driving top-line growth. Will AI focus drive Alphabet’s prospects this year? Let’s dig deep to find out.GOOGL Stock’s Performance  GOOGL’s Enhanced AI Usage to Aid ProspectsAt its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, GOOGL unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), expected to be available later this year. Google Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network (Cloud WAN), giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet showcased Willow, its new quantum chip, while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.Alphabet’s initiatives to infuse AI in Search are noteworthy. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Circle to Search was available on 250 million devices, with usage increasing roughly 40% during the quarter. Since October 2024, monthly visual searches with lens have increased by 5 billion. AI Overview is currently used by more than 1.5 billion people monthly. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview’s advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.In Cloud, Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and a low-code tool offering Agent Designer.Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination offers security offerings that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently. Wiz has a stellar clientele with its cloud security platform currently used by Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle. The Wiz buyout reflects the growing importance of Google Cloud in the company’s growth plans. The addition of Wiz to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing space.

Aramco says has US tie-ups worth up to $90 billion amid Trump Gulf tour,1747238890000,"Saudi Aramco TADAWUL:2222 said on Wednesday it had signed 34 preliminary deals with major U.S. companies, potentially worth up to $90 billion in a push to deepen commercial ties with the United States on the back of President Donald Trump's visit to the kingdom. The announcement was made a day after Riyadh pledged $600 billion in U.S. investments. Still, most tie-ups listed by the state oil giant were memorandums of understanding without a value attached. Some deals have also been previously announced, such as the agreement to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG per year for a 20-year term from NextDecade NASDAQ:NEXT . The agreements underscore Saudi Arabia’s efforts to strengthen its energy partnerships and attract foreign investment as it looks to balance oil dominance with broader industrial and technological growth under Vision 2030. ""The U.S. is really a good place to put our investment,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on Tuesday at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh. The forum coincided with Trump's four-day tour of the Gulf, marked by lavish receptions and a series of business deals, including $142 billion in arms agreements.Aramco is the economic backbone of Saudi Arabia, generating a bulk of the kingdom's revenue through oil exports and funding its ambitious Vision 2030 diversification drive. Its shares have fallen almost 9% this year. FLURRY OF SIGNINGS The company said the agreements, struck through its Aramco Group Companies, aim to build on its longstanding ties with U.S. companies, enhance shareholder value, and expand collaboration in energy and other strategic sectors.A memorandum of understanding with tech heavyweight Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA aims to establish advanced industrial AI infrastructure, including an AI Hub, an engineering and robotics centre, and workforce training programmes.Aramco also signed an MoU with ExxonMobil NYSE:XOM to evaluate a significant upgrade to their SAMREF refinery, with plans to expand it into an integrated petrochemical complex.It also inked a non-binding agreement with Amazon Web Services NASDAQ:AMZN to collaborate on digital transformation and lower-carbon initiatives, while an MoU with Qualcomm NASDAQ:QCOM focuses on collaboration in enhancing industrial networks and AI capabilities.""Our U.S.-related activities have evolved over the decades, and now include multi-disciplinary R&D, the Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, start-up investments, potential collaborations in LNG, and ongoing procurement,"" Nasser said in a statement. Aramco said on Tuesday it would invest $3.4 billion to expand the Motiva refinery in Texas. Beyond energy, the state oil giant has become a key vehicle for industrial development, digital transformation, and foreign investment.It expanded existing relationships with several high-profile U.S. suppliers including SLB NYSE:SLB , Baker Hughes NASDAQ:BKR , GE Vernova NYSE:GEV and Honeywell NASDAQ:HON . On the financial services front, it has forged agreements with asset management giants PIMCO, State Street Corporation and Wellington.It also signed a deal for short-term cash investments through a unified investment fund, named 'Fund of One', with financial heavyweights BlackRock NYSE:BLK , Goldman Sachs NYSE:GS , Morgan Stanley NYSE:MS and PIMCO.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM0T6:0-aramco-says-has-us-tie-ups-worth-up-to-90-billion-amid-trump-gulf-tour/"
UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

C3.ai Trading at a Premium at 6.39X: Time to Hold or Sell the Stock?,1747760040000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector’s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai’s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels.

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold JD.com Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747234800000,"JD.com JD, the supply chain-based e-commerce giant in China, reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2025 results. Its revenues in the quarter increased 15.8% year over year to RMB 301.1 billion ($41.5 billion), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. The company reported non-GAAP diluted net income per share of RMB 8.41 ($1.16), which rose 48.8% year over year. The figure beat the consensus estimate by 10.48%. The solid performance can be attributed to improving consumer sentiment and continued enhancements in JD’s supply chain capabilities and user experience. The company’s strategic involvement in AI and robotics positions it for long-term growth. However, despite the long-term growth prospects, JD is facing several near-term headwinds, which should caution investors. Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the company to understand why investors should consider avoiding the stock till clearer recovery indicators emerge.JD Faces Pressures in the New Business SegmentJD’s new business segment posted a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB 1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025, despite an 18% year-over-year revenue increase. The loss was mainly driven by the aggressive expansion of its food delivery business, which is still in its early stages and failed to make a meaningful contribution to financial performance during the quarter.The food delivery initiative, although showing user traction, remains a drag on profitability. With operations only beginning to scale at the end of the first quarter, JD incurred significant costs without a corresponding revenue impact. The company remains in the early phase of developing its food delivery operations, with continued system improvements required to enhance both user experience and operational efficiency.JD’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.59 per share, which has been revised downward by 3.16% over the past 30 days, indicating 7.75% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2025 revenues is pegged at $172.07 billion, suggesting 7.04% year-over-year growth.JD.com’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 25.23%.JD.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusJD.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | JD.com, Inc. QuoteJD Operates in an Intensely Competitive MarketThe online retail industry in China is intensely competitive. JD.com’s current competitors in China include Alibaba BABA and PDD Holdings Inc. Sponsored ADR PDD. Globally, JD.com faces intense competition from the e-commerce behemoth Amazon AMZN. Alibaba commands roughly 80% of China’s e-commerce market, while PDD Holdings Inc. attracts consumers with aggressive discounts and group-buying offers. Amazon remains highly competitive in retail through its unbeatable pricing, wide selection, and convenience.Tough competition can hurt JD by reducing its profit margins, shrinking its market share, weakening its brand, or even causing big losses. When setting prices, the company has to look at what competitors are charging for similar products. If rivals lower their prices or offer extra perks, the company may have to do the same to stay competitive. Otherwise, it risks losing customers, which could hurt its business and financial performance.Some of JD’s current competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customer bases and higher penetration in the market, which poses a major threat to the company.JD Stock Price Performance and ValuationJD shares have returned 7.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s growth of 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500 index’s decline of 0.5% in the same time frame.However, JD has underperformed its industry peers, BABA and PDD. Shares of BABA and PDD have gained 55.3% and 23.2%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. Shares of AMZN have lost 3.6% in the same time frame. JD.com’s YTD Price Return PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, JD currently trades at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 7.94X, which is well below the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s 22.94X. This suggests that investors may be paying a lower price relative to the company's expected earnings growth.JD’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationConclusionJD.com delivered a strong first-quarter performance, but near-term prospects seem murky. Losses in its new business segment, particularly food delivery, and aggressive investments in AI, automation, and logistics are weighing on near-term profitability. The company’s latest move, launching an international all-cargo air route between Wuhu, China and Hanoi, Vietnam, adds to JD’s capital expenditure without offering near-term contribution. With earnings estimates trending downward and intensifying market competition, investors should consider exiting positions. Until clearer signs of recovery emerge, JD.com is best avoided.JD currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e42627330094b:0-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-jd-com-stock-after-q1-earnings-beat/
Criteo Stock Plunges 29% YTD: Should You Buy the Dip or Wait?,1747753140000,"Criteo CRTO shares have lost 29.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 1.4% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 0.7%. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry’s growth of 17.2% in the same time frame.The stock’s underperformance can be attributed to the effect of tariffs and inflation surrounding the industry. Criteo, although showing a dip at the moment, is poised for long-term growth even amid the macroeconomic uncertainties. The company is taking strategic steps to drive its prospects. Let’s take a closer look at how CRTO is laying the foundation for sustained growth.Strategic Shifts to Reinforce Retail Media and MonetizationCriteo has been transitioning from its legacy retargeting business toward high-growth areas, such as Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, Retail Media on-platform revenues grew 21% year over year, driven by increased advertiser and retailer demand. Off-platform monetization also grew, supported by a 60% increase in supply partners. This can be attributed to the company’s work with retailers like Michaels, Dollar Tree and Meijer, and its expansion of on-site monetization and self-service platforms.Commerce Audiences is another area of focus, with more than 250 brands onboarded to its expanded platform to date. With more first-party data integrations and growing demand for performance-based upper-funnel targeting, this business is positioned to scale throughout 2025.Criteo S.A. Price and ConsensusCriteo S.A. price-consensus-chart | Criteo S.A. QuoteCriteo’s Competition and How CRTO Stands OutCriteo operates in a crowded space, competing with tech giants like Amazon AMZN, Google GOOGL, and The Trade Desk TTD. Amazon uses its shopper data to sell ads directly on its platform, while The Trade Desk helps brands buy ads across the open Internet with data-driven tools. Google rivals Criteo with ads across Search, YouTube and websites, using its vast user data. Shares of Amazon, Google and The Trade Desk have lost 6%, 12.1% and 35.1%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. While these players dominate in various channels, Criteo differentiates itself by providing retailer-direct access and a transparent, demand-driven platform that aligns with first-party data needs. With its broad retail network, proprietary Shopper Graph, and AI-based performance engine, Criteo offers measurable returns to brands and retailers, an advantage it plans to expand upon through continued platform investment and innovation.CRTO’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRTO’s 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $3.46 per share, which has been revised upward by 8.46% over the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 16.98%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.41%.CRTO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 45.42%.Here’s Why You Should Buy CRTO Stock NowCriteo is now focusing on high-growth areas like Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, the company expanded its advertiser base by 11% year over year and drove strong platform adoption across key retailers like Michaels and Meijer. New features such as dynamic sponsored products and video ads have strengthened its product suite, while recent wins in categories like grocery and home improvement reflect growing market traction. With more than 250 brands using Commerce Audiences and self-service adoption rising, Criteo is building momentum. Backed by a clear product roadmap, the company is positioning itself for long-term success.CRTO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

Top Health & Fitness Stocks to Buy for the Wellness Boom,1747227420000,"An updated edition of the March 24, 2025 article.The health and fitness space has transformed into a thriving industry, fueled by growing public interest in leading healthier lives. More people are prioritizing wellness, pushing up demand for gyms, supplements, and holistic services. Tech has played a big role here — wearable devices and digital platforms have made it easier than ever to monitor progress and stay motivated. At the same time, rising concerns around obesity, chronic illness, and mental health are prompting even more individuals to adopt fitness-focused lifestyles.Tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN are leaning into this shift. Apple’s ecosystem includes the Apple Watch and its Fitness+ service, offering users real-time health data and guided workouts. Amazon is also making moves in healthcare with acquisitions like One Medical, combining artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools with virtual care. These efforts are reshaping how people manage their health, and in turn, accelerating industry growth.Looking ahead, the global health and wellness market is expected to hit around $1.1 trillion by 2034, at a steady 7.33% CAGR from 2025. Emphasis on preventive care, alongside corporate wellness programs and government-backed initiatives, is keeping the momentum strong. The rise of boutique fitness and premium wellness clubs is also opening the door for more specialized offerings. Consumers are shifting toward a more integrated view of health — where fitness, nutrition, and mental well-being go hand in hand — creating multiple revenue streams for brands in the space. Companies like Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, Hims & Hers Health HIMS and DexCom DXCM are the leading players in this movement.For investors, this trend presents a compelling long-term opportunity. As wellness becomes a top priority for more consumers, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health services is expected to grow.

From fresh meats and dairy alternatives to vitamins and supplements, Sprouts offers lifestyle-focused choices. Its private-label Sprouts Brand has gained serious traction — generating over 23% of revenue in 2024 — by delivering exclusive, high-quality items at value-driven prices.Now operating 440 stores across 24 states, Sprouts continues to expand with a focus on smaller-format locations that bring fresh, premium food closer to communities. A key part of its strategy lies in logistics: the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is optimizing its supply chain by placing distribution hubs within 250 miles of most stores. This boosts produce freshness and supports local sourcing. At the same time, Sprouts is leaning into digital innovation with app-based ordering, delivery options, and personalized marketing, all contributing to a seamless omnichannel shopping experience.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sustainability is more than a buzzword for Sprouts — it’s woven into the company’s mission. In 2024, organic products made up 30% of total sales, while plant-based offerings climbed 27%. The company continues to prioritize responsible sourcing, food waste reduction, and carbon footprint management. Through its Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation, over $35 million has been invested since 2015 in nutrition education and food access programs. By combining eco-conscious practices with a commitment to health and wellness, Sprouts is reinforcing its role as a go-to grocer for mindful consumers. Hims & Hers Health has steadily evolved into a broad-based digital health and wellness platform, offering personalized solutions for conditions like hair loss, mental health, dermatology, weight loss, and sexual wellness. Their services are primarily delivered via telehealth, where customers access licensed providers through the company’s platform. These providers prescribe medications—both branded and compounded — which are fulfilled through Hims & Hers-affiliated pharmacies. In addition to prescription products, the company also offers over-the-counter health, skincare, and supplement items, many under their own brand, available online or through retail partnerships.Hims & Hers’ fitness and wellness offerings have expanded significantly in recent years, with notable moves into weight management. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company launched compounded semaglutide in mid-2024 and later added branded versions, tying into its broader telehealth weight loss program. New capabilities like a peptide manufacturing facility and a lab testing business (acquired in early 2025) aim to support long-term growth in this segment. These additions enhance their ability to provide medically-backed, personalized treatments for conditions such as obesity, testosterone imbalance, and sleep disorders — areas often tied to physical fitness and overall well-being.Underlying this expansion is a scalable tech platform that supports recurring subscription models and end-to-end care, from virtual consultation to medication delivery. Their approach reduces barriers like stigma and access limitations, particularly for first-time healthcare seekers. The platform’s structure allows Hims & Hers to respond quickly to growing demand for lifestyle-related care, positioning the company as a consumer-first health partner with a strong foothold in the digital fitness and wellness space.DexCom ’s health and fitness-related business centers around continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems designed to support people managing diabetes and those focused on improving metabolic health. Its core products — G6, G7, and the newly launched Stelo biosensor — offer real-time glucose tracking, mobile connectivity, and seamless data sharing via wearables like Apple Watch. The G7 system, with a smaller sensor and faster warm-up time, offers advanced alerts and an intuitive mobile app, while the over-the-counter Stelo targets adults with prediabetes and non-insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, broadening Dexcom’s reach into wellness and preventive care.Over the years, Dexcom has expanded beyond insulin-dependent users through strategic product development and partnerships. Its CGM systems are now integrated with insulin pumps and smart pens, allowing for semi-automated insulin delivery. More recently, Dexcom has collaborated with digital health players and consumer technology brands to make CGM data available in fitness platforms, extending usage beyond clinical diabetes management.

Forget the U.S. Downgrade. Here's What Really Matters to the Market. — Barrons.com,1747691580000,"By Ian SalisburyMoody's downgrade to the U.S.'s credit rating initially shook the market as it kicked off the week.The S&P 500 was down early Monday, before recovering to finish up 0.1%, as investors reacted to the firm's recent decision to strip U.S. sovereign debt of its triple-A credit rating.While psychologically jarring, history suggests the downgrade will have little impact on stock returns in the longer term. Instead, investors should focus on corporate earnings.""The history of U.S. sovereign debt rating agency downgrades spans +10 years and uniformly shows that these actions do not portend higher rates, recession, or lower stock prices,"" wrote DataTrek analyst Nicholas Colas in a note Monday. ""Over the last 20 years, 10-year Treasury yields were highest when America was AAA rated by all three agencies,""Indeed, Colas noted Standard & Poor's cut its rating on U.S. debt all the way back in 2011, and Fitch did so in 2023. Neither move ultimately scared investors away from Treasury bonds, which remained capital markets ultimate safe haven. Meanwhile the S&P 500 has enjoyed one of its best stretches in recent memory.A better way to gauge where stocks are headed may simply be to focus on corporate profits. There has been cause for worry there too, noted Morgan Stanley analyst Michael J. Wilson in a Monday note, but the picture is improving. One of Wilson's preferred gauges is ""earnings revision breadth,"" a sentiment measure which compares the number of downward earnings revisions issued by Wall Street stock analysts to upward ones.While the earnings revision breadth measure is still bearish, it's improved dramatically in the past few weeks. Wilson notes that breadth for the S&P 500 is now at -15%, up from a low of -25% in mid-April. If that trend continues, the S&P 500 could approach its mid-February highs.""The combination of upside momentum in revisions breadth and last week's deal with China has placed the S&P 500 firmly back in our pre-Liberation Day range of 5500-6100,"" Wilson wrote. ""We think continued upward progress in EPS revisions breadth back toward 0% will be needed to break through 6100 on the upside.""The S&P 500 hit its all-time high of 6144 on Feb. 19Among the sectors that have enjoyed the biggest rebounds are media and entertainment, materials, capital goods and tech hardware. By contrast, laggards with worsening outlooks include consumer durables, autos and consumer services.Citi analysts, for their part, are also bearish on consumer stocks, worrying about recent signs that spending by American consumers is slowing. On Friday, the University of Michigan reported its consumer sentiment index slipped to 50.8, its second-lowest reading in more than 40 years.""We have been [underweight] consumer discretionary and staples stocks this year as the U.S. consumer has been in the crosshairs of tariff policy risk,"" analysts wrote Friday. ""A worst-case policy impact has seemingly been alleviated, yet recent signs of consumer slowing are concerning.""Citi analysis recommended investors who do want to own consumer stocks pick and choose, with an emphasis on defensive names. To that end, they ran a screen hunting for individual stocks, with low cyclicality, high debt-to-capital ratios and high capital expenditures relative to deprecation.Among the names that came up: Walmart, Dollar Tree, Amazon and Procter & Gamble.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Amazon Commits $5 Billion on Saudi AI zone,1747226893000,"Amazon's NASDAQ:AMZN AWS is teaming up with Saudi startup Humain to roll out its AI servers, UltraCluster high-speed networks and Amazon Q app services throughout the Kingdom's new AI Zonethink state-of-the-art cloud power on Saudi soil. This follows AWS plowing $4 billion into Chile and underscores Amazon's playbook of planting local cloud and AI flagpoles in fast-growing markets. Saudi ICT minister Eng. Abdullah Alswaha called it the foundation for the intelligent era, and with AWS gear sitting in Humain's data centers plus joint training bootcamps for thousands of Saudi developers, it's clear both sides want to build an AI talent pipeline as big as the desert.But hey, all that swagger comes at a price.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, SoundHound AI, Amazon.com and Alphabet",1747226220000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 14, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, SoundHound AI, Inc. SOUN, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?NVIDIA Corp. and SoundHound AI, Inc . have made significant inroads in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, boosting their stock prices over the last year. Both are targeting distinct AI segments, so let’s determine the one with greater gains.The Bullish Case for SOUN StockThe temporary trade agreement between the United States and China is good news for SoundHound AI stock. Tariffs on Chinese imports are lowered to 30% from 145%, and China has reduced the import duty on American commodities to 10% from 125%. The 90-day truce benefited companies with trade in the United States and China.Thanks to the deal with Tencent, SoundHound AI now operates in China. Tencent will integrate SoundHound’s voice AI into its cloud solutions for the automotive sector. As a software company, SoundHound AI may not be directly affected by tariffs; however, its cost of doing business rises significantly. Moreover, if tensions escalate, SoundHound AI may be blacklisted by China, impacting its partnership with Tencent.As more enterprise customers use SoundHound AI’s platforms, the company’s first-quarter 2025 revenues jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss in the first quarter narrowed by 14%. The company finished the quarter with positive cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. For full-year 2025, the company aims for 85% to 90% revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA.The Bullish Case for NVDA StockNVIDIA is poised to gain from the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alphabet Inc. These cloud computing companies are acquiring NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to boost computing power for AI workloads. Alphabet, in particular, said that growth from its AI products in the latest reported quarter was much higher than that of Google Cloud.By 2028, NVIDIA forecasts AI data center spending to hit $1 trillion, fueling stock growth. NVIDIA’s advanced chips are also in high demand, with shipments of its latest cutting-edge new-generation Blackwell chips surging by the day due to their faster AI interface and improved energy efficiency. Additionally, the popularity of the CUDA software platform has increased among developers and is expected to improve NVIDIA’s quarterly performance (read more: Can Palantir Stock be the Next NVIDIA, and Is It Worth Buying?).NVIDIA or SoundHound AI: Which Stock Has Greater Gain Potential?No doubt, the latest trade deal and widespread adoption of SoundHound’s voice-enabled AI systems are positives for the stock. However, the company is simply growing through acquisitions and less organically. If diverse corporate cultures don’t seamlessly blend, then it can be a hindrance to SoundHound AI’s growth story.SoundHound AI isn’t profitable yet and has often failed to meet its guidance, impacting the stock’s growth. Despite issuing positive EBITDA guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company’s adjusted EBITDA remained a negative $22.2 million five quarters later. On the other hand, NVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than the Semiconductor - General industry, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, higher than the industry’s 49.5%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has more room to scale upward.Furthermore, SoundHound AI lacks a competitive edge like NVIDIA has with GPUs. NVIDIA’s more than 80% market share in the GPU space will help the stock sustain market volatility, which could pose challenges for SoundHound AI. This indicates, NVIDIA can offer better and consistent gains in the near future. For now, both NVIDIA and SoundHound AI have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here .Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"US Chip, Software Giants Enter 'Watershed Moment' in AI Shift to Mideast, Wedbush Says",1747668681000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and other US semiconductor and software giants face a ""watershed moment"" as the artificial intelligence revolution expands to the Middle East, Wedbush Securities said Monday in a note. ""The market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names,"" Wedbush said. President Donald Trump's Middle East trip culminated in deals for the delivery of 18,000 Nvidia chips to Saudi Arabia for a 500-megawatt data center and for the largest AI data center outside the US in Abu Dhabi, the report said.

The tech boom in the Middle East ""also speaks to this global game of high stakes poker being played by the Trump administration"" as China faces US chip restrictions, the report said.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights C3.ai, UiPath, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",1747225740000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 14, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: C3.ai, Inc. AI, UiPath Inc. PATH, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:C3.ai or UiPath: Which AI Automation Stock Is the Better Buy Right Now?C3.ai, Inc. and UiPath Inc . are both high-profile players in the booming AI automation sector. C3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications, including predictive maintenance and generative AI tools, while UiPath leads in robotic process automation and is evolving toward “agentic AI” solutions. Both companies have seen recent momentum amid the broader artificial intelligence hype. In 2025, each presents a distinct case: C3.ai is smaller but growing faster, whereas UiPath is larger with more stable financials.These companies stand at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing trends—AI and digital transformation—making them compelling candidates for investors eyeing long-term technology disruption. Recent volatility in both stocks, coupled with evolving enterprise spending patterns and new product developments, has reignited interest in evaluating their investment potential. With macroeconomic uncertainty pressuring tech valuations and AI narratives driving short-term sentiment, now is an opportune time to assess which stock holds more promise.Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is the better investment at present.The Case for C3.ai StockC3.ai markets itself as an enterprise AI pure play, offering a suite of prebuilt, configurable AI applications that help large organizations implement predictive analytics, detect anomalies, and optimize operations. In theory, this makes its platform highly scalable across sectors. C3.ai has positioned itself as a pure-play enterprise AI software company, offering a broad portfolio of over 100 pre-built AI applications across various industries, including energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Central to the company’s growth strategy is its deepening alignment with major cloud providers and government institutions, designed to accelerate go-to-market efforts and extend distribution scale.C3.ai’s strengths center on its leadership in enterprise AI. The company claims first-mover status in “model-driven” AI applications, having expanded across numerous industries (19 in total) and the U.S. federal government, where federal revenues grew more than 100% in fiscal 2024. The company has secured large customers and pilots — recent announced deals include oil & gas supermajors, the U.S. Navy, BASF and multiple state/local governments. Strategic partnerships bolster C3.ai’s reach.For example, C3.ai is the most sought-after AI application on Microsoft ’s Azure cloud marketplace. It has a tie-up with Alphabet ’s Google Cloud and Amazon ’s Amazon Web Services. Since announcing an expanded alliance with Microsoft in late 2024, C3.ai closed 28 new deals through joint engagements, spanning nine industries. Sales cycles withMicrosoft have shortened by approximately 20%, a testament to the strength of their joint go-to-market motions. As of the fiscal third-quarter end, C3.ai and Microsoft were engaged in more than 600 active enterprise opportunities globally. These factors suggest that there will be continued opportunities as companies seek AI tools to streamline processes and decision-making.In its fiscal third-quarter results, C3.ai reported total revenues of $98.8 million, marking a 26% increase year over year. Subscription revenues grew 22% year over year to $85.7 million, constituting 87% of total revenues. The company closed 66 agreements, including 50 pilots, a 72% increase year over year.C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non GAAP loss of 12 cents per share). The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.Although cash reserves are large ($724.3 million at the fiscal third-quarter end), continued losses raise the risk of dilution or spending pressure. Competition is fierce – from other AI startups to tech giants building in-house AI solutions, which could pressure C3.ai’s growth or pricing. Growth also appears to be moderating after a surge in activity. Revenue growth rate decreased from 29% in the fiscal second quarter to 26% in the fiscal third quarter.The Case for UiPath StockUiPath operates in the adjacent, yet distinct, space of robotic process automation. Its platform automates rule-based, repetitive digital tasks—freeing up human workers and reducing costs for businesses. In contrast to C3.ai’s focus on predictive analytics and machine learning, UiPath emphasizes process optimization, task mining, and digital workflow orchestration. This has enabled it to gain broad adoption across banking, insurance, healthcare, and public sector clients.UiPath’s strengths lie in its market leadership and innovation. UiPath has a large global customer base and high retention (net retention approximately 110–115%), meaning existing accounts keep expanding. Management notes that 90% of surveyed enterprises see opportunities for agentic AI in their workflows, suggesting a large addressable market ahead. Furthermore, UiPath enjoys very high gross margins (85% non-GAAP in the fiscal fourth quarter) and has been streamlining its cost structure, supporting improved profitability.UiPath’s business and financial profile contrast sharply with C3.ai’s. UiPath is much larger and has recently been moving toward profitability. In fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31, 2025), UiPath reported revenues of $1.43 billion, up 9% year over year. In the fiscal fourth quarter (October 2024–January 2025), revenues were $424 million (up 5%). Its subscription and recurring model yields stable bookings — year-end Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $1.666 billion (up 14%).Crucially, UiPath generated a GAAP operating profit of $34 million in the fiscal fourth quarter (versus a year-ago loss) and $241 million of non-GAAP operating income for the full year. Free cash flow was robust, reaching $328 million in fiscal 2025. The company ended the year with about $1.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet and launched a $500 million share buyback program, announced during the fiscal second quarter. These figures point to a healthy, cash-generative model, despite modest growth.On the other hand, UiPath faces challenges. Its revenue growth rate has slowed to mid-single digits (10% in the fiscal second quarter, 9% in the fiscal third quarter, 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter) as large enterprises moderate spending. Global economic uncertainty — especially in the U.S. public sector — has pressured guidance. Competition is fierce: Microsoft (Power Automate), Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and even open-source tools vie for the automation market. UiPath remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis for the year (fiscal 2025 GAAP operating loss was $163 million), though it expects to sustain profitability going forward.Share Price Performance & Valuations for C3.ai, UiPath StocksPATH (up 3%) has performed better than AI (down 29.7%) so far in 2025. Over the past month, PATH has gained 22.2%, more than AI’s 20.6% rally.ValuationC3.ai is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7X, below its three-year median of 8.33X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 5.74X. PATH’s forward earnings multiple sits at 4.63X, below its three-year median of 6.41X. The C3.ai stock appears expensive when compared with the sector average and PATH.While both companies operate in the AI automation space, UiPath's valuation metrics suggest a more balanced investment profile, with expectations of future profitability and valuations in line with industry norms. C3.ai carries a higher valuation premium and lacks current profitability, which may present greater investment risk.Comparing EPS Projections: C3.ai & UiPathThe 2025 EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days for PATH stock while the same remained unchanged for C3.ai. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C3.ai’s 2025 bottom line suggests a 4.3% improvement, while that for PATH indicates a year-over-year decline of 1.9%.ConclusionBoth C3.ai and UiPath are positioned to benefit from the continued interest in AI-driven automation, but their risk/reward profiles differ. C3.ai offers higher growth potential, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicating 29.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, and first-mover advantages in the enterprise AI market. However, it is still unprofitable, burning cash. In contrast, UiPath is larger and almost cash-flow positive. It generates profits on a non-GAAP basis, boasts a strong balance sheet, and recently returned capital via a $500 million buyback.In a nutshell, C3.ai’s upside depends on sustaining rapid growth and successfully scaling new AI offerings, which is far from certain, given competition and macro risks. UiPath, while growing more slowly, has a more proven business model and valuation that is easier to justify. UiPath — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company - appears to offer better upside potential in 2025.Its combination of profitability, strong cash flow, and reasonable valuation makes it more resilient if growth disappoints. C3.ai — a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company — could outperform on strong AI tailwinds, but it is riskier and richly priced.

3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell Snowflake Stock Before Q1 Earnings?",1747664100000,"Snowflake SNOW is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 21.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 21.13%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating 57.14% year-over-year growth.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing once, the average earnings surprise being 28.04%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

UBER vs. GRAB: Which Ride-Hailing Stock is a Stronger Play Now?,1747663860000,"Uber Technologies UBER and Grab GRAB both provide ride-hailing services. The companies have revolutionized the transportation industry with their innovative business models centered on ride-sharing.However, the companies operate in different regions and have distinct approaches. While Uber operates globally, Grab is a leading provider of deliveries, mobility and digital financial services sectors in multiple cities across eight countries in Southeast Asia — Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Even though Uber’s primary business is ride-sharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time.Given this difference in approaches and geographical focus of the two companies, let’s examine closely to find out which one currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now.The Case for UberUber is based in San Francisco, CA. Uber’s ridesharing and delivery platforms are growing in popularity. This is generating strong demand, which, along with the latest growth initiatives and continued cost discipline, is driving the company’s results.In its recently released first-quarter 2025 results, Uber continued its streak of beating earnings expectations, showing resilience despite tough conditions.Uber Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUber price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Uber QuoteIn the June quarter, gross bookings are anticipated to be in the $45.75 billion - $47.25 billion range, indicating 16-20% growth on a constant currency basis from second-quarter 2024 actuals. The guidance includes an estimated 1.5 percentage point impact of currency headwind (including a roughly 3 percentage point currency headwind to Mobility).Earnings Estimates for UberUber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. By adopting this approach, Uber has been able to avoid the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. Moreover, Uber has engaged in numerous acquisitions, geographic and product diversifications, and innovations. Its endeavors to expand into international markets are commendable and provide it with the benefits of geographical diversification.Another area of confidence is Uber’s buyback strategy. In 2024, Uber generated a record $6.9 billion in free cash flow, with an adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Uber’s announcement to start an accelerated $1.5 billion stock buyback program highlights not only its shareholder-friendly strategy but also signals confidence in its ongoing business strategy. The $1.5 billion plan is part of the company's $7 billion buyback program announced last year.In 2018, Uber, which went public in 2019, sold its business in Southeast Asia to Grab. Uber has a significant stake in Grab.The Case for GrabGrab's ability to adapt to local conditions is a key contributor to its success in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Grab’s evolution from a taxi-hailing app into an ""everyday everything app"" offering various services, including food delivery, e-scooter rentals and digital payments, is commendable and highlights its desire to expand. Grab is benefiting from strong growth in its On-Demand Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”), expanding fintech offerings, and increasing user engagement across its platform. On-demand GMV refers to the sum of GMV of the mobility and deliveries segments. In the first quarter of 2025, On-Demand GMV increased 16% year over year. Grab expects 2025 revenues between $3.33 billion and $3.40 billion, indicating 19-22% year-over-year growth. Grab Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGrab price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Grab QuoteGrab is strengthening its position across Southeast Asia by partnering with  Amazon ’s AMZN cloud computing platform — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — to drive growth in mobility, deliveries and financial services.In December 2024, Grab selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate growth across its mobility, deliveries, and financial services verticals, including its digital banks. Grab has enhanced operational efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs and launched innovative services by utilizing AWS’ scalable, secure and cost-efficient cloud solutions.Earnings Estimates for GrabGrab Appears to Be More Pricey Than UberUber is trading at a forward sales multiple of 3.58, above its median of 2.54 over the last three years. Uber has a Value Score of D. Meanwhile, Grab has a Value Score of F, with its forward sales multiple at 5.78, above its 3-year median of 4.85.ConclusionUber’s expensive valuation (compared to its 3-year median) seems to suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for this dominant player in the ride-hailing industry. The company’s diversification efforts and shareholder-friendly approach attest to its financial bliss. Uber’s large size (market capitalization of $191.95 billion) positions it well to overcome uncertain times, such as the current one.Grab, on the other hand, has a much narrower geographical focus, making it highly susceptible to economic downturns, such as the current scenario. The economic uncertainty in key Southeast Asia markets, driven by factors like inflation, changing consumer behavior, and supply-chain disruptions, is hurting Grab. Moreover, Grab faces intense competition in its deliveries segment. The much smaller Grab, with a market capitalization of $20.5 billion, is not as shareholder-friendly, as its larger rival.On the basis of our analysis, Uber seems a better pick than Grab, despite both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfb690819094b:0-uber-vs-grab-which-ride-hailing-stock-is-a-stronger-play-now/

Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a0f366036094b:0-should-you-stay-invested-in-or-sell-coreweave-stock-post-q1-earnings/

Bear of the Day: United Parcel Service (UPS),1747641600000,"UPS Company OverviewBased in Atlanta, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock United Parcel Service ( UPS ) is the world’s largest express carrier and package delivery company. Founded in 1907, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. The company offers a range of supply chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions, and repairs. UPS transports millions of packages each business day across the globe. In 2024, the company delivered 22.4 million packages per day on average.UPS to Slash Amazon Business in HalfE-commerce juggernaut Amazon ( AMZN ) is UPS’s largest customer by far in terms of volume and revenue. Unfortunately for UPS, UPS Amazon deliveries are also some of the least profitable sides of the business, with tiny margins. Facing a dilemma, UPS management decided earlier this year to cut its Amazon delivery volume by more than 50% by the end of next year. While the bold move may reduce UPS’s reliance on Amazon and increase margins, it will be near-impossible to fill the gigantic volume void any time soon, leaving shareholders with more questions than answers.Weakness in Europe and Asia Persists Geopolitical uncertainty, global trade concerns, and poor consumer sentiment continue to contribute to the economic slowdown and slowing demand for UPS in Asia and Europe. With all the uncertainty, UPS forward guidance forecasts that revenue will be lower in 2025 in 2024.Unionization Means Higher CostsUPS is the largest employer of members of the “Teamsters” union. After a strike, UPS was forced to increase full-time workers’ pay significantly by $7.50 per hour. This deal has hurt the company’s profitability dramatically, and when the agreement ends in 2028, UPS is likely to have to increase pay even more or face another strike.Relative Price Weakness Versus the MarketRelative weakness is another major red flag for UPS. Year-to-date, shares are down 19.7% while the S&P 500 Index is down only 3.4%. In other words, UPS shares fell in tandem with the market but failed to recover with it.Bottom LineUPS faces significant headwinds as it navigates a complex landscape marked by a significant shift in its Amazon relationship, persistent weakness in key international markets, and increasing labor costs.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2666b3503094b:0-bear-of-the-day-united-parcel-service-ups/

On top of the 20 billion euros in new investments, Macron also announced some 20 billion euros worth of AI-focused projects pledged at a Paris AI summit in February.""You delivered a lot of investments in different fields: AI, telco, ... green hydrogen, and circular economy ... this is a very complete edition where 20 billion were invested, and 20 billion of AI investments as a follow-up to the summit in February,"" Macron told CEOs and entrepreneurs in Versailles. Among the pledges made ahead of the summit, U.S. logistics giant Prologis is set to invest 6.4 billion euros in four data centres in the Paris region, while London-based fintech Revolut plans to invest 1 billion euros over the next three years on expanding in France and will apply for a French banking licence.Announcements also came from the United Arab Emirates' AI-focused MGX fund and others were expected from companies ranging from Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN to Britain's Less Common Metals Limited in the rare earth sector.

""There isn't a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the (consumer price index) in April, but this shouldn't be surprising as it takes time,"" Oxford Economics said.

Stephanie Link reveals her favourite retail stocks after April inflation data,1747487700000,"US retail stocks are in focus this week after the Bureau of Labour Statistics said that inflation was up slightly less-than-expected in April.Inflation data tends to be significant for retail stocks as it directly influences consumer purchasing power and overall business costs.According to Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist, a handful of the US retail stocks are particularly well-positioned to own after April’s CPI reading.Her top picks include Walmart, Amazon, and Costco.Walmart Inc NYSE:WMTWalmart missed revenue expectations in its fiscal first quarter and warned this week that it will begin raising prices in response to tariffs. The company cited increased import costs stemming from the US administration’s trade policies and indicated that consumers could start seeing the impact as early as the end of May.Still, Stephanie Link remains bullish as ever on the retail giant as a 4.5% increase in same-store sales in the US suggests “they’re crushing it.” Plus, the NYSE-listed firm is “being conservative on guidance,” she added.Link sees WMT as strongly positioned to absorb the tariffs-driven costs, thanks to its fortress of a balance sheet. On CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, she dubbed Walmart an all-weather stock as 72% of its sales come from consumables.Finally, a close to 1% dividend yield tied to WMT shares makes them all the more exciting to own in 2025.Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ:AMZNHightower’s chief investment strategist favours owning Amazon for retail exposure this year since it continues to grow its market share in eCommerce and has a strong presence globally.According to Stephanie Link, Amazon’s scale positions it well to absorb tariff-related increases in costs. This could even help insulate the multinational from rising competition from the likes of Temu and Shein.All in all, if the US economy “continues to chug along and the consumer doesn’t die,” investors will remain interested in Amazon stock in 2025, she argued in a recent interview.Note that AMZN shares are currently down more than 15% versus their year-to-date high, which makes them appealing in terms of valuation as well.Costco Wholesale Corp NASDAQ:COSTStephanie Link counts Costco stock among her top picks for 2025 as it’s exceptionally positioned to navigate an uncertain macro environment.She recommends owning COST this year for the strength of its membership model, as it’s known to drive customer loyalty that translates to consistent revenue streams.Additionally, the retail behemoth’s efficient supply chain and bulk pricing strategy help it maintain profitability even in challenging economic conditions. Like Walmart, Costco is a dividend-paying stock, currently offering a yield of 0.51%—another compelling reason to consider adding it to your portfolio.Wall Street agrees with Link on Costco stock as well, given the consensus rating currently sits at “overweight” with price targets going as high as $1,205, indicating potential upside of more than 20% from current levels.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:ae1d87a4c094b:0-stephanie-link-reveals-her-favourite-retail-stocks-after-april-inflation-data/

"In a Trade War, Walmart Lacks Some of Amazon's Ammunition — Heard on the Street — WSJ",1747474200000,"By Dan GallagherTwo American retail titans are on the front lines in President Trump's trade war. Investors seem to be betting that Walmart can dodge even more bullets than Amazon.Walmart used its fiscal first-quarter report on Thursday to warn that its prices are going up as products covered by new tariffs start hitting its shelves. That marred what was otherwise considered a strong report, with revenue rising nearly 3% from the same period last year and operating earnings exceeding Wall Street's forecasts.Wall Street doesn't seem too worried. Walmart's stock sold off sharply Thursday morning but quickly recovered. It has now risen nearly 2% since reporting earnings, putting it up around 53% over the past 12 months — well ahead of other retailers and trouncing Amazon's 12% gain over the same period.That has landed Walmart — the home of ""Always Low Prices"" — a rather rich multiple of 37 times projected earnings for the next four quarters, which is 40% above its three-year average, according to FactSet data. Amazon now trades around 33 times forward earnings.Such a premium leaves Walmart very little room for error in a world where so much can go wrong. Walmart noted Thursday that more than two-thirds of the goods it sells in U.S. stores come from the U.S. ""But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on the company's earnings call.""Narrow retail margins"" are a challenge for Amazon as well. But the company has spent many years building up ancillary and adjacent businesses such as cloud computing and advertising that provide far more financial firepower.That shows in the companies' respective income statements. Amazon and Walmart commanded similar gross margins in the mid-20% range a little over a decade ago, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Walmart's has stayed in that range, while Amazon's annual gross margin has nearly doubled — hitting 49% last year.To be sure, Walmart has done a commendable job of becoming more than just an enormous physical retailer. E-commerce revenue hit $32.5 billion in the April-ending quarter, up 22% from the same period last year and now making up 20% of the company's total sales. That has allowed Walmart to follow in Amazon's footsteps and build up new, higher-margin revenue streams from subscriber fees and advertising. Bernstein analyst Zhihan Ma says Walmart is on a ""fundamentally improved"" earnings trajectory over the long term.But Amazon is much further along that path. Note that while both companies are projected to hit roughly $700 billion in revenue this year, Wall Street expects Amazon's operating income to come in around 2 1/2 times that of Walmart's at more than $77 billion for Amazon, according to FactSet estimates.And that is even after factoring in the costs of Amazon's aggressive artificial intelligence investments and the launch of its own satellite network. These businesses are also less tied to the overall retail environment than Walmart's ancillary businesses such as advertising, making them a better hedge against tariff chaos.Walmart's scale and execution give it a distinct edge over other traditional retailers in an environment of rising prices and worried consumers. But beating Amazon at its own game is still a ways off.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250517000550:0/

Break Up Alphabet? It May Be the 'Only Way Forward' for Google Stock. — Barrons.com,1747167420000,"Al RootAlphabet faces regulatory and competitive headwinds weighing on the company's valuation. It might be time to break the tech giant up to ""unleash"" shareholder value.""The only way forward for Alphabet is a complete breakup that would allow investors to own the business they actually want — the top competitors to Netflix, Amazon Web Services/ Microsoft Azure, Trade Desk, and Uber/ Tesla,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in a Monday report.Alphabet, of course, is a conglomeration of many tech businesses, including Google Search, Waymo, Google Cloud, YouTube, and others. Alphabet has the Android operating system, its own foundational AI models, and designs AI chips that work with Nvidia processors.Google makes most of its money via advertising, which is why Luria included Trade Desk, which trades at about 45 times estimated 2025 earnings. YouTube competes for eyeballs with Netflix, which trades for 43 times estimated 2025 earnings. Waymo is pioneering self-driving taxi service like Tesla, which trades for about 150 times earnings. Cloud companies Microsoft and Amazon.com trade for about 32 times and 34 times earnings, respectively. Apple and Nvidia shares trade for closer to 28 times earnings.All of those multiples are far greater than Alphabet's 17 times multiple. The biggest reason for the discount is essentially OpenAI and its ChatGPT, which threatens the search business. Alphabet, of course, is responding with its Gemini product and AI summaries in the traditional search results.""The debate on search will not get better, and sum of the parts [valuation] only works if the company is willing to take action,"" added Luria. ""Investors want a big-bang breakup, not isolated spin-offs.""That is the key to unleashing higher valuation, he says. ""By keeping the conglomerate structure, management in dooming all of its businesses to the 16 times search multiple.""A big breakup is a bold idea. Whether the company will undertake it is anyone's guess. Alphabet didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Luria isn't the only one who thinks a breakup could help Alphabet. ""Google's true value is suffocating under its own scale,"" says The Edge research founder Jim Osman, whose firm specializes in analyzing spinoffs. ""Break it right, and YouTube, Cloud, and Waymo could each command a multiple the market isn't currently allowed to see. Great spin-offs create value long-term, but chaos often comes first.""Osman doesn't have a rating on Alphabet stock. Luria rates shares Hold, with a $160 price target for shares, but adds a breakup would make it a ""top megacap pick.""Overall, 84% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy, according to FactSet. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Alphabet shares is about $200.Alphabet stock rose 0.6% on Tuesday, closing at $159.93, while the S&P 500 added 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%.

Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

"The Score: UnitedHealth, Walmart, Coinbase Global and More Stocks That Moved on the Week's News — WSJ",1747430220000,"By Francesca FontanaThe Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them.UnitedHealthUnitedHealth suffered a stock meltdown this past week.The Justice Department is investigating the healthcare conglomerate — and parent of insurance giant UnitedHealthcare — for possible criminal Medicare fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.The criminal probe adds to a list of government inquiries into UnitedHealth, including antitrust investigations and a civil investigation of its Medicare billing practices that The Wall Street Journal first reported in February.UnitedHealth said it hadn't been notified by the Justice Department of the criminal investigation and stands by the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.Earlier in the week, UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 earnings financial outlook, and announced the sudden resignation of Chief Executive Andrew Witty. Witty stepped down for ""personal reasons,"" replaced by Chairman and former CEO Stephen Hemsley.UnitedHealth shares sank 18% Tuesday, and on Thursday fell 11%.Amazon.comTo the surprise of investors and businesses around the world, the U.S. and China made a deal on trade.The two countries agreed to a 90-day trade deal that slashed tariffs between the two countries and sent stocks surging — including the biggest U.S. tech stocks whose operations depend on China.Online retail giant Amazon, for one, sells many Chinese-made products. Many of Amazon's third-party sellers source their products from the country, and independent merchants warned that prices could skyrocket if tariffs continued. Some had said their businesses would cease operations.Amazon shares gained 8.1% Monday.BoeingBoeing shares gained some air on the surprise trade truce between the U.S. and China.As part of the deal to temporarily roll back tariffs, China scrapped an earlier ban on Boeing's airplanes. Beijing told Chinese airlines that they can resume taking delivery on pre-existing jet orders.The government last month told Chinese carriers they had to seek additional approval before taking delivery of Boeing aircraft they had already ordered, in effect halting deliveries to one of Boeing's biggest markets.The U.S. jet maker also benefited from the recent trade deal struck between the U.S. and the U.K., with British Airways purchasing 32 Boeing aircraft.Boeing shares gained 2.5% Tuesday.Foot LockerDick's Sporting Goods is taking over Foot Locker.In a deal announced Thursday morning, big-box retailer Dick's agreed to buy the sneaker company for roughly $2.4 billion.Dick's said it expects to operate Foot Locker as a stand-alone business unit within its portfolio and maintain the Foot Locker brands.Foot Locker's shares had slumped this year on Trump's tariff plans, which upended supply chains and costs for retailers and sneaker companies.The deal follows the recent sneaker buyout of Skechers, which agreed to sell itself for $9.4 billion to private-equity firm 3G Capital.Foot Locker shares soared 86% Thursday, while Dick's shares dropped 15%.WalmartTariff-related price hikes are coming to Walmart.While its quarterly sales were strong, the U.S. retail behemoth said that it plans to raise prices this month and early this summer. Tariffs have already driven up the prices of some of Walmart's goods — such as bananas at 54 cents a pound, up from 50 cents, according to Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey.Many companies have already announced price increases, and other retailers are likely to follow suit. Later this month, Target, Lowe's and Home Depot will report earnings and discuss their financial forecasts.Walmart didn't share a profit forecast for the current quarter, in part because the company may absorb some tariff costs to keep prices lower than competitors, Rainey said.Walmart shares dipped 0.5% Thursday.Coinbase GlobalThe largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange said it refused to pay a $20 million ransom demand from cybercriminals that stole sensitive customer data.Coinbase said the criminals bribed the company's overseas customer support agents to steal the data, which includes names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.In a regulatory filing, the company estimated that the incident could cost from $180 million to $400 million.The breach is a setback for Coinbase — which is slated to join the S&P 500 later this month — and threatens its cultivated reputation for safety. The company has largely avoided the hacks and heists suffered by many exchanges overseas.Coinbase shares fell 7.2% Thursday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

"Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains? ",1747162800000,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and SoundHound AI, Inc . SOUN have made significant inroads in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, boosting their stock prices over the last year. Both are targeting distinct AI segments, so let’s determine the one with greater gains. The Bullish Case for SOUN Stock The temporary trade agreement between the United States and China is good news for SoundHound AI stock. Tariffs on Chinese imports are lowered to 30% from 145%, and China has reduced the import duty on American commodities to 10% from 125%. The 90-day truce benefited companies with trade in the United States and China. Thanks to the deal with Tencent, SoundHound AI now operates in China. Tencent will integrate SoundHound’s voice AI into its cloud solutions for the automotive sector. As a software company, SoundHound AI may not be directly affected by tariffs; however, its cost of doing business rises significantly. Moreover, if tensions escalate, SoundHound AI may be blacklisted by China, impacting its partnership with Tencent. As more enterprise customers use SoundHound AI’s platforms, the company’s first-quarter 2025 revenues jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss in the first quarter narrowed by 14%. The company finished the quarter with positive cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. For full-year 2025, the company aims for 85% to 90% revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA. The Bullish Case for NVDA Stock NVIDIA is poised to gain from the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL. These cloud computing companies are acquiring NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to boost computing power for AI workloads. Alphabet, in particular, said that growth from its AI products in the latest reported quarter was much higher than that of Google Cloud. By 2028, NVIDIA forecasts AI data center spending to hit $1 trillion, fueling stock growth. NVIDIA’s advanced chips are also in high demand, with shipments of its latest cutting-edge new-generation Blackwell chips surging by the day due to their faster AI interface and improved energy efficiency. Additionally, the popularity of the CUDA software platform has increased among developers and is expected to improve NVIDIA’s quarterly performance (read more: Can Palantir Stock be the Next NVIDIA, and Is It Worth Buying?). NVIDIA or SoundHound AI: Which Stock Has Greater Gain Potential? No doubt, the latest trade deal and widespread adoption of SoundHound’s voice-enabled AI systems are positives for the stock. However, the company is simply growing through acquisitions and less organically. If diverse corporate cultures don’t seamlessly blend, then it can be a hindrance to SoundHound AI’s growth story. SoundHound AI isn’t profitable yet and has often failed to meet its guidance, impacting the stock’s growth. Despite issuing positive EBITDA guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company’s adjusted EBITDA remained a negative $22.2 million five quarters later. On the other hand, NVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than the Semiconductor - General industry, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, higher than the industry’s 49.5%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has more room to scale upward. Furthermore, SoundHound AI lacks a competitive edge like NVIDIA has with GPUs. NVIDIA’s more than 80% market share in the GPU space will help the stock sustain market volatility, which could pose challenges for SoundHound AI. This indicates, NVIDIA can offer better and consistent gains in the near future. For now, both NVIDIA and SoundHound AI have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e2a7aa4ba094b:0-which-ai-stock-nvidia-or-soundhound-ai-offers-better-gains/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Container ship owners swamped as US-China trade detente revives demand,1747424049000,"Container ship bookings for China-to-U.S. cargo have surged since the countries declared a 90-day truce on punitive tit-for-tat tariffs last weekend, operators said, spawning traffic jams at Chinese ports and factories that could take weeks to clear.U.S. importers of sneakers and sofas to construction supplies and auto parts are racing to get goods in before the deadline resets tariffs again, setting the stage for disruptions that recall the global transport quagmire during the COVID-19 pandemic.The cargo surge at major trade gateways like Shenzhen's Yantian Port, which handles more than a quarter of China's exports to the United States, has ship owners scrambling to coordinate berths and adjust vessel schedules.""The demand is so high that we can only serve customers who have made long-term contracts with us,"" a spokesperson for German container ship operator Hapag-Lloyd XETR:HLAG told Reuters. ""We have hardly enough space for spontaneous bookings."" Container-tracking software provider Vizion said average bookings for the seven days ended on Wednesday soared 277% to 21,530 20-foot equivalent units from the 5,709 TEU average for the week ended May 5.Owners of factories that make toys to holiday decor told Reuters they are booking previously frozen cargo headed to U.S. stores, including Walmart NYSE:WMT .Lalo, for example, which sells its baby furniture online and through retailers like Target NYSE:TGT and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , is among the companies that gave factories the green light to move their finished orders.""We had hundreds of thousands of units waiting to ship,"" said Lalo co-founder Michael Wieder. ""These products can now get on the water.""""Everybody is very busy from my company, at my friend's companies,"" said Richard Lee, CEO of NCL Logistics, in China's southern metropolis of Shenzhen. ""They are preparing a lot of cargo, a lot of products, to be shipped immediately from China to the U.S.""SECOND TSUNAMI?The shipping surge will translate into a rush of arrivals at U.S. West Coast ports in the coming weeks.Still, industry experts, including the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles - the busiest U.S. seaport and No. 1 for ocean shipments from China, do not foresee a COVID-level tsunami of cargo. Rather, they project a large, but manageable wave.On Thursday, the off-contract spot rate from Shanghai to Los Angeles shot up 16% from the prior week to $3,136 per 40-foot container, according to data from maritime consultancy Drewry. That is less than half than in April 2024, but could jump sharply on June 1 to about $6,000 per container if ship owners push through rate increases.In the early days of the pandemic, as now, cargo demand spikes overwhelmed factories and container ships, kinking supply chains. Shipping and retail experts said 90 days is not enough time for most factories to fill new orders. Fewer slots are available on cargo ships because vessel owners had been culling China-to-U.S. voyages and schedules. Now, ocean carriers are ""cancelling cancellations"" of sailings, Drewry said.Demand, however, is markedly different this time.Trump's second-term tariffs have weakened U.S. retail sales, homebuilding and manufacturing - key drivers of container shipments.Moreover, many U.S. companies are sitting on inventory accumulated before Trump imposed tariffs on China and other countries. And nobody knows what import duties will be when the 90-day deadline expires in August.The Trump administration confirmed to Reuters that the U.S. rate would reset to 54%, assuming no agreement is reached by the deadline.HIGH ANXIETYMany retailers are prioritizing which products to order and ship, said Jessica Dankert, vice president of supply chain for the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group, whose members include Home Depot NYSE:HD , Gap NYSE:GAP and Dollar General NYSE:DG .""It's still 30% at the end of the day,"" said Jamie Salter, CEO of Authentic Brands Group, referring to tariffs on China. Authentic Brands owns and licenses clothing brands including Reebok, Champion, and Forever 21.Some large suppliers to Detroit's Big Three automakers told Reuters that on customers' requests, they are flying in parts from China and stockpiling them.Others declined to add to inventories, saying they lacked the space and funds to do so.A Halloween goods exporter from the city of Yiwu in China, who gave her English name, Cecilia, said tariff increases have cut total orders in half this year and warned that prospective buyers are running out of time.""If you order now, you will have an anxious wait to see if it will be too late,"" she said.Jimmy Zollo, CEO at Joe and Bella, sells Chinese-made clothing for adults who have trouble dressing themselves due to arthritis, dementia or being in a wheelchair. He placed a new order with his supplier even though the 90-day window could close before he can take delivery.""We're hopeful that a new trade agreement is implemented, and the lowered tariffs do not expire,"" Zollo said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RN18D:0-container-ship-owners-swamped-as-us-china-trade-detente-revives-demand/"
Retailers Say Stockpiling Helped Mitigate 1Q Tariff Impacts — Market Talk,1747162320000,"Amazon.com, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Skechers and Fastenal are all among companies that have pulled forward orders and stockpiled inventory in an attempt to mitigate tariffs, Morgan Stanley analysts say in a research note. Amazon executives noted during the company's recent earnings call that was able to so far avoid widespread price increases thanks in part to forward buying by the company and its third-party sellers. And both Big 5 Sporting Goods and Skechers pointed to stockpiling as short-term solutions to tariffs that minimized tariff impacts during 1Q.

"FedEx strikes new Amazon deal, says heavy and rural deliveries are money makers",1747159920000,"By Tomi KilgoreFedEx's new deal comes nearly six years after its express business dropped Amazon, and about four months since archrival UPS cut its Amazon business in halfFedEx Corp. said that, following about a year of talks, it has a new delivery deal with Amazon.com Inc., which comes some five years after the two companies pared their delivery partnership.The deal also comes nearly four months after FedEx (FDX) rival United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said it was cutting its business with Amazon (AMZN) by more than half, because it wasn't profitable.FedEx assured investors that the business would make money, especially since the deliveries would be of the higher-margin variety - big and bulky, and to less populated places.""We would not go back to and open a deal after walking away five years ago if it did not make financial sense,"" said Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere, according to a FactSet transcript from a BofA Securities conference.FedEx did not provide details on how much the new deal would be worth. But when asked by BofA Securities analyst Ken Hoexter if the $5 billion in revenue UPS forfeited by cutting its Amazon business would instead go to FedEx, Carere said, ""It's not that, I am sure.""When Hoexter pressed as to the size of the contract, Carere just said: ""This will not be our largest customer. Period.""FedEx's stock slipped 0.3% in afternoon trading, while UPS shares shed 1.7% and Amazon's stock climbed 1.8%.The FedEx deal is not built on the notion of supplanting UPS, as Amazon noted that UPS remains a delivery partner. And more than two-thirds of Amazon's packages are now delivered in the U.S. via the company's own distribution network.""FedEx joins [Amazon's] other third-party partners, like UPS and the [U.S. Postal Service], that work alongside our own last-mile delivery network to help us balance capacity to best serve customers,"" Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement provided to MarketWatch.FedEx said in mid-2019 that it had decided not to renew its FedEx Express U.S. domestic delivery contract with Amazon, given poor returns from the deal.It's different this time, Carere said, because the deal is for ""heavy, hard-to-handle packages"" that she said FedEx can manage better than its competitors, and for rural areas, which can be valuable to FedEx if priced right.She also took a shot at rivals that have dropped rural deliveries. ""Business that is more difficult to move is where we get more value,"" Carere said. ""I really don't understand our primary competitors' need to pull back from rural. We've actually [won] business - [and] very profitable business - as a result.""FedEx's stock has dropped 17.5% in 2025, and UPS shares have shed 21.1%, while the S&P 500 index SPX has gained 0.3%.Read on: As the Dow and S&P claw back their 2025 losses, they're setting up for an extremely rare comeback victory-Tomi KilgoreThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Amazon.com is sued over alleged sale of contaminated rice,1748024869000,"Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN was sued on Friday by consumers over its alleged sale of a wide variety of rice contaminated by arsenic and other ""heavy metals.""The proposed class action in Seattle federal court covers 18 types of rice sold through Amazon, including from familiar brands such as Ben's Original and Amazon-owned Whole Foods' 365.""Amazon sold these rice products with alarmingly high levels of heavy metals to an intended consumer audience that includes children, with no warning whatsoever about the dangers of heavy metals,"" the complaint said.The lawsuit followed a study last week by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, a nonprofit that focuses on babies' exposure to toxic chemicals.That study found arsenic in all 145 rice samples purchased nationwide, with 28% exceeding a U.S. Food and Drug Administration limit for infant rice cereal.It also found cadmium in all but one sample, and lead and mercury in more than one-third of tested samples.Amazon, based in Seattle, had no immediate comment.Exposure to heavy metals has been associated with negative health effects such as nervous system problems, immune system suppression and kidney damage, and autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children.The 18 rice products include two from Ben's Original and three with the 365 label.Plaintiffs Ashley Wright and Merriman Blum said they would not have bought or would have paid less for Iberia Basmati 100% Aged Original rice, one of the products, if they knew the rice was contaminated or Amazon never tested it for heavy metals.Friday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages of at least $5 million for Amazon's alleged violations of Washington state consumer protection laws.Makers of baby food and dark chocolate have also faced many consumer lawsuits over the alleged presence of heavy metals.The case is Wright et al v Amazon.com Inc, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 25-00977.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RV0QS:0-amazon-com-is-sued-over-alleged-sale-of-contaminated-rice/"
"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold INOD Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747411920000,"Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company’s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata’s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues — highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company’s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% — demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology — each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management’s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD’s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts’ bearish sentiments about the stock. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Magnitude - Consensus Estimate TrendINOD’s Valuation Looks StretchedInnodata's current valuation seems stretched, as evidenced by its one-year forward price-to-sales ratio of 4.31 — well above the Zacks Computer – Services industry average of 1.76. This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company’s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere’s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata. With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit. While long-term prospects look strong amid rising AI spending from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, near-term risks tied to customer concentration, execution and margin pressure remain.Given the southward revision of earnings estimates and the current valuation suggesting caution for new entrants, existing shareholders should consider holding, and new investors may wait for further validation of revenue diversification and pipeline conversion before adding to positions.INOD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Humain Partners with U.S. Tech Companies to Build AI Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia — Update,1747156260000,"By Adriano Marchese and Connor HartHumain, the arm of Saudi Arabia's public investment fund focused on artificial intelligence, will partner with several U.S. tech companies to build out AI infrastructure in the country.The AI value-chain subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on Monday said it has formed strategic partnerships with Nvidia, Amazon.com and Advanced Micro Devices. Under these three collaborations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expects more than $15 billion of investments to contribute to the deployment of hundreds of megawatts of AI compute capacity over the coming years.Humain earlier in the day disclosed its partnership with chipmaking giant Nvidia, under which it planned to build AI factories in the country with a projected capacity of up to 500 megawatts, powered by hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's GPUs.The first phase of deployment would involve about 18,000 of Nvidia's supercomputers, the parties said.Later, in a separate release, Humain said it would work with Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, to invest more than $5 billion and build what it called an AI Zone. This zone is set to combine multiple AI capabilities and will allow Humain to develop AI solutions using AWS technologies for its end customers, it added.Amazon's recent investment follows a previously announced, separate $5.3 billion investment to build an AWS infrastructure region in Saudi Arabia that is set to become available next year.Humain will additionally partner with Advanced Micro Devices to build a network of AMD-based AI computing centers stretching from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. The parties will invest up to $10 billion to deploy 500 megawatts of AI computing capacity over the next five years.The AI superstructure built by AMD and Humain will be open by design, accessible at scale and optimized to power AI workloads across enterprise, start-up and sovereign markets, they said.Investors rallied behind the investments. In afternoon trading Tuesday, Nvidia's shares rose 5.8%, to $130.18; Amazon's shares climbed 2.4%, to $213.75; and AMD's shares gained 3.8%, to $112.27.Write to Adriano Marchese at adriano.marchese@wsj.com and Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250513008533:0-humain-partners-with-u-s-tech-companies-to-build-ai-infrastructure-in-saudi-arabia-update/

BigBear.ai Stock 65% Below Its 52-Week High: Buy the Dip or Stay Away?,1747405620000,"BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI stock has had a rough ride in 2025, declining 18.2% year to date, underperforming both the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which is down 5.2%, and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector, which has dipped 1.3%. As a result, BBAI now trades nearly 65% below its 52-week high of $10.36 and hovers close to its 52-week low of $1.17.BBAI YTD Share Price PerformanceAs a focused artificial intelligence (AI) company, BigBear.ai offers decision intelligence solutions that aim to help organizations make more informed, data-driven decisions. Despite the long-term promise of AI and continued enterprise investment in the space, BBAI faces near-term headwinds. Market volatility in early 2025 has weighed heavily on speculative tech names, especially those still operating at a loss.In its recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, BigBear.ai posted revenues of $34.8 million, marking a 5% increase from a year ago, but missing analyst expectations by 3.2%. The company recorded an adjusted loss of 10 cents per share, which was wider than the consensus estimate of a 6-cent loss per share. Adjusted EBITDA also deteriorated, falling to a loss of $7 million from a $1.6 million loss last year. This was largely driven by increased R&D spending and ongoing SG&A expenses amid government funding delays. On a GAAP basis, the net loss narrowed significantly to $62 million from $127.8 million a year earlier, though the figure remained impacted by non-cash charges such as derivative losses and stock-based compensation.As investors weigh on the company’s potential in the AI space against its financial losses and operational uncertainties, the key question remains: Is this recent weakness a buying opportunity, or does more downside risk lie ahead for BigBear.ai?What’s Hurting BigBear.ai Stock’s Performance?Profitability Pressured by Delays & Increased Investment : Despite its positioning, BigBear.ai continues to face meaningful headwinds. Revenue remains ""lumpy,"" driven by the timing of government contracts and milestone achievements. The company acknowledged procurement and funding delays due to shifts in federal efficiency mandates—an issue that may persist through the mid-year.Furthermore, increased R&D expenses, which jumped $3 million year over year in the first quarter, and elevated SG&A from underutilized capacity weighed on margins and operating performance. Recurring SG&A rose to $17.7 million from $13.6 million, partly due to the full-quarter impact of the Pangiam acquisition and continued spending to support unutilized resources caused by government funding delays. Adjusted gross margin declined slightly to 28.6%, and EBITDA losses widened, indicating near-term scalability challenges.Another ongoing concern is the high degree of non-cash financial activity, including $2.6 million in debt extinguishment losses and growing stock-based compensation, which affects bottom-line optics.Persistent Challenges in Cost Control and Revenue Recognition Timing : Several structural challenges persist. Elevated operating expenses, especially from hiring and system integration, are weighing heavily on margins. The company cited delays in government funding as a reason for excess staffing costs and underutilized capacity, a scenario that may repeat if fiscal uncertainties continue.Moreover, a $33 million increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities, primarily due to warrant revaluations and note conversions, contributed to increased volatility in reported results. While these are non-cash items, they significantly impact bottom-line perception and investor sentiment.The lack of visibility around contract timing and the company’s exposure to federal budget cycles remain material risks, particularly given BigBear.ai’s heavy reliance on public sector clients.Can the BigBear.ai Stock Stage a Comeback?Strategic Contracts and AI Expansion : A cornerstone of BigBear.ai’s first-quarter traction was the award of a significant contract to deliver and maintain the Department of Defense Joint Staff J35’s Orion Decision Support Platform. This contract is notable not just for its size but also for its strategic relevance, as it affirms BigBear’s capability to meet high-level defense analytics and decision-making needs.Additionally, the company deepened relationships in sectors such as shipbuilding and logistics, with expanded work for clients like Austal USA. These engagements showcase how BigBear is leveraging its analytics suite to improve operational efficiency and supply chain visibility in strategically vital industries. Such wins are a testament to the company’s dual strengths — technical AI sophistication and domain-specific expertise.Internationally, partnerships such as the one with Smith Detection on prohibited item detection are helping the company penetrate global security markets.BigBear.ai is steadily expanding its footprint through strategic alliances with leading technology firms, reinforcing the credibility and utility of its AI-driven solutions. Major players like Amazon AMZN, Palantir PLTR, and Autodesk ADSK have integrated BigBear.ai’s technologies into their ecosystems, showcasing growing enterprise adoption.Amazon Web Services (AWS) has embedded BigBear.ai’s ProModel solution into AWS ProServe, leveraging its predictive modeling and real-time analytics to optimize logistics and warehouse operations. In the defense and intelligence space, Palantir has teamed up with BigBear.ai to strengthen its AI capabilities, underscoring the relevance of BBAI’s solutions in high-stakes environments. Additionally, Autodesk is utilizing BigBear.ai’s technology to enhance its design and engineering platforms, highlighting applications in industrial automation and complex system simulation.This momentum aligns with the company’s dual-pronged 2025 strategy—fortifying its core U.S. defense and government tech markets while branching out into commercial and international verticals. CEO Kevin McAleenan emphasized a mission-driven innovation model that blends advanced AI with operational understanding, giving the company an edge in domains like border security and supply chain intelligence.Innovation-Focused Product Portfolio Gains Traction : The company’s broad and expanding portfolio of AI products also served as a key driver. Platforms like Pangiam Threat Detection, ProModel AI, ConductorOS, and Shipyard.ai are designed to solve complex logistics, analytics, and decision-making challenges across both government and commercial sectors. Some of these products, particularly veriScan and Trueface, contributed directly to revenue gains this quarter.Importantly, several R&D projects have now transitioned into general availability, which could enhance monetization and adoption rates going forward. This shift from pure R&D to deployable solutions underscores BigBear.ai’s ability to commercialize innovation and move up the technology maturity curve.Estimates Show Bearish Trend for BBAI StockThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share is pegged at 41 cents, which has widened from 21 cents in the past 30 days. Yet, the estimated figure indicates a narrower loss from a loss of $1.10 per share a year ago.BBAI Stock’s ValuationIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales (P/S), BBAI is trading at 6.07X, higher than its three-year median of 1.90X but lower than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.17X. BBAI currently has a Value Score of F.How to Play BBAI Stock Now?Despite BigBear.ai's promising strategic alliances and expanding AI product portfolio, the near-term outlook remains challenged by weak financial performance, lack of profitability, and structural risks. The company’s wider-than-expected first-quarter losses, deteriorating EBITDA, and contracting gross margins point to scalability issues amid persistent delays in government funding. Operational inefficiencies, including elevated SG&A and underutilized capacity, have significantly pressured margins, while non-cash derivative losses and stock-based compensation further distort true profitability.With revenue growth falling short and cost controls still elusive, the path to sustainable earnings remains uncertain. The stock’s 65% plunge from its 52-week high, combined with a bearish shift in 2025 earnings estimates, suggests sentiment may worsen before stabilizing. Valuation also appears stretched relative to its historical average, with a high forward P/S and an unfavorable Value Score of F.

How Should You Play Nebius Stock Going Into Q1 Earnings?,1747402560000,"Nebius Group N.V . NBIS will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 20, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 45 cents. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past seven days but has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $63.8 million.Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company. Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS’ Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS’ Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will ‍boast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. These behemoths already have a global-scale AI cloud, whereas NBIS is still expanding its infrastructure. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market.NBIS Stock PerformanceNebius shares have lost 19.5% over the past three months, underscoring broader and company-specific challenges. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector decline of 5.1% and the Zacks Internet Software Services industry’s gain of 4.3%.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its peers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 11.3% and 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame, while Microsoft has gained 10.7%.NBIS' ValuationIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 2.59X, lower than the Internet Software Services industry’s ratio of 4.12, but it could mean more risk than opportunity.Investment Thesis for NBIS StockGiven Nebius' ongoing investments in its core AI infrastructure platform and promising growth in Toloka and Avride platforms, long-term potential remains. However, significant margin pressure owing to ongoing investments and fierce competition from behemoths clouds the outlook. The negative Earnings ESP and muted stock performance further temper expectations. Retaining NBIS stock ahead of earnings appears prudent, but cautious optimism is warranted.What to Do With NBIS Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds in the AI space, it is an exciting growth story, but one with competitive pressures that investors must closely monitor.NBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:fdddaf27b094b:0-how-should-you-play-nebius-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/

C3.ai vs. UiPath: Which AI Automation Stock Is the Better Buy in 2025?,1747154160000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI and UiPath Inc . PATH are both high-profile players in the booming AI automation sector. C3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications, including predictive maintenance and generative AI tools, while UiPath leads in robotic process automation and is evolving toward “agentic AI” solutions. Both companies have seen recent momentum amid the broader artificial intelligence hype. In 2025, each presents a distinct case: C3.ai is smaller but growing faster, whereas UiPath is larger with more stable financials.These companies stand at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing trends—AI and digital transformation—making them compelling candidates for investors eyeing long-term technology disruption. Recent volatility in both stocks, coupled with evolving enterprise spending patterns and new product developments, has reignited interest in evaluating their investment potential. With macroeconomic uncertainty pressuring tech valuations and AI narratives driving short-term sentiment, now is an opportune time to assess which stock holds more promise.Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is the better investment at present.The Case for C3.ai StockC3.ai markets itself as an enterprise AI pure play, offering a suite of prebuilt, configurable AI applications that help large organizations implement predictive analytics, detect anomalies, and optimize operations. In theory, this makes its platform highly scalable across sectors. C3.ai has positioned itself as a pure-play enterprise AI software company, offering a broad portfolio of over 100 pre-built AI applications across various industries, including energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Central to the company’s growth strategy is its deepening alignment with major cloud providers and government institutions, designed to accelerate go-to-market efforts and extend distribution scale.C3.ai’s strengths center on its leadership in enterprise AI. The company claims first-mover status in “model-driven” AI applications, having expanded across numerous industries (19 in total) and the U.S. federal government, where federal revenues grew more than 100% in fiscal 2024. The company has secured large customers and pilots — recent announced deals include ExxonMobil XOM, the U.S. Navy, Shell, BASF, and multiple state/local governments. Strategic partnerships bolster C3.ai’s reach. For example, C3.ai is the most sought-after AI application on Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure cloud marketplace. It has a tie-up with Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud and Amazon ’s AMZN Amazon Web Services. Since announcing an expanded alliance with Microsoft in late 2024, C3.ai closed 28 new deals through joint engagements, spanning nine industries. Sales cycles with Microsoft have shortened by approximately 20%, a testament to the strength of their joint go-to-market motions. As of the fiscal third-quarter end, C3.ai and Microsoft were engaged in more than 600 active enterprise opportunities globally. These factors suggest that there will be continued opportunities as companies seek AI tools to streamline processes and decision-making.In its fiscal third-quarter results, C3.ai reported total revenues of $98.8 million, marking a 26% increase year over year. Subscription revenues grew 22% year over year to $85.7 million, constituting 87% of total revenues. The company closed 66 agreements, including 50 pilots, a 72% increase year over year.C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non GAAP loss of 12 cents per share). The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.Although cash reserves are large ($724.3 million at the fiscal third-quarter end), continued losses raise the risk of dilution or spending pressure. Competition is fierce – from other AI startups to tech giants building in-house AI solutions, which could pressure C3.ai’s growth or pricing. Growth also appears to be moderating after a surge in activity. Revenue growth rate decreased from 29% in the fiscal second quarter to 26% in the fiscal third quarter.The Case for UiPath StockUiPath operates in the adjacent, yet distinct, space of robotic process automation. Its platform automates rule-based, repetitive digital tasks—freeing up human workers and reducing costs for businesses. In contrast to C3.ai’s focus on predictive analytics and machine learning, UiPath emphasizes process optimization, task mining, and digital workflow orchestration. This has enabled it to gain broad adoption across banking, insurance, healthcare, and public sector clients. UiPath’s strengths lie in its market leadership and innovation. UiPath has a large global customer base and high retention (net retention approximately 110–115%), meaning existing accounts keep expanding. Management notes that 90% of surveyed enterprises see opportunities for agentic AI in their workflows, suggesting a large addressable market ahead. Furthermore, UiPath enjoys very high gross margins (85% non-GAAP in the fiscal fourth quarter) and has been streamlining its cost structure, supporting improved profitability.UiPath’s business and financial profile contrast sharply with C3.ai’s. UiPath is much larger and has recently been moving toward profitability. In fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31, 2025), UiPath reported revenues of $1.43 billion, up 9% year over year. In the fiscal fourth quarter (October 2024–January 2025), revenues were $424 million (up 5%). Its subscription and recurring model yields stable bookings — year-end Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $1.666 billion (up 14%). Crucially, UiPath generated a GAAP operating profit of $34 million in the fiscal fourth quarter (versus a year-ago loss) and $241 million of non-GAAP operating income for the full year. Free cash flow was robust, reaching $328 million in fiscal 2025. The company ended the year with about $1.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet and launched a $500 million share buyback program, announced during the fiscal second quarter. These figures point to a healthy, cash-generative model, despite modest growth.On the other hand, UiPath faces challenges. Its revenue growth rate has slowed to mid-single digits (10% in the fiscal second quarter, 9% in the fiscal third quarter, 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter) as large enterprises moderate spending. Global economic uncertainty — especially in the U.S. public sector — has pressured guidance. Competition is fierce: Microsoft (Power Automate), Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and even open-source tools vie for the automation market. UiPath remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis for the year (fiscal 2025 GAAP operating loss was $163 million), though it expects to sustain profitability going forward.Share Price Performance & Valuations for C3.ai, UiPath StocksPATH (up 3%) has performed better than AI (down 29.7%) so far in 2025. Over the past month, PATH has gained 22.2%, more than AI’s 20.6% rally.Share Price PerformanceValuationC3.ai is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7X, below its three-year median of 8.33X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 5.74X. PATH’s forward earnings multiple sits at 4.63X, below its three-year median of 6.41X. The C3.ai stock appears expensive when compared with the sector average and PATH.While both companies operate in the AI automation space, UiPath's valuation metrics suggest a more balanced investment profile, with expectations of future profitability and valuations in line with industry norms. C3.ai carries a higher valuation premium and lacks current profitability, which may present greater investment risk.Comparing EPS Projections: C3.ai & UiPathThe 2025 EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days for PATH stock while the same remained unchanged for C3.ai. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C3.ai’s 2025 bottom line suggests a 4.3% improvement, while that for PATH indicates a year-over-year decline of 1.9%.For C3.ai StockFor UiPath StockConclusionBoth C3.ai and UiPath are positioned to benefit from the continued interest in AI-driven automation, but their risk/reward profiles differ. C3.ai offers higher growth potential, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicating 29.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, and first-mover advantages in the enterprise AI market. However, it is still unprofitable, burning cash. In contrast, UiPath is larger and almost cash-flow positive. It generates profits on a non-GAAP basis, boasts a strong balance sheet, and recently returned capital via a $500 million buyback.In a nutshell, C3.ai’s upside depends on sustaining rapid growth and successfully scaling new AI offerings, which is far from certain, given competition and macro risks. UiPath, while growing more slowly, has a more proven business model and valuation that is easier to justify. UiPath — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company - appears to offer better upside potential in 2025. Its combination of profitability, strong cash flow, and reasonable valuation makes it more resilient if growth disappoints. C3.ai — a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company — could outperform on strong AI tailwinds, but it is riskier and richly priced.

"Is META Stock's 24.18X PE Still Worth it? Buy, Sell, or Hold?",1747153140000,"Meta Platforms META shares are trading at a premium as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E), META is trading at 24.18X, a premium compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 23.72X. Meta Platforms shares are trading at a premium compared to its closest peer in the digital advertising domain, Alphabet GOOGL, but at a discount compared with Amazon AMZN. In terms of the forward 12-month P/E, Alphabet shares are trading at 16.26X, while Amazon is trading at 31.44X. Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to absorb roughly 50% of the projected global ad spending by 2028.P/E Ratio (F12M)Although higher tariffs and a prolonged trade war have the potential to hurt digital advertising spending, negatively impacting prospects, we believe Meta Platforms’ AI focus is a key catalyst. Meta Platforms’ focus on leveraging AI to improve user engagement is noteworthy. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement. Amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Meta Platforms shares have appreciated 9.2% year to date, outperforming the broader sector as well as peers, including Alphabet and Amazon, shares of which have dropped 4.9% and 16.3%, respectively.META Stock’s PerformanceMETA shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.META Shares Trade Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs  META Leverages AI to Boost Advertising RevenuesMeta Platforms focuses on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA NVDA. The deployment of META’s deep neural network on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip across Instagram and Facebook applications has achieved more than 6% recall improvement to the retrieval system while delivering over 8% ad quality improvement on selected segments. Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that was used on Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months. META’s growing focus on social commerce through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is noteworthy. In first-quarter 2025, WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions contributed to deliver 34% year-over-year growth in Family of Apps other revenues, reaching $510 million.META’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward MovementThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.84 per share, up by 3.2% over the past 30 days, indicating a 13.18% year-over-year increase.META’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.30%. Meta Platforms, Inc.

Quote Here’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right NowAI usage is making META a popular name among advertisers as well as users.However, operating expenses are expected in the $114-$119 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Generative AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs, make the stock a risky bet.META is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by its Gen AI initiatives and core business. Although these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe the lack of monetization of new platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. The company doesn’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. Meta Platforms plans to focus on scaling and deepening engagements for Meta AI over the next few years.META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

"Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square bets on Amazon, exits Canadian Pacific",1747949371000,"Billionaire investor Bill Ackman told clients on Thursday that his hedge fund bought Amazon shares last month, betting earnings will continue to grow at the online retailer as President Donald Trump's tariffs bite less than consumers initially feared.Ackman and his investment team updated clients on additions to the portfolio at his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. ""The most substantial move is Amazon,"" chief investment officer, Ryan Israel, said on a conference call.With a value of over $2 trillion, Amazon is one of the world's most valuable companies and has long featured on Ackman's list of most admired businesses.As one of the world's most voluble activist investors who often pushes companies to perform better, Ackman's stock picks are closely watched for investment trends.But Amazon stock had been too costly until early April when the market was battered by news of Trump's heavy tariffs for imported goods and its price cratered.""We felt that the company would be able to work through any slowdown in the cloud computing division Amazon Web Services and we did not judge that tariffs would have a material impact on the earnings in the retail business,"" Israel said.Ackman and his team also expressed confidence in Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy, saying his ability to run the business more efficiently will allow for ""more profit margin expansion at a high rate of revenue growth.""Pershing Square had also added stakes in car rental company Hertz NASDAQ:HTZ and transport company Uber NYSE:UBER into the portfolio.At the same time, the firm sold out of railroad Canadian Pacific TSX:CP , Ackman said, noting that it is a position the firm sold ""with regret"". Ackman in 2022 built a new stake in Canadian Pacific, returning to one of his most profitable investments as rail firms eye a boost from the drive to cut carbon emissions and as manufacturing is brought back to the United States and Mexico from abroad.But in order to buy the Amazon stake, Ackman needed to make adjustments and came to liquidate Canadian Pacific. He stressed that he thinks ""extremely highly of the Canadian Pacific team"" and has ""a very strong belief in the long-term future of the business.""The team also trimmed investments in Chipotle Mexican Grill NYSE:CMG , Hilton Worldwide Holdings NYSE:HLT , Universal Music Group EURONEXT:UMG and swapped the firm's Nike NYSE:NKE stock into call options, calling it a ""deep-in-the-money strategy.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU0ZO:0-ackman-s-hedge-fund-pershing-square-bets-on-amazon-exits-canadian-pacific/"

"Weeks after Amazon's Alexa+ AI launch, a mystery: where are the users?",1747389600000,"Alexa, where are your users?More than six weeks after Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN began rolling out the new Alexa+ generative artificial-intelligence-powered voice assistant to hundreds of thousands of people, there is scant evidence it is in regular customers' hands.The new service was meant to be a triumph for Amazon after several delays in revamping Alexa in the age of AI chatbots like ChatGPT. The company signaled its significance by bringing CEO Andy Jassy to a February press event in New York where it showcased Alexa+’s capabilities and promised customers would start getting invite access in late March.“There seems to be no one who actually has it,” said Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponential, who attended the Alexa+ announcement event. “This fits a pattern of a lot of companies announcing services or products when they are awfully close to being ready, but not quite – that last mile is a lot farther away than they anticipated,” he said. In an ultimately unsuccessful effort to locate real-world users of Alexa+, Reuters searched dozens of news sites, YouTube, TikTok, X, BlueSky and Meta's Instagram and Facebook, as well as Amazon's Twitch and reviews of Echo voice-assistant devices on Amazon.com. Two who posted on Reddit claimed to have used the service, but did not provide Reuters with hard evidence and their identities could not be corroborated. ""Hundreds of thousands of customers now have access to Alexa+ — of course, some are employees and their families, but the overwhelming majority are customers that requested early access,” said an Amazon spokesperson. That is up from the approximately 100,000 users that Amazon reported on May 1.Amazon did not say why there were no verifiable public reviews or reactions to the new service and declined to make available for an interview any active Alexa+ users. The company does not require nondisclosure agreements in exchange for Alexa+ access, a spokesperson said.The rollout of Amazon AI-assisted Alexa+ is proceeding slowly and the service has struggled with speed in answering some questions or prompts, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. It also occasionally generates inaccurate or fabricated information, like other AI models, and is expensive to operate, the people said.Accessed mainly through Amazon televisions and Echo devices, Alexa can set timers, answer search queries and tell the weather if a user requests it out loud. While Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL Siri voice assistant preceded the original Alexa by three years, it was the Amazon service that supercharged the acceptance of voice assistants. The overhaul resulting in the generative AI-infused Alexa+ is meant to revitalize the decade-old service and help Amazon compete with chatbots from OpenAI, Meta NASDAQ:META and others. Amazon has plowed billions into developing Alexa since it was introduced in 2014, but it has been unprofitable and the vision of customers using it for voice-shopping never materialized.Technology companies typically rely on a mix of analysts, product reviewers, social media influencers and reporters to help get the word out about their newest devices or services. Apple, considered a master of marketing, gives launch-event attendees limited access to its iPhones or laptops for initial reviews, followed shortly by lengthier scrutiny within days or weeks of announcement. Amazon itself gave reviewers time to test out its new color Kindle device at an event in October before making it available to buy just two weeks later.In September 2023, Amazon showed off a prior iteration of the generative AI-infused Alexa and said customers would be getting an ""early preview"" of it within weeks. It never came. Alexa+ will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and even act as an “agent” on behalf of users by taking actions for them without their direct involvement. That contrasts with the current iteration, which generally handles only a single request at a time.During Amazon’s first-quarter earnings call two weeks ago, Jassy said more than 100,000 people were already using the new voice service and that “people are really liking Alexa+ thus far.”Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said that by leaving a large gap between product launch and general availability, Amazon was failing to build anticipation for Alexa+. ""Just lean on your curated YouTube or TikTok advocates and tell them what to talk about,” he said. “Instead, this makes it look like they are worried about something.”Techsponential's Greengart said the February Alexa event could be seen as an early warning sign because attendees were not allowed to try the service themselves, instead being shuffled into breakout sessions where product managers ran through well-rehearsed routines and answered limited questions. Reuters, which attended the event, was also unable to try out the service.By contrast, at Amazon’s 2014 launch for its Fire Phone, users could hold the device and try its features. The original Echo device, running the Alexa service, became available weeks after its announcement in November 2014 and users went public with their reactions that December.The upgraded Alexa is designed to allow users to seek shopping advice such as vacation outfits and to receive aggregated news stories. As shown, it is meant to carry out more complicated requests, such as ordering food for delivery while also remembering a user’s dietary preferences.To demonstrate Alexa+'s broad use, Amazon pointed to an April TechRadar story that cited an anonymous Reddit post from a user claiming to have tested the service. The Reddit post has since been deleted.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0TK:0-weeks-after-amazon-s-alexa-ai-launch-a-mystery-where-are-the-users/"

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Away, an Original Internet Darling, Will Sell Its Luggage in More Places — WSJ",1747348200000,"By Katie DeightonAway, the luggage and travel brand that found its fame selling fashionable luggage directly to consumers online, has named new leadership and begun selling beyond its own website and branded stores as it tries to reach more consumers.Jen Rubio, a co-founder of Away and its chief executive officer since 2021, stepped down this week and assumed the role of executive chair. She was succeeded by Jessica Schinazi, a former executive at appliance-maker Dyson, fashion house LVMH and Amazon.com who had been president of Away since December.In a press release, Rubio described Schinazi as the right leader for Away because of her focus on operations. ""This transition is a natural next step for Away,"" said Rubio, who has built a luxury real-estate portfolio with her husband, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield.This week, Away began selling some of its suitcases and bags on Amazon's U.S. website. It also announced that another selection will be available for purchase at Nordstrom locales and via the department store's website later this month. The brand made its first foray into wholesale with Dick's Sporting Goods last year.The moves are a departure for Away, which until recently had exclusively sold its luggage via its own channels. Founded in 2015, the company was part of a pack of direct-to-consumer startups that sidestepped traditional retailers and drew online shoppers with digital advertising, easy-to-navigate websites and stylish branding. Rubio and her co-founder, Steph Korey Goodwin, had both worked previously at direct-to-consumer eyewear brand Warby Parker.Like many later players from the direct-to-consumer boom, Away decided it would benefit from at least a limited presence in physical retail. Since 2016, it has opened 17 stand-alone stores primarily on the East and West coasts and in Texas, and plans to open more, targeting customers who want to see a $275 carry-on in real life before buying.Despite those physical stores, some shoppers outside those locations were ""saying, 'Hey, you're not in my city, and I really want to go and touch the products,'"" Schinazi said. Others wanted to shop at a department store to compare brands and collect loyalty points, she added. Deals with companies like Nordstrom, which carries competitor brands like Béis, Monos and Samsonite, ""feel like a really good way to meet the customers where they are in those locations right now,"" she said.As for Amazon, Away knew that potential customers were already searching for its name on the marketplace and winding up buying from companies that attached their products to the brand via search engine optimization practices.The company's Amazon storefront lists nine products, including its flagship suitcases. Nordstrom will carry a different selection, including Away's pricier aluminum suitcases and its softside luggage.Away also plans to use new sponsorship deals to help spread its brand further offline. On Thursday, the company announced its new title as the Official Luggage Partner of the WNBA's New York Liberty. That follows a December partnership with the F1 Academy, Formula One Group's female-only racing championship, which saw Scottish driver Logan Hannah take to a track in Abu Dhabi in an Away-branded livery and race suit.In 2019, Away said its sales had totaled $150 million in 2018, and the company was valued at $1.4 billion following a $100 million funding round. The pandemic, however, decimated sales, sending them into a tailspin of more than 90% and forcing the company to furlough or lay off the majority of its staff.Sales and staffing levels have since rebounded, though Away has still had to make head-count cuts, including a 25% reduction last year. Since 2020, it has employed a procession of chief marketing officers, including Selena Kalvaria, Melissa Weiss and Carla Dunham, who left in early 2024 after just over a year in the job.Marketing, including a February collaboration with the HBO resort drama ""White Lotus,"" is now overseen by Christine Gallagher, vice president of integrated marketing.The company declined to disclose recent sales figures.Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515014326:0/
Consumer Stocks Have Taken It on the Chin. Buy These 8. — Barrons.com,1747936800000,"By Jacob SonenshineConsumer stocks are down, but not out. A handful look like buys now.The latest blow came on Wednesday when bond yields popped — and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund and the SPDR S&P Retail Exchange-Traded Fund fell 2% and 3.1%, respectively. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%. Higher yields make borrowing money more expensive, which reduces consumer spending.Both funds had been on a rough stretch before Wednesday because of Wall Street's unease about the consumer companies' earnings. The higher bond yields are making investor sentiment worse, after what's been a steep drop in consumer confidence because of tariffs, which make good and services more expensive. For the year, the broader consumer discretionary ETF is off 4.5% and the retail ETF is down 5.4%. The S&P 500 has dropped only 0.5%.The silver lining is that there are select stocks that not only trade at cheaper prices now, but are also positioned for high earnings growth. Buying them right now makes sense.Citi strategist Scott Chronert looked for the ones to scoop up. He screened for consumer companies with sales that are relatively less sensitive to changes in broader economic activity, and have invested heavily in their businesses to spark high growth.Chronert started with 280 consumer stocks. He had two criteria for companies: sales less correlated to gross domestic product activity in recent years and capital expenditures that represent a relatively large ratio to annual depreciation expense. The second criteria is important because, as long-term assets depreciate, companies that are replacing those assets — and adding more — are signaling that they're prepared for ever-higher demand because they're aggressively growing.Names on the screen are Amazon.com, Costco, Tractor Supply, Procter & Gamble, Kroger, and Domino's Pizza.Another is Walmart. It's a rare retailer whose total sales aren't so sensitive to changes in consumer demand because the majority of its sales come from groceries.The discount chain has plenty of growth potential: Its total capital expenditures in the past five years, including analysts' estimates for this year, are $95 billion, about 1.6 times total depreciation expense in that period. So for every dollar of asset value lost, Walmart invests more than a dollar to increase its asset base. It's beefing up its capabilities for buy-online-pickup-in-store, e-commerce, and advertising.The idea is to add revenue streams and gradually take business from other retail outlets. That's why, after sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter, analysts expect just over 4% sales growth annually over the next three years to $768 billion, according to FactSet. That's nothing to scoff at for an already-large retailer that's outperforming other retailers. Target, for example, saw sales decline in the first quarter.Walmart's sales growth can nudge profit margins higher, which analysts forecast. If it needs to raise prices it can, though most of the growth in the first quarter came from more purchases rather than higher prices. As the advertising business ramps up, it can contribute to higher margins since the ad business generally has lower costs versus retail.Plus, Walmart is buying back stock every quarter, helping push analysts' EPS growth projections close to 10% annually.That can bring the stock higher, assuming shares aren't priced too expensively. They trade at what appears on the surface to be an expensive just over 35 times expected earnings for the coming 12 months. But at just over twice the retail fund's 14.8 times, it's about in line with the type of premium it has tended to fetch over the past couple of years, given its consistent earnings and growth trajectory.Walmart is a textbook example of a winning consumer stock right now. So are the other seven.Just remember: Consumer stocks aren't all the same. Take a look at a company's potential before you walk away.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at 33 cents, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. The Trade Desk Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Trade Desk price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Trade Desk QuoteThe company also noted that its Kokai platform was now being used by two-thirds of the clients, much ahead of schedule. The platform is now delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion and 20% lower cost per acquisition, added TTD. 100% adoption by clients is expected to be completed by the year-end. The integration of Koa AI tools was highlighted by management as a “game changer” for the Kokai platform.TTD also completed the acquisition of Sincera, a leading digital advertising data company. This buyout will help enhance its programmatic advertising platform by integrating Sincera’s actionable insights on data quality. Unified ID 2.0, the company’s flagship identity solution and an alternative to third-party cookies, is witnessing increasing adoption. For the second quarter of 2025, revenues are expected to be $682 million.Where is TTD Headed From Here?Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions do not augur well for TTD, as these could squeeze ad budgets. TTD highlighted the impact of the volatile macro backdrop, particularly on the large global brands. If macro headwinds worsen or persist into the second half of 2025, revenue growth may face further pressure due to reduced programmatic demand.The intensely competitive nature of the digital advertising industry, dominated by industry giants like Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN, as well as players like Magnite MGNI, continues to put pressure on TTD’s market positioning. Growing regulatory scrutiny around data privacy and evolving consumer data practices also threaten to disrupt the established audience-targeting methods.While CTV remains a strong revenue driver, the market is increasingly fragmented and competitive. Heavy reliance on CTV for growth is a concern, as any adverse impact on this segment could weigh heavily on the overall performance. Moreover, TTD derived 88% of its revenue from North America while only 12% came from international markets. A weak international footprint limits TTD’s total addressable market expansion potential.Increasing costs are likely to weigh on profitability. In the last reported quarter, total operating costs surged 21.4% year over year to $561.6 million. Expenses soared on account of continued investments in boosting platform capabilities, particularly platform operations. Higher costs can prove a drag on margins, especially if the revenue growth does not keep pace. Given all these factors, analysts remain bearish on the stock, as evident from the downward estimate revision in the past 30 days. TTD Stock Plunge Steeper than PeersTTD stock’s plunge of 32.5% YTD is steeper than the 13.7% decline of the Internet Services industry and the 1.3% decline of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its digital advertising peers, including Alphabet and Amazon and Magnite. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 16.3% and 4.9%, respectively, in the same time frame. Magnite has gained 1.3% YTD. Magnite is a supply-side platform that helps publishers manage and sell their ad inventory across various formats like streaming, online video, display and audio.Lofty Valuation for TTDFrom a valuation perspective, TTD is quite expensive. The stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 12.99X compared with the industry’s 4.75X.Investment Thesis for TTD StockDespite strong first-quarter results, The Trade Desk faces significant headwinds from macroeconomic uncertainty, rising costs, and fierce competition. Its heavy reliance on CTV and North America limits growth flexibility. Steep stock decline YTD, downward estimate revision activity and expensive valuation are other concerns.

"With UPS Out, Amazon Turns to FedEx — Barrons.com",1747144800000,"Al RootFedEx stock fell Tuesday after Amazon.com said it would be working with the logistics provider on last-mile delivery.FedEx shares were up in premarket trading, but gains faded, leaving them down 0.3% at $232.16.Despite the drop, BofA Securities analyst Ken Hoexter said the Amazon business will be ""accretive to yields and profitability."" He rates FedEx stock Buy and has a $270 price target on the shares.FedEx shares gained 6.9% in regular trading on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 3.3% and 2.8%, respectively. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China sent most shares higher, including shares of logistics providers. Shares of United Parcel Service added 5.6%, closing at $101.21. UPS was down 1.2% on Tuesday.Coming into the week, FedEx and UPS shares had fallen 21% and 28%, respectively, since the Nov. 5 election. President Donald Trump is an advocate for tariffs, and high tariffs aren't typically positive for shipping volumes.One reason UPS stock has underperformed FedEx is a fear that less Amazon.com business could pressure profit margins and earnings growth. In its fourth-quarter earnings update in January, UPS said it was shedding some business from the e-commerce company. Shares dropped 14% in response. Amazon amounted to more than 10% of UPS sales in 2024, but it is a less profitable business than average. The Amazon ""volume is not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network,"" said CEO Carol Tomé on her company's second-quarter earnings conference call in April.Working with Amazon can be difficult. FedEx walked away from its Amazon business in 2019. Now it's back.""We've reached an agreement with FedEx to serve as one of several third-party partners to deliver packages to our customers,"" Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement.""FedEx has the global network, capacity, and expertise to serve the shipping needs of thousands of retailers in the e-commerce space,"" said FedEx in an emailed statement. ""We have reached a mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement to provide residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.""The new FedEx relationship isn't a replacement for UPS. Amazon utilizes several third-party logistics, including UPS, the U.S. Post Office, and, again, FedEx. However, Amazon delivers two-thirds of its own packages. In 2023, Amazon delivered some 5.9 billion packages in the U.S., according to Capital One Shopping Research.That's a lot of packages. The USPS delivered about 7 billion packages in 2023. FedEx Ground delivered closer to 3 billion packages in its fiscal year ended May 2024.It isn't unusual for retail and consumer goods organizations to internalize logistics as they grow. Walmart owns more than 12,000 semi-trucks, according to Transport Topics. PepsiCo owns almost 12,000.Earnings continued to grow after FedEx and Amazon split in 2019. FedEx earned about $12 a share in 2019. It's expected to earn north of $19 in 2025.Earnings growth has been tougher for UPS. It earned about $7.50 a share in 2019. It's expected to earn about $7 in 2025.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Startup Anthropic says its new AI model can code for hours at a time,1747936024000,"Artificial intelligence lab Anthropic unveiled its latest top-of-the-line technology called Claude Opus 4 on Thursday, which it says can write computer code autonomously for much longer than its prior systems.The startup, backed by Google-parent Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , has distinguished its work in part by building AI that excels at coding. It also announced another AI model Claude Sonnet 4, Opus's smaller and more cost-effective cousin.Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger called the release a milestone in Anthropic's work to make increasingly autonomous AI. He said in an interview with Reuters that customer Rakuten had Opus 4 coding for nearly seven hours, while an Anthropic researcher set up the AI model to play 24 hours of a Pokemon game. That's up from about 45 minutes of game play for its prior model Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic told MIT Technology Review.""For AI to really have the economic and productivity impact that I think it can have, the models do need to be able to work autonomously and work coherently for that (longer) amount of time,"" he said.The news follows a flurry of other AI announcements this week, including from Google, with which Anthropic also competes. Anthropic also said its new AI models can give near-instant answers or take longer to reason through questions, as well as do web search.

"Should You Buy, Hold or Sell OKTA Stock Before Q1 Earnings Release?",1747930320000,"Okta OKTA is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 27.For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, Okta anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of 76-77 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/
US-China Talks Spark Optimism; Betting Markets See Recession Odds Drop,1747141200000,"US-China Trade Meeting Sparks Wall Street OptimismMonday, stocks soared on news that the red-hot, escalating trade war between the US and China had thawed as parties from each side announced that negotiators had made significant progress. Meanwhile, the world’s two largest economies issueda rare, joint statement. Both Chinese and US stocks like Tesla ( TSLA ), Alibaba ( BABA ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) applauded the news and gapped higher to start the week. Below are four reasons the long-term trend has changed and bulls are in control:Betting Markets Suggest that 2025 Recession Odds PlungeBetting markets like Polymarket exploded during the 2024 presidential election, with users betting on everything from politics to markets. While several legacy polls were inaccurate in their predictions, betting websites like Polymarket were accurate and correctly predicted that Donald Trump would win a second White House term.One of the more interesting markets that Polymarket offers is the US recession in 2025 market. During the April market mayhem, Polymarket put the odds of a recession at 66%. However, in just under two weeks, the Polymarket recession odds have plunged from a 66% to a 39% chance of a recession in 2025.Image Source: PolyMarketS&P 500, Nasdaq Retake 200-day Moving AverageMonday’s price action was rare. The day’s action marked the first instance since November 9th 2020 where the S&P 500 Index ETF ( SPY ) opened 3% or higher on a Monday morning. Back then, the Pfizer ( PFE ) COVID vaccine was announced calming market fears about a further spread of the pandemic. This time, thawing relations are responsible. In addition to the powerful price action, SPY crossed back over its 200-day moving average – the best metric to measure the long-term trend.Image Source: TradingViewWhat Does the VIX Reversion-to-the-Mean Tell Us?The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, measures Wall Street’s volatility expectations in the S&P 500 Index over the next month. VIX spikes above $45 historically parallel moments of extreme fear and capitulation in US equity markets. For instance, the VIX spiked above $45 in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and in 2020 during the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic pandemonium. Since 1988, the VIX has cycled from above $45 to under $20 six times. In each instance, the S&P 500 Index gained 9 months and a year later.Image Source: @subutradeIn the aftermath of the recent tariff meltdown, the VIX has triggered this signficant VIX cycle again. Will history repeat itself in 2025?The Trade-Deal Domino EffectNow that the US has a preliminary deal with the UK and China, I expect the trade deal scoreboard to morph into a domino effect. With each new deal, President Trump and his team will gain more leverage, making subsequent deals happen quicker and more often. In addition, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will gain more insight into the inflationary situation and will be more likely to cut interest rates and buoy equity markets.Bottom LineA surprising thaw in US-China trade relations sparked significant optimism on Wall Street Monday. This positive development, coupled with lower recession odds, sets up a bullish outlook for investors.

3 Reasons Why Disney Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q2 Earnings Beat,1747139040000,"Disney DIS delivered impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues, demonstrating strong momentum across its business segments. (Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)With shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.Impressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic ExecutionDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.These results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.The Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.Direct-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share. These projections suggest steady growth ahead.(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Streaming Profitability Achieved as Content Drives GrowthAfter years of heavy investment in its streaming platforms, Disney has successfully navigated the challenging transition from traditional media to direct-to-consumer models. The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.Disney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.The company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash . These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.Disney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.Shares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+. While Netflix has returned 24.5% year to date, shares of Amazon and Apple have lost 4.9% and 15.85%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceMultiple Growth Catalysts on the HorizonLooking ahead, Disney has several compelling growth catalysts that should drive shareholder value in the coming years.In sports, ESPN delivered its most-watched second quarter in primetime ever, with viewership among the key 18-49 demographic up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by marquee events like the USA/Canada 4 Nations Championship and Women's College Basketball, which saw its most-watched regular season in 16 years.The company is preparing to launch ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, which should further strengthen its position as the preeminent digital sports platform.Meanwhile, the Experiences segment delivered strong results, with Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income growing 13% compared to the prior-year quarter. At Disney Cruise Line, the Disney Treasure is now in its second full quarter of operations, with two more cruise ships joining the fleet later this year.Most impressive is Disney's unprecedented pipeline of expansion projects around the world, creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California. This includes special celebrations for Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary and Disneyland's historic 70th anniversary.The Bottom Line: Disney Offers Compelling Value at a DiscountBased on its strong second-quarter results and improved outlook, Disney stock appears significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company currently trades at just 19.25 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings, notably below the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry average of 21.37 times. This valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a premium media brand.DIS’ 3-Year P/E TTM Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationManagement has confidently raised guidance for fiscal 2025, now expecting adjusted EPS of approximately $5.75, representing a 16% increase over fiscal 2024. The company also projects approximately $17 billion in cash provided by operations, suggesting a $2 billion increase over prior guidance. This robust cash flow enables continued investments in growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through the company's share repurchase program.ConclusionWith its streaming services now profitable, box office hits driving multi-channel revenues, significant expansion projects underway in the Parks segment, and a valuation below industry averages, Disney offers investors exposure to multiple growth vectors with increasingly solid financial fundamentals. For investors looking for a blue-chip media and entertainment company with both defensive characteristics and growth potential, DIS stock appears to be a compelling buy at current levels. Disney currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

US FTC chair seeks to trim agency by around 10%,1747327488000,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is looking to trim its headcount by around 10%, its chairman told Congress on Thursday, insisting the agency will be able to continue antitrust and consumer protection work with what would be its smallest staff in 10 years.The FTC is in the midst of an ""unprecedented time,"" pursuing antimonopoly cases against companies including Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN and Deere & Co NYSE:DE , while going after the largest pharmacy benefit managers over insulin pricing, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson told a U.S. House of Representatives panel. But he said shrinking the agency further would not hamper that work.""In terms of accomplishing our mission, we can accomplish the mission with 1,100 employees. I have no doubt about it. Because our people are really, really good, and we have shifted our priority, especially away from rulemaking,"" Ferguson said.So far this year, 94 employees have departed the agency, leaving 1,221 full-time employees, Ferguson said. While it laid off a handful of probationary employees, the agency is offering buyouts and has not yet enacted reductions in force.Ferguson did not disclose the details of the FTC's budget request, but said around 1,100 was a healthy staffing level given the agency's current funding. Ferguson's predecessor, Lina Khan, had hired more staff than the agency could afford, he said.The agency has also brought down its contract spending by more than $6 million this year, Ferguson said. Two workers from the Department of Government Efficiency have helped identify contracts to be cut or scaled back, he added.The agency is eyeing ways to reduce its spending on outside data storage providers, and curb the bills from expert trial witnesses that can run as high as $30 million for one case.Ferguson responded to concerns that DOGE, the Elon Musk-led initiative to downsize the government, could gain access to confidential business information, including on Musk's competitors, that the FTC uses to review mergers.He said DOGE workers are subject to the same restrictions as all other FTC employees and cannot access information without appropriate justification.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RN0VL:0-us-ftc-chair-seeks-to-trim-agency-by-around-10/"

Should You Add Alibaba Stock to Your Portfolio Ahead of Q4 Earnings?,1747138740000,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 15.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $33.08 billion, suggesting a 7.64% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.48 per share, indicating an increase of 5.71% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Alibaba has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.87%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average surprise being 1.47%.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and EPS SurpriseAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-eps-surprise | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteEarnings Whispers for BABAOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alibaba this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.BABA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to Note for BABA Ahead of Q4 ResultsAlibaba is expected to deliver robust results in its upcoming fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, building on the strong momentum from its impressive third-quarter performance. Investors should consider positioning themselves ahead of what appears to be another strong quarter, driven by accelerating AI initiatives and cloud computing growth.The company's strategic focus on ""user first, AI-driven"" strategies has already demonstrated substantial progress, with customer management revenues at Taobao and Tmall growing 9% in the third quarter, while Cloud revenue growth reignited to double digits at 13%, with AI-related product revenues achieving triple-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter.The fourth quarter witnessed Alibaba making several significant moves that are likely to have positively impacted upcoming results. The company unveiled an unprecedented RMB 380 billion ($53 billion) investment over the next three years in cloud computing and AI infrastructure — an amount exceeding Alibaba's total AI and cloud spending over the past decade. This bold commitment signals the company's determination to maintain its leadership in the global AI race.Alibaba Cloud continued its global expansion with new cloud regions in Mexico and Thailand, enhancing its international presence to 87 availability zones across 29 regions. These strategic expansions position the company to capture growing cloud computing demand in emerging markets while diversifying its revenue streams beyond China.The company's PolarDB achieved a groundbreaking world record in the TPC-C benchmark, processing 2.055 billion transactions per minute while reducing cost per transaction by almost 40%. This technological advancement showcases Alibaba's capability to deliver superior performance at lower costs, potentially attracting more enterprise clients to its cloud platform.Alibaba's AI innovation maintained impressive momentum with its QWQ-32B model topping popularity charts on Hugging Face with more than 80,000 downloads in just one week. Meanwhile, strategic partnerships with BMW, Honor, and Zeekr are expanding Alibaba's AI reach into automobiles and smartphones, creating new revenue opportunities beyond traditional cloud services.The company's international e-commerce business continued showing strength, with management expecting AIDC to achieve its first quarter of profitability in the next fiscal year. This progress toward profitability in international markets should boost investor confidence in Alibaba's global growth strategy.With BABA trading at compelling valuations relative to its growth prospects and AI leadership, the upcoming earnings report presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to China's technology sector and the booming global AI market.(See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)BABA Price Performance & Stock ValuationAlibaba shares have surged 56.3% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500 index’s decline of 3%, 1.4% and 4.4%, respectively.BABA faces tough competition from Amazon AMZN, JD.com JD and PDD Holdings PDD among others. While JD and PDD have gained 4% and 20%, respectively, in the year-to-date period, AMZN has lost 4.9%.Year-to-date Price PerformanceIt is also important to consider whether the stock's current valuation accurately reflects the company's long-term growth potential and ability to navigate the competitive landscape. Currently, BABA is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 11.91X compared with the industry’s 21.24X, making it an attractive buy opportunity for investors ahead of fiscal fourth-quarter results.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationInvestment ThesisAlibaba presents a compelling buy opportunity ahead of fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, with shares trading at a significant discount despite robust growth catalysts. The company's RMB 380 billion investment in AI and cloud infrastructure positions it at the forefront of technology innovation, while strategic partnerships with BMW, Honor, and Zeekr extend its AI ecosystem beyond traditional boundaries. Cloud revenue continues accelerating with AI-related products maintaining triple-digit growth for six consecutive quarters. Alibaba's international e-commerce segment approaches profitability, diversifying revenue streams. The launch of cutting-edge models like QWQ-32B and the record-breaking performance of PolarDB demonstrate technological leadership. Despite intense competition, Alibaba's discounted valuation fails to reflect its dominant market position and exceptional growth trajectory in the booming AI and cloud sectors.ConclusionAlibaba presents a rare opportunity at current valuations, with its aggressive AI investments and expanding global cloud footprint positioned to drive substantial growth. The company's triple-digit AI revenue growth, strategic partnerships, and breakthrough technological achievements create multiple catalysts ahead of furth-quarter results. As international e-commerce approaches profitability and cloud infrastructure scales, investors should act now before the market fully recognizes Alibaba's transformative potential in the AI era.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:de9037dd7094b:0-should-you-add-alibaba-stock-to-your-portfolio-ahead-of-q4-earnings/

US companies announce layoffs to cut costs,1747911628000,"U.S. companies across sectors have initiated layoffs as they attempt to streamline operations amid economic uncertainties, following similar cutbacks seen last year.Job openings — a measure of labor demand — decreased 288,000 to 7.192 million by the last day of March, according to the labor department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report.

How Should You Play CoreWeave Stock Going Into Q1 Earnings?,1747138260000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 14, after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 21 cents. The estimate has been unchanged in the past seven days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $850.4 million.This is CoreWeave’s first earnings release since it started trading as a listed company on March 28, 2025. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news).What Our Model Predicts for CRWV’s Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CRWV this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CRWV has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to Focus on Ahead of CRWV’s Q1 EarningsCoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company. CRWV’s cloud has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CoreWeave also boasts a growing data center network across the United States and Europe. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. CoreWeave's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.The rapid AI proliferation is transforming the entire tech scene, and AI infrastructure has become a high-stakes battleground for tech companies. Businesses have been increasing spending on AI inference/fine-tuning, AI workload monitoring, and training infrastructure, including training compute, AI servers, AI storage, cloud workloads and networking. This increasing demand for AI cloud platforms, including integrated software and the infrastructure, is likely to have cushioned CRWV’s topline performance. CoreWeave’s cloud Platform is hosted on a distributed network of active data centers. These data centers are connected to key metropolitan areas using low-latency connections and boast cutting-edge data center networking equipment and the latest liquid cooling technologies. As of Dec 31, 2024, CRWV’s 32 data centers were running more than 250,000 GPUs and were supported by more than 360 MW of active power.In May 2025, CRWV completed the acquisition of Weights & Biases to further bolster its cloud platform and expand business operations. Before that, it entered into an agreement with several financial institutions, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, for the expansion of its credit facility from $650 million to $1.5 billion and pushing out the maturity date. CRWV plans to utilize the proceeds to strengthen its AI cloud infrastructure platform.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material.CRWV Stock PerformanceCRWV shares have gained 34% in the past month. It has significantly outperformed the 12.8% gain of Zacks Internet Software industry and the 4.3% of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 6.5% over the same time frame. Price PerformanceThe company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 15.8% and 14.6%, respectively, in the same time frame.Investment Thesis for CRWV StockThe AI infrastructure market continues to expand rapidly in 2025, driven by demand for GPU-intensive applications, including large language models and inference-at-scale workloads. This bodes well for CRWV.Despite a robust market, CoreWeave faces tremendous competition from Azure, AWS and Google Cloud. Also, customer concentration and huge capex owing to data center expansion remain headwinds.What Should You Do With CRWV Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds, it seems a compelling opportunity, but one with competitive pressures and capital risks that investors need to closely monitor.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5c43dc210094b:0-how-should-you-play-coreweave-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/

Spotify Stock Skyrockets 112% in a Year: What's Next for Investors?,1747319040000,"Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT shares have skyrocketed 112.4% in a year, outperforming the 32.5% rally of its industry and the 12.4% rise in the Zacks S&P 500 Composite.SPOT has outperformed its streaming rivals Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN for the same period. Apple and Amazon have jumped 12.4% and 14.5% in the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceThe massive rise in Spotify shares may appeal to investors. However, the eminent question that lingers is whether it is the right to invest in SPOT.SPOT’s Growth Catalyst is Its User Base ExpansionSpotify demonstrated an impressive first-quarter 2025 performance, driven by user growth. The company added nearly 3 million monthly active users (MAU) and 5 million net new subscribers in a single quarter, portraying its ability to attract and retain users globally. This growing user base acts as a vital asset for revenue growth in the future. It not only boosts direct premium subscriptions but also enhances the potential to monetize its ad-supported tier.This strong user rise lays a solid ground for positive developments. Latching onto its continued scalability, the company reinforces its network effects, attracting more users and content creators. Also, Spotify’s CEO’s aspirational vision of touching 1 billion subscribers shines a light on its long-term growth trajectory.The company can improve its top and bottom line by a huge margin, given that it can achieve the desired number and can exercise strategic price adjustments in mature markets. Initiatives like the Spotify Partner Program, targeted at onboarding more video podcasters, hold the potential to widen the platform’s content offerings. This will also attract a wide audience and fuel further MAU growth and engagement in the long run.Spotify is well-positioned to zoom past its competitors and become the dominant audio streaming platform by capitalizing on its user base expansion, and tactfully investing in monetization and content strategy.Spotify’s Promising Top & Bottom-Line ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPOT’s 2025 and 2026 revenues is pegged at $19.9 billion and 22.8 billion, implying 17.4% and 14.3% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus estimate for Spotify’s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share stands at $9.88 and $13.69, suggesting 66.1% and 38.5% year-over-year increases, respectively.SPOT’s Liquidity Position Lags IndustrySpotify’s current ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2025 stood at 1.48, which sets a good tone for investors. However, something that can raise concern is its stance when compared with the industry average. Currently, the industry average is 2.54, which is substantially higher than SPOT’s current ratio. Adding to this concern, the metric has declined 21% from the preceding quarter. If continued, it can hurt the company’s liquidity position. Intense Competition Hurts SpotifyApple Music and Amazon Music are the most notable competitors of Spotify. The financial strength of these companies is something to look out for. These major players can use their financial prowess to reduce streaming prices, and lower or limit content availability, thereby hurting SPOT’s monetization strategy.Such an incident can bleed into hurting the company’s stock price. Strong reliance on third-party content licenses exposes Spotify to royalty cost hikes, affecting margins as the company expands its content offerings to include audiobooks and video.SPOT Stock Looks PriceySpotify’s stock price increase led to elevated valuations. It is priced at 56.1 times forward 12-month earnings per share, which is higher than the industry’s average of 37.8 times. When looking at the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA ratio, Spotify is trading at 62.1 times, far exceeding the industry’s average of 13.5 times. Spotify: Wait & WatchSPOT’s user base expansion is the key to success as it positions the company well for revenue growth. The company provides a strong top and bottom-line outlook, which favors its long-term growth objective.Spotify’s robust liquidity position reaffirms its financial strength. However, the market in which the company operates poses a substantial threat to its performance. Adding to this concern is its premium valuation, hurting investor sentiment.We recommend investors take a cautious approach and initiate a “Hold” strategy. Increasing exposure is suggested after signs of lasting growth and a more attracting valuation appears.Spotify carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

Funds Kept Shifting Out of U.S. Stocks as Rally Picked Up — Barrons.com,1747134600000,"By Brian SwintEven as stock prices rose over the past month, fund managers continued to shift money away from U.S. equities.That's one counterintuitive reading from the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey on Tuesday. Investors are a net 38% underweight U.S. stocks in May, more so than a month earlier, the report showed. At the same time, they're the most overweight euro-area equities versus the U.S. since October 2017.That suggests many may have missed the rally as the S&P exited a correction and the Nasdaq entered a new bull market. The survey was conducted from May 2 to May 8 — before this week's news that the U.S. and China will sharply reduce tariffs for 90 days as trade talks continue.Other results were less surprising. Traders are less bearish — in other words, they aren't as likely to expect stocks to fall. They've decreased allocations into cash and fewer think that a recession is likely this year. After yesterday's rally, the S&P 500 is up more than 8% over the past 30 days.However, one safe-haven play is still popular. Fund managers said that buying gold was now the most crowded trade for a second month.

European regulators crack down on Big Tech,1747317006000,"European regulators have launched a series of investigations into Big Tech in recent years.Here are some of the actions taken:DIGITAL SERVICES ACTTech companies are required to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content on their platforms under the EU's Digital Services Act that came into effect last year.Social media app TikTok was charged by the European Commission on May 15 for failing to comply with the DSA's obligation to publish an advertisement repository that allows researchers and users to detect scam advertisements, with its owner ByteDance now at risk of a fine of as much as 6% of its global turnover.This marks only the second ruling by EU tech regulators following the introduction of the DSA, after Elon Musk's social media network X was charged with breaching its content rules last year.Meta's Facebook and Instagram are being investigated for potential breaches of EU online content rules relating to child safety, which could lead to hefty fines, the Commission said in May 2024.DIGITAL MARKETS ACTThe European Union's Digital Markets Act took effect in 2022 with the aim of curbing the power of Big Tech and ensuring a level playing field for smaller rivals.Apple NASDAQ:AAPL was fined 500 million euros ($570 million) and Meta NASDAQ:META 200 million euros under the DMA on April 23. People with direct knowledge of the matter had in March said the fines would be modest, as the antitrust enforcer was focused on making sure companies comply with the law rather than sanctioning them.The investigations were part of three probes started by the European Commission, which acts as the EU competition watchdog.The EC is also investigating Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google over possible breaches, and charged Meta last July for failing to comply with the DMA in its new pay or consent advertising model.In September 2023, the EU named 22 ""gatekeeper"" services run by Alphabet, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Apple, Meta, Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and TikTok-owner ByteDance, giving them six months to comply with the provisions of the DMA.Meta and TikTok appealed against the gatekeeper status in November 2023, with the latter losing a bid to suspend its designation in February 2024. Apple said in April 2024 it would continue to engage with the Commission to comply with the rules.ANTITRUSTThe European Commission fined Meta 797.72 million euros in November for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.In September, Google won its challenge against a 1.49-billion-euro antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising.A week earlier, Google lost its fight against a 2.42-billion-euro fine by EU antitrust regulators seven years ago for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.On the same day, Apple lost the fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, as part of a larger crackdown against sweetheart deals between multinationals and EU countries.Regulators said last July that Apple had agreed to open its tap-and-go mobile payments system to rivals to settle an EU antitrust probe. Brussels fined Apple 1.84 billion euros in March 2024 for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.The Commission in June charged Microsoft with illegally bundling its chat and video app Teams with its Office product. It is also probing Microsoft's security software practices, a document seen by Reuters showed in February. EUROPEAN STATESIndividual European countries have also taken actions against Big Tech.Apple lost an appeal on March 18 against a regulatory assessment that opens it up to stricter controls in Germany, following years of debate over its market position.Britain's antitrust regulator in September provisionally found Google had abused its dominant position in digital advertising to restrict competition. A month earlier, it started probes into its parent Alphabet and Amazon's collaboration with AI startup Anthropic.Other measures include a fine against Meta in Italy over unfair commercial practices and a French fine against Google for breaching EU intellectual property rules.A Spanish regulator, meanwhile, opened an investigation into possible anti-competitive behaviour by Apple's App Store in July.($1 = 0.9060 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RN1B8:0-european-regulators-crack-down-on-big-tech/"

Responding to the trade deal, MAGS ETF surged 5.8% on May 12. The ETF has, in fact, surged 12.9% over the past month.The recent rebound follows a rough period for Big Tech after President Donald Trump announced a ""reciprocal tariff"" plan on April 2, which wiped out $2 trillion in cumulative market cap from the Magnificent Seven.Mag-7 Stock Performance Highlights Post US-China Trade TruceAmazon and Meta Platforms spearheaded a significant rally among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks on May 12 afternoon, following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China.Stock Performance Highlights Amazon surged 8.1% and Meta climbed 7.9% on May 12. Tesla gained 6.8%, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion. Apple rose 6.3%. NVIDIA jumped 5.4%. Google shares increased 3.4%. Microsoft added 2.4%.Trade Truce DetailsThe United States agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on Chinese imports. The United States cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered American levies from 125% to 10%.These reductions will last 90 days, following two days of high-stakes talks between the two nations. The new tariffs on small packages sent from China worth up to $800 have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement.Bullish Outlook for Tech SectorThe trade development is highly optimistic for tech stocks, particularly due to the easing of supply-chain concerns. Along with Apple, Tesla is also heavily dependent on Chinese parts and battery suppliers. No wonder, both shares surged. Moreover, Tesla is expected to debut its self-driving Taxi in June.Impact of China on Big TechAmazon : 30% of product value on its platform comes from China; Chinese advertisers made up 14% of ad revenues in 2024, per Raymond James, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Meta : Chinese advertisers contributed roughly 11% of total ad spending, Raymon James noted.Google : Chinese advertisers accounted for about 6% of ad revenues, Raymon James indicated.Apple : 90% of iPhones are manufactured in China, representing 17% of 2024 revenues .NVIDIA : Chinese clients make up between 20% and 40% of the company’s end customer base, according to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Any Wall of Worry?Despite the temporary truce, the United States has imposed export bans on NVIDIA’s H20 AI chips to China, which has pressured NVDA shares.

Best Gig Economy Stocks to Monitor Amid its Growing Popularity,1747313580000,"An updated edition of the March 25, 2025 article.The emergence of the gig economy concept has reshaped the landscape of traditional employment. The gig economy offers workers the freedom and flexibility to set their work hours, workload, and even their workspace. The resultant flexibility helps accommodate diverse lifestyles and personal commitments. No wonder this trend gained immense popularity, both during and in the post-pandemic scenario, with workers and companies constantly seeking more flexible and innovative work arrangements.The gig economy concept encourages workers to engage in short-term, freelance, or contract-based work. The advantages associated with the gig economy are being utilized by multiple companies, ranging from rideshares like Uber UBER and Lyft LYFT to food delivery entities like DoorDash DASH. Moreover, platforms like  Upwork  UPWK and  Fiverr  FVRR connect skilled freelancers with businesses for short-term projects, in turn allowing professionals to choose their schedules.Agreed that this flexibility comes at the cost of job security and benefits like healthcare and retirement plans associated with traditional employment. However, the lure of being one’s own boss often overrides these disadvantages. With a focus on work-life balance, the gig economy concept is gaining immense popularity. This can be gauged from the fact that the gig economy market is expected to reach $648.8 billion in 2025 and $2.15 trillion by 2033, from $556.7 billion in 2024. This implies that the market is likely to witness a compound annual growth rate of about 16.2% in the 2025-2033 timeframe.These numbers showcase the immense potential for gig economy-focused companies.

'De minimis': the trade perk Trump ended as part of China tariffs,1747130721000,"The Trump administration ended U.S. duty-free access for low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong on May 2, removing the ""de minimis"" exemptions used by Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods. Following talks in Geneva between China and the U.S. aimed at cooling a trade war, the White House on May 13 released its latest tariff rates for small packages valued at up to $800. These items sent from China to the U.S. via postal services are now subject to a tax of 54% of the package's value, or a flat fee of $100 per package. This is significantly lower than the 120% tariff that had been levied on packages from May 2. Trump accuses China of unfair trade practices and blames it for a crisis over the deadly drug fentanyl.WHAT IS DE MINIMIS?De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, describes the U.S. waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on imported items worth less than $800 that are shipped to individuals.It is one of the most generous such exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156). The U.S. has used de minimis since 1938 to reduce administrative burdens. During Barack Obama's presidency, Congress quadrupled the waiver from $200, facilitating an explosion in the number of exempted packages entering the country. Shipments claiming de minimis have soared more than 600% over the past decade to over 1 billion items in fiscal 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection data.WHY IS DE MINIMIS CONTROVERSIAL?Contentions largely concern U.S. trade imbalances and the synthetic opioid fentanyl - which is fuelling a national epidemic that killed nearly 75,000 people in 2023.Reuters reporters last year found they could easily import the core precursors for at least 3 million fentanyl tablets - with a potential street value of $3 million – at a cost of $3,607.18. The shippers mislabelled the packages as, for instance, electronics.Legitimate products, too, are controversial as Trump ramps up his rhetoric against China, with which the U.S. has its largest bilateral trade deficit, at $279 billion as of 2023.Big beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, PDD Holdings-owned NASDAQ:PDD Temu and Alibaba's NYSE:BABA AliExpress. Their growth prompted U.S. rival Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.Shein declined to comment on possible changes to U.S. de minimis policy. In 2023, the company called for de minimis reform ""to create a level, transparent playing field – where the rules are applied evenly and equally"". Temu, AliExpress and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.Critics of de minimis also say it lets companies evade tariffs on Chinese goods and customs inspections under a law banning products made with forced labour.CHINA GDP IMPACTChina exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.The brokerage forecasts that eliminating the U.S. threshold would slow Chinese export growth by 1.3 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2 point, with a significantly bigger hit if Europe and Southeast Asia also removed their minimum requirements for customs duties.China's most exposed sectors include apparel, which makes up 35% of China's direct-to-consumer exports by value, consumer electronics at 22%, home decor at 17% and beauty products at 7%, Nomura reckons.($1 = 0.9639 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL0AU:0-de-minimis-the-trade-perk-trump-ended-as-part-of-china-tariffs/"

US slashes 'de minimis' tariff on small China parcels to as low as 30%,1747121828000,"The U.S. will cut the ""de minimis"" tariff for low-value shipments from China to as low as 30%, according to a White House executive order and industry experts, further de-escalating a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies. The order published late on Monday offers some relief to big Chinese e-commerce players Shein and Temu NASDAQ:PDD and follows a weekend deal between Beijing and Washington to unwind for 90 days most of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on each other's goods since early April.While their joint statement following talks in Geneva did not mention the de minimis duties, the order signed by President Donald Trump said levies for those direct-to-consumer postal shipments will be reduced to 54% from 120% for items valued at up to $800, starting on Wednesday. An alternative flat fee of $100 per postal package remains in effect, but a planned June 1 increase to $200 was cancelled.There are different rules for packages handled by commercial delivery firms such as United Parcel Service NYSE:UPS , FedEx NYSE:FDX and DHL XETR:DHL , which shipped millions of Shein and Temu packages before Trump ended duty-free status for Chinese shipments valued under $800.The rate for those packages now defaults to the reduced U.S. tariff rate of 30% from 145% for Chinese imports, two delivery experts told Reuters on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.The 30% rate reflects the Trump administration's decision to cut China's ""reciprocal"" duty rate to 10% from 145%, plus a separate 20% duty related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis. The White House and the U.S. Trade Representative's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Tuesday that the 10% global duty rate would likely remain in place to help rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.COLLECTION DIFFICULTIESCommercial shippers generally collect duties from sellers in China prior to shipment, but the U.S. Postal Service is not set up to handle tariff collections. Four sources told Reuters most Temu and Shein shipments are handled by commercial carriers.Many consumer goods from China in the commercial channel will still be subject to much higher duties imposed under previous trade actions or sectoral national security investigations. For example, syringes and surgical gloves are subject to 100% duties under a U.S. Section 301 trade action.One of the delivery experts said, however, that if shipped by a postal carrier in quantities valued at less than $800, they may be able to arrive in the U.S. for only a $100 fee, or an effective 12.5% rate. In February, Trump ended the de minimis exemption and imposed different rules for packages handled by postal services or commercial delivery firms - blaming the exemption for enabling a flood of shipments from Chinese e-commerce firms and traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.The number of shipments entering the U.S. through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.According to 2024 congressional testimony from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, the average value of a de minimis shipment during fiscal year 2023 was just $54.Chinese online retailers Shein - which is considering a London stock market listing - and PDD Holdings-owned NASDAQ:PDD Temu, as well as U.S. rival Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.Jianlong Hu, CEO of Brands Factory, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce consultancy, said a 54% tariff was still very high.""Sellers are probably taking a wait-and-see approach but in general I think it's fair to say the boom times of small package delivery from China to the U.S., the Golden Age is already gone.""Shein is more exposed to de minimis changes due to its reliance on speed of getting thousands of new styles each week to consumers in the West by air than others such as Temu. Shein might still be one player that would want to send by air freight some packages from China and pay the 54% tariff rather than import all by boat, said Hu. ""If people are buying clothes on Shein and are told the product will arrive one month later, who will buy that?""LOOPHOLEChina's yuan FX_IDC:USDCNY jumped to a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, joining a global rally in riskier assets following the broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington.Trump's global trade war , which shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade for decades, has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession. The U.S. de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers as a loophole that allows Chinese products to skirt U.S. tariffs and illegal drugs and fentanyl precursors to enter the U.S. unscreened, as Reuters reporting has confirmed.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL079:0-us-slashes-de-minimis-tariff-on-small-china-parcels-to-as-low-as-30/"

The move comes several hours after Beijing and Washington announced a truce in their trade spat after weekend talks in Geneva, with both sides agreeing to unwind most of the tariffs imposed on each other's goods since early April.While their joint statement in Geneva didn't mention the de minimis duties, the White House order released later said the levies will be reduced to 54% from 120%, with a flat fee of $100 to remain, starting from May 14. The de minimis exemption, for items valued at up to $800 and sent from China via postal services, were previously able to enter the United States duty free and with minimal inspections. In February, President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption by imposing a tax of 120% of the package's value or a planned flat fee of $200 - set to come into effect by June - blaming it for being heavily used by companies such as Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.The number of shipments entering the U.S. through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.Chinese online retailers Shein, PDD Holdings-owned NASDAQ:PDD Temu and U.S. rival Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In Monday's order, the White House said the reduced tariffs will take effect by 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT)on May 14, 2025. The plan for a $200 flat fee duty rate would also be shelved, it said, keeping it at $100. BREATHING ROOMThe U.S. de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Some have derided it as a loophole that allows cheap Chinese products to flood into the United States and undercut American industries, while also serving as cover for smuggling contraband such as illegal drugs and their precursor chemicals.De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance which describes the U.S. waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs, was one of the most generous exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156).The Geneva agreement slashed tariffs for both the United States and China by 115 percentage points, to 10% and 30%, respectively, for at least 90 days. The tariff pause will give online retailers like Shein and Temu breather space to adapt their businesses, say industry experts, as online retailers are likely to use the time to bring in bulk shipments and restock their U.S. warehouses. Big beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba's NYSE:BABA AliExpress. Their growth prompted Amazon to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL04Z:0-us-to-cut-de-minimis-tariff-on-china-shipments-bolsters-broader-trade-truce/"

Nike's Air Force 1 shoes, which cost $155, are exempt from the increase, CNBC reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.With the critical back-to-school shopping season fast approaching, the company will maintain current prices for children's products, the report added.Nike's products on Amazon are currently sold by independent merchants, and the footwear maker stopped selling on Amazon after two years on the platform in 2019, as it shifted focus to sales on its own websites and in stores.Amazon notified some of those merchants that it will ban them from selling certain Nike products beginning July 19 because it was working with Nike directly, the Information reported, citing a message sent to merchants by the company.German sportswear brand Puma XETR:PUM also said earlier this month it had reduced shipments from China to the U.S. and might increase prices in the country due to tariffs.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RT1J1:0-nike-to-raise-prices-by-next-week-to-return-to-selling-on-amazon-media-reports-say/"

Amazon Seals New Partnership With FedEx for Delivering Large Packages,1747088040000,"By Connor HartAmazon.com has added FedEx as a partner to deliver select large packages to homes for the online retailer, as the two companies find more ways to do business together after a previous split.""We've reached an agreement with FedEx to serve as one of several third-party partners to deliver packages to our customers,"" Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said Monday.He added that the Memphis, Tenn., company will join other third-party partners including United Parcel Service and the U.S. Postal Service that regularly work alongside Amazon's last-mile delivery network to balance capacity.Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

"U.S., Chinese Markets Cruise on Cooling Trade Tensions",1747087260000,"Monday, May 12, 2025Markets posted one of its strongest sessions of 2025 so far. We’ve had a volatile first half of the year, and we might expect that volatility to continue. But with all the ups and downs, today’s big day into the green has brought the S&P 500 within 5% of its all-time trading high. The Dow and S&P 500 are within 1% of posting profits year to date.The Dow shot up 1160 points today, for a +2.81% gain — and it was the laggard among the major indexes. The S&P 500 grew +184 points, +3.26%. The Nasdaq, which one the day on strength in tech stocks, was up a whopping +779 points, +4.35%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained +68 points, +3.40%.Of course, the catalyst for this seismic shift comes from the agreement between the U.S. and China to pause their reciprocal tariffs (which had ballooned to +145% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and +125% on U.S. exports to China). Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META were both up +8% today, leading the way for “Mag 7” stocks.Chinese stocks also saw a bounce today, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining +3% today, for its best trading day since March. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar is back up to its one-month high, and Gold — which had been a demonstrative hedge when the equities market was melting away, just a few short weeks ago — is down -3% today.What to Expect from the Stock Market TomorrowThe big news tomorrow — though unlikely to make as big a splash as this tariff pause did today — is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April. Headline month over month CPI is expected to provide the biggest swing: +0.2% versus -0.1% reported a month ago, +0.3% on core versus +0.1% for March. Year over year, headline is expected to remain steady at +2.4%, and steady at +2.8% on core year over year.These figures, should they come in as expected, would still be notably above the optimal levels the Fed targets for inflation. Market strength and an absence of economic troubles that harsh tariff policies set in motion will likely keep any interest rate cuts at bay for now anyway, with the probability of a June rate cut tumbling from 64.4% to 8.1% today. The highest probability for the first cut of 2025 is currently the September meeting. Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Stocks to Watch as the U.S. & China Reach a Trade Deal,1747086840000,"Stocks surged on Monday as the U.S. and China announced a deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs, leading to much optimism that a global economic recession may be avoided.Easing an ongoing trade war, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, with China reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement will last 90 days, as the two sides work on building a sustainable, long-term trade relationship.The S&P 500 rose +3% in today’s trading session, with the Nasdaq spiking over +4%, as investors flock to big tech stocks that had sold off during rising trade tensions.The Mag 7 At the center of what has been a historic market rebound are the mega-cap big tech stocks, with Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Tesla TSLA leading the market gains on Monday and up over +6% respectively. It’s likely that analysts may become more bullish on Apple’s short-term outlook as most of the electronic giant’s production comes from China. A continued run-up in Apple, Amazon, and Meta stock looks fundamentally plausible, but it’s noteworthy that Tesla lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on a trend of declining earnings estimate revisions. Suggesting now may be a good time to fade the rally in Tesla stock is that TSLA has spiked +25% in the last month. Furthermore, Tesla has the highest P/E valuation among the Mag 7 at 161.4X forward earnings, with Alphabet GOOGL being the cheapest at 16.2X.Nvidia NVDA and Microsoft MSFT have started to gain nice momentum as well, although the latter was only up +2% today. Still, Microsoft is the only Mag 7 stock that currently has a buy rating with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the others all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) outside of Tesla’s strong sell rating. This comes as fiscal 2025 EPS estimates for Microsoft are up 2% over the last 60 days, with FY26 EPS estimates up 1%. Alibaba & TencentOptimistically, Chinese tech stocks have already benefited from higher investor sentiment before the tariff truce with the U.S., as Chinese President Xi Jinping has been more supportive of their independent growth. With regulatory issues being less of a concern to investors, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY are two Chinese tech stocks to pay attention to and currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Their ADR’s (American Depository Receipts) have been two of the top performers on U.S. stock exchanges this year, with BABA soaring nearly +60% year to date and TCEHY up over +20%. The strong price performance has been due to their artificial intelligence expansion, leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience, as Alibaba has seen higher e-commerce sales, and Tencent has benefited from growth in its gaming and cloud services. Retail Stocks Outside of Amazon and Apple, retailers like Nike NKE, Starbucks SBUX, and even Walmart WMT and Target TGT rely heavily on supply chain operations from China. Nike and Starbucks also generate a significant portion of their revenue from their operations within China, which would make better trade and political relations between the U.S. and China beneficial to their outlook.Nike and Walmart stock stand out with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Starbucks and Target have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Plus, China accounted for 14% of Nike’s revenue in 2024, with $5.5 billion coming from footwear sales alone, as shown in the chart below.Image Source: StatistaEnergy & Transportation Stocks Energy and transportation stocks will also be important to watch, as they could receive a continued boost in the following weeks thanks to today’s trade agreement. While geopolitical tensions can often cause an uptick in crude oil prices, the trade war between the U.S. and China had an adverse effect in regard to how the market saw future demand for travel and other activities that require higher energy production. Crude prices were up as much as +2% to over $62 a barrel but are still down 20% in 2025.Image Source: Trading Economics Bottom Line The U.S. and China trade agreement gave the market what it was looking for, as investors now have more reassurance that the global economy will be less impacted by higher tariffs. That said, keeping an eye on the progress that is hopefully made in the next 90 days will be critical, considering the U.S. and China are the world's two largest economies.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7a4eb6869094b:0-stocks-to-watch-as-the-u-s-china-reach-a-trade-deal/
Nordstrom Stock Just Delisted. Macy's and Dillard's Are the Department Stores Left Standing. — Barrons.com,1747855320000,"By Teresa RivasAnd then there were two.Macy's and Dillard's are the only publicly traded traditional, mall-based department stores now that Nordstrom's has gone private.JWN is no more. After years of will-they-or-won't-they speculation and failed deals, the Nordstrom family finally found a buyer for their Seattle-based retail chain — and the stock was delisted on Wednesday.The acquisition, announced near the end of last year, is an all-cash acquisition priced at $24.25 a share in partnership with Mexican department store operator El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. The Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company and Liverpool will own the other 49.9%.The Nordstrom family had owned about a third of Nordstrom's shares outstanding and Liverpool had owned approximately 10%. The deal, which shareholders signed off on earlier this month, includes a special dividend of 25 cents.That's a far cry from the $50 per-share offer the family had made in 2018. Then again, the retail landscape has essentially been transformed. One of the few constants is the incredibly shrinking footprint of the department store.Today, just Macy's and Dillard's are the stocks for those who want to invest in the true traditional department store.Once a mainstay of American retail, department stores were KO'd by e-commerce and discounters like TJ Maxx and Marshalls.Most went down for the count — remember Barney's? — though a few of the old names got back up but are beyond dazed. J.C. Penney and Sears operate a handful of stores postbankruptcy, and Lord and Taylor and Mervyns live online only.So it's up to Macy's and Dillard's to carry on the fight.Macy's has never retaken its 2015 all-time high. The stock is down about 40% in the past year, leaving it with a market cap of $3.3 billion. An accounting error that paid executives too much didn't help. Only 14 analysts tracked by FactSet still cover the stockand 70% of them rate it at Hold or the equivalent.Dillard's, with a market cap of $6.4 billion, actually has a stronger punch. True, only four analysts track the stock and not one is bullish on it. But the stock has defied the naysayers, hitting all-time highs earlier this year. The company's one-two combo of cost discipline and focus on higher-margin categories is allowing it to deliver a string of better-than-expected results.Kohl's is sometimes counted as department-store stock. However, the company has always favored off-mall locations. For a time, that strategy, along with partnering with Amazon.com to accept its returns, allowed it to outperform other department stores.In the past year, though, stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value — hurt by the firing of its CEO and disappointing results. The company lost a chance to be acquired for more than $60 a share in 2022, and now changes hands for $8.Life for department stores is rough — and has been for the past decade. Maybe even longer. The American shopper wants to buy online and get rock-bottom prices, which explains the rise of the discounter.Even catering to the well-to-to hasn't shielded those great retailers, as evidenced by companies like Neiman Marcus and Henri Bendel.So Macy's and Dillard's are left to go it alone. Nordstrom keep getting jabbed at by shifting tastes and tariffs and online stores — both here and abroad — but at the least it won't have to share the details of that fight every quarter.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The Memphis-based delivery company said the multi-year agreement covers residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.The deal with FedEx, signed in February, gives Amazon ""cost favorability"" compared with delivery rival UPS, Business Insider had reported, citing an internal document.The agreement will not replace UPS, Amazon said as FedEx will join its third-party partners, including UPS and the USPS, and work alongside its own last-mile delivery network. FedEx called it a ""mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement"" in a statement. The deal may signal a thaw in relations between FedEx and Amazon. The companies cut residential delivery ties in 2019 as Amazon was building its now sprawling network of delivery services.UPS NYSE:UPS said in January it plans to shrink shipment volumes for Amazon, its largest customer, by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 to focus on fewer, but more profitable deliveries.Late last month, UPS said it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as a part of its planned reduction in Amazon deliveries, as well as cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring.FedEx and UPS have been in a fierce battle for market share over the last five years, often poaching whole or partial customer accounts from the other.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1RT:0-amazon-signs-up-fedex-for-residential-deliveries/"

It closed out last week at $117.30, and then rose to $128.10 on Tuesday, after touching an intraday high of $130.60.The stock's success has also been tied to broader market sentiment around artificial intelligence. The so-called AI trade has come storming back in recent weeks. The Trump administration's pullback on tariffs has restored investors' tolerance, and enthusiasm, for riskier growth stocks.Palantir CEO Alex Karp also joined a group of tech leaders who accompanied President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia this week, where new AI deals were announced by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Amazon. Karp was likely there to talk about defense contracts.Palantir stock has been subject to ""on-again, off-again applause,"" on Wall Street, Barron's wrote in a recent feature on the company. ""The business has become the subject of great debate, ranging from Karp's views on Silicon Valley and politics to the scale of opportunity that lies ahead for the company's unique approach to software,"" Barron's wrote.Wall Street holds a wide range of views on the stock with analyst price targets currently ranging from $40 to $140.Since going public in September 2020, Palantir stock is up 1,262% for a 76% annualized return. The S&P 500 index has returned an annualized 11% over the same period.So far this year, Palantir stock is up 71%, versus flat performance for the large-cap index.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street Logs Best Day in More Than Four Weeks After US-China Tariff Pact,1747083713000,"Wall Street's benchmark indexes posted their biggest one-day gains in more than four weeks on Monday after the US and China agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. The Nasdaq Composite closed 4.4% higher at 18,708.3, the S&P 500 climbed 3.3% to 5,844.2, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.8% to 42,410.1. All three notched their biggest daily percentage gains since April 9. Barring utilities, all sectors ended in the green, led by consumer discretionary with a 5.7% gain. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties following their talks in Switzerland over the weekend. The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday he expects to meet with Chinese officials again ""in the next few weeks"" to continue trade negotiations, CNBC reported. The tariff cuts likely take a recession ""off the table for now,"" Wedbush Securities said in a Monday client note. Oxford Economics said that ""though the pause is temporary and risks to the outlook because of tariffs remain weighted to the downside, the agreement implies less of a drag on the economy through the rest of this year from three of the four shocks hitting it.""The so-called magnificent-7 group of stocks rallied, with Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN soaring 8.1%, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META advancing 7.9%, and Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA rising 6.8%.

Amazon strikes new partnership with FedEx after UPS pullback,1747082772000,"Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN said on Monday it has struck a new partnership with FedEx NYSE:FDX in late February to handle some parts of its package deliveries. FedEx shares rose 1.7% after the closing bell. Business Insider first reported the news on Monday, citing an internal document. The deal with rival FedEx gives Amazon ""cost favorability"" compared to UPS, the report said. UPS said in January that it plans to shrink shipment volumes for Amazon , its largest customer, by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. This is a part of the delivery firm's plan to focus on fewer, but more profitable deliveries. Late last month, UPS said it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as a part of its planned reduction in deliveries for Amazon. FedEx did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1Q7:0-amazon-strikes-new-partnership-with-fedex-after-ups-pullback/"

Currently available for a subset of U.S. customers, the company plans to expand to more products and customers in the coming months. Users can access these audio summaries by tapping the ""Hear the highlights"" button in the Amazon shopping app. Amazon has intensified its focus on AI integration across its business, recently revitalizing Alexa+, a voice assistant powered by generative artificial intelligence. The company has also integrated tools such as Rufus, its generative AI-powered shopping assistant that answers various shopping queries, and Shopping Guides, which provide guidance and product recommendations, onto its website. Tech companies have been rapidly deploying AI tech to consumers, spurred by the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot. Last month, OpenAI updated ChatGPT's web search capabilities to improve online shopping for users with personalized product recommendations with images, reviews, and direct purchase links.

"Alphabet Down 16% YTD: Are GOOGL Shares Buy, Sell or Hold on the Dip?",1747239240000,"Alphabet GOOGL shares have dropped 15.8% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s fall of 4.5%. The decline can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic conditions, moderating cloud growth, higher investments in developing cloud infrastructure and increasing regulatory headwinds.GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online this year, cloud revenues are expected to witness increased variability. The company expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, which is aimed at building up technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Alphabet expects advertising revenue growth to be lower due to a challenging year-over-year comparison. The company enjoyed solid growth in the financial services vertical in 2024.Regulatory headwinds like the lawsuit between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and GOOGL over Google Search are a concern. The DOJ argues that Google has inked anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine and plans to break up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android. DOJ’s proposal doesn’t bode well for Alphabet, given growing competition from AI-powered products like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity and Meta AI.Nevertheless, Alphabet’s focus on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud, driving top-line growth. Will AI focus drive Alphabet’s prospects this year? Let’s dig deep to find out.GOOGL Stock’s Performance  GOOGL’s Enhanced AI Usage to Aid ProspectsAt its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, GOOGL unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), expected to be available later this year. Google Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network (Cloud WAN), giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet showcased Willow, its new quantum chip, while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.Alphabet’s initiatives to infuse AI in Search are noteworthy. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Circle to Search was available on 250 million devices, with usage increasing roughly 40% during the quarter. Since October 2024, monthly visual searches with lens have increased by 5 billion. AI Overview is currently used by more than 1.5 billion people monthly. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview’s advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.In Cloud, Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and a low-code tool offering Agent Designer.Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination offers security offerings that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently. Wiz has a stellar clientele with its cloud security platform currently used by Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle. The Wiz buyout reflects the growing importance of Google Cloud in the company’s growth plans. The addition of Wiz to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing space. Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the first quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 22% and Google Cloud at 12%.Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Upward Trend for GOOGLThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $2.12 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 30 days, indicating 12.17% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.43 per share, up 7% over the past 30 days, suggesting 17.29% year-over-year growth.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteAlphabet’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.64%.GOOGL Stock is OvervaluedThe Value Score of C suggests a stretched valuation for Alphabet at this moment.Alphabet stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.74X compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry’s 4.8X.Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)GOOGL shares are trading below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.GOOGL Shares Trade Below 50-Day & 200-Day SMAs  ConclusionAlphabet’s growing GenAI capabilities and significant investments in cloud computing present a potential catalyst for the future amid stiff competition in the cloud space and increasing regulatory headwinds. GOOGL’s dominant position in the search engine market and strong position in the cloud are long-term drivers.Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Aramco says has US tie-ups worth up to $90 billion amid Trump Gulf tour,1747238890000,"Saudi Aramco TADAWUL:2222 said on Wednesday it had signed 34 preliminary deals with major U.S. companies, potentially worth up to $90 billion in a push to deepen commercial ties with the United States on the back of President Donald Trump's visit to the kingdom. The announcement was made a day after Riyadh pledged $600 billion in U.S. investments. Still, most tie-ups listed by the state oil giant were memorandums of understanding without a value attached. Some deals have also been previously announced, such as the agreement to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG per year for a 20-year term from NextDecade NASDAQ:NEXT . The agreements underscore Saudi Arabia’s efforts to strengthen its energy partnerships and attract foreign investment as it looks to balance oil dominance with broader industrial and technological growth under Vision 2030. ""The U.S. is really a good place to put our investment,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on Tuesday at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh. The forum coincided with Trump's four-day tour of the Gulf, marked by lavish receptions and a series of business deals, including $142 billion in arms agreements.Aramco is the economic backbone of Saudi Arabia, generating a bulk of the kingdom's revenue through oil exports and funding its ambitious Vision 2030 diversification drive.

Amazon vs. Oracle: Which Cloud Computing Stock is a Better Bet?,1747834920000,"In the high-stakes world of cloud computing, Amazon.com AMZN and Oracle ORCL represent contrasting approaches to capturing the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and enterprise computing. Amazon, with its dominant Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud platform, continues to leverage its first-mover advantage and massive scale, while Oracle positions itself as a specialized provider of database and enterprise applications with growing cloud ambitions through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.Both tech giants have made significant investments in AI infrastructure and services, attempting to capitalize on the transformative technology that's reshaping industries worldwide. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for AMZN StockAmazon's cloud division, AWS, delivered impressive first-quarter 2025 results with revenues climbing 17% year over year to $29.3 billion, establishing an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. This robust performance demonstrates AWS' continued market leadership despite increasing competition. Amazon's aggressive expansion of AI capabilities, including the deployment of next-generation P6-B200 instances powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, positions the company at the forefront of the AI revolution.The company's retail business also shows remarkable resilience with record delivery speeds and strong consumer engagement. Amazon has successfully regionalized its fulfillment network, resulting in faster deliveries and lower costs. According to CEO Andy Jassy, everyday essentials grew twice as fast as the rest of the business and represented one out of every three units sold in the United States.Amazon's strategic investments extend beyond domestic markets. The company recently announced a $5+ billion partnership with Saudi Arabia's HUMAIN to build a groundbreaking ""AI Zone,"" demonstrating its global ambitions. Additionally, Amazon has rapidly expanded its AI model offerings in Bedrock, incorporating leading models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek, creating a comprehensive AI ecosystem for developers and enterprises.The company's financial health is equally impressive, with first-quarter operating income growing 20% year over year to $18.4 billion. Amazon beat Wall Street expectations with EPS of $1.59, exceeding forecasts by 23 cents. The company's diversified revenue streams, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and subscription services, provide multiple growth vectors and natural hedges against market volatility.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 net sales is pegged at $693.74 billion, indicating growth of 8.74% from the prior-year reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.3 per share, which indicates a jump of 13.92% from the year-ago period.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for ORCL StockOracle's recent performance has failed to impress investors, with third-quarter 2025 results falling short of expectations. Revenues reached $14.13 billion, growing just 6.40% year over year but missing projections by $259.18 million. Similarly, EPS of $1.47 missed estimates by 2 cents, reflecting execution challenges in a highly competitive market.While Oracle touts its cloud growth, the reality remains that its total cloud revenues of $6.2 billion are dwarfed by AWS' $29.3 billion quarterly revenues. Oracle's infrastructure scale limitations are evident as the company struggles to meet demand, with executives repeatedly citing ""capacity constraints"" as hurdles to faster growth. Despite adding its 101st cloud region, Oracle lacks the global reach and availability zones that Amazon offers.The company's strategic focus appears scattered across multiple fronts — healthcare partnerships, financial services products, and government initiatives — without the coherent vision that Amazon demonstrates. Oracle's heavy reliance on its database business makes it vulnerable to cloud-native alternatives and multi-cloud strategies that bypass Oracle's traditionally high-margin offerings.Though Oracle highlights its Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) growing 63% to $130 billion, skepticism exists around conversion rates and timing. The company's guidance for 15% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 seems ambitious given its consistent execution issues and history of overpromising. Oracle's AI strategy centers around its database offerings rather than providing the comprehensive AI ecosystem that AWS delivers.The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.3% over the past 60 days.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteDespite management's claims about cost advantages for AI workloads, Oracle lacks the semiconductor investments and specialized infrastructure that Amazon has built. The company's relatively modest $16 billion annual CapEx pales in comparison to Amazon's infrastructure investments, raising questions about Oracle's ability to compete at scale in the capital-intensive cloud and AI markets.Stock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonBoth companies trade at premium valuations, but Amazon offers superior value considering its growth prospects. Amazon's forward P/E of approximately 30.66x is justified by its diversified revenue streams, market leadership in multiple high-growth sectors, and consistent ability to exceed earnings expectations. Oracle's forward P/E of 24.2x appears superficially cheaper but represents a questionable value given its slower growth and execution challenges.AMZN vs. ORCL: P/E F12M RatioAmazon's recent price performance reflects investor confidence, with shares climbing 3.5% year in the past 6-month period, outperforming Oracle which declined 16.6%. Oracle's relative valuation discount reflects legitimate concerns about its competitive position and ability to capitalize on the AI revolution at scale.AMZN Outperforms ORCL in the Past 6-Month PeriodAmazon's enterprise value to free cash flow ratio provides a more compelling investment case, especially considering the company's proven ability to reinvest cash flows into high-return initiatives. While both companies offer cloud exposure, Amazon's diversification and scale provide a significantly more attractive risk-adjusted return profile than Oracle's narrower focus and smaller operational footprint.ConclusionAmazon emerges as the decidedly stronger investment opportunity in the cloud and AI race. Its superior scale, comprehensive AI capabilities, diversified revenue streams, and consistent execution provide a compelling foundation for long-term growth. While Oracle attempts to position itself as a specialized alternative, its smaller scale, execution missteps, and fragmented strategy make it a distant second in the cloud wars. Investors seeking exposure to the transformative potential of cloud computing and artificial intelligence would be better served by adding Amazon shares to their portfolios while reducing or avoiding Oracle positions. Amazon's demonstrated ability to continuously reinvent itself and its leadership position in multiple high-growth markets give it unmatched potential for sustained outperformance. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), whereas ORCL has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c981bb8e7094b:0-amazon-vs-oracle-which-cloud-computing-stock-is-a-better-bet/

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold JD.com Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747234800000,"JD.com JD, the supply chain-based e-commerce giant in China, reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2025 results. Its revenues in the quarter increased 15.8% year over year to RMB 301.1 billion ($41.5 billion), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. The company reported non-GAAP diluted net income per share of RMB 8.41 ($1.16), which rose 48.8% year over year. The figure beat the consensus estimate by 10.48%. The solid performance can be attributed to improving consumer sentiment and continued enhancements in JD’s supply chain capabilities and user experience. The company’s strategic involvement in AI and robotics positions it for long-term growth. However, despite the long-term growth prospects, JD is facing several near-term headwinds, which should caution investors. Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the company to understand why investors should consider avoiding the stock till clearer recovery indicators emerge.JD Faces Pressures in the New Business SegmentJD’s new business segment posted a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB 1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025, despite an 18% year-over-year revenue increase. The loss was mainly driven by the aggressive expansion of its food delivery business, which is still in its early stages and failed to make a meaningful contribution to financial performance during the quarter.The food delivery initiative, although showing user traction, remains a drag on profitability. With operations only beginning to scale at the end of the first quarter, JD incurred significant costs without a corresponding revenue impact. The company remains in the early phase of developing its food delivery operations, with continued system improvements required to enhance both user experience and operational efficiency.JD’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.59 per share, which has been revised downward by 3.16% over the past 30 days, indicating 7.75% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2025 revenues is pegged at $172.07 billion, suggesting 7.04% year-over-year growth.JD.com’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 25.23%.JD.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusJD.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | JD.com, Inc. QuoteJD Operates in an Intensely Competitive MarketThe online retail industry in China is intensely competitive. JD.com’s current competitors in China include Alibaba BABA and PDD Holdings Inc. Sponsored ADR PDD. Globally, JD.com faces intense competition from the e-commerce behemoth Amazon AMZN. Alibaba commands roughly 80% of China’s e-commerce market, while PDD Holdings Inc. attracts consumers with aggressive discounts and group-buying offers. Amazon remains highly competitive in retail through its unbeatable pricing, wide selection, and convenience.Tough competition can hurt JD by reducing its profit margins, shrinking its market share, weakening its brand, or even causing big losses. When setting prices, the company has to look at what competitors are charging for similar products. If rivals lower their prices or offer extra perks, the company may have to do the same to stay competitive. Otherwise, it risks losing customers, which could hurt its business and financial performance.Some of JD’s current competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customer bases and higher penetration in the market, which poses a major threat to the company.JD Stock Price Performance and ValuationJD shares have returned 7.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s growth of 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500 index’s decline of 0.5% in the same time frame.However, JD has underperformed its industry peers, BABA and PDD. Shares of BABA and PDD have gained 55.3% and 23.2%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. Shares of AMZN have lost 3.6% in the same time frame. JD.com’s YTD Price Return PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, JD currently trades at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 7.94X, which is well below the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s 22.94X. This suggests that investors may be paying a lower price relative to the company's expected earnings growth.JD’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationConclusionJD.com delivered a strong first-quarter performance, but near-term prospects seem murky. Losses in its new business segment, particularly food delivery, and aggressive investments in AI, automation, and logistics are weighing on near-term profitability. The company’s latest move, launching an international all-cargo air route between Wuhu, China and Hanoi, Vietnam, adds to JD’s capital expenditure without offering near-term contribution. With earnings estimates trending downward and intensifying market competition, investors should consider exiting positions. Until clearer signs of recovery emerge, JD.com is best avoided.JD currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e42627330094b:0-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-jd-com-stock-after-q1-earnings-beat/

UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

C3.ai Trading at a Premium at 6.39X: Time to Hold or Sell the Stock?,1747760040000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector’s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai’s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels.

Criteo Stock Plunges 29% YTD: Should You Buy the Dip or Wait?,1747753140000,"Criteo CRTO shares have lost 29.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 1.4% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 0.7%. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry’s growth of 17.2% in the same time frame.The stock’s underperformance can be attributed to the effect of tariffs and inflation surrounding the industry. Criteo, although showing a dip at the moment, is poised for long-term growth even amid the macroeconomic uncertainties. The company is taking strategic steps to drive its prospects. Let’s take a closer look at how CRTO is laying the foundation for sustained growth.Strategic Shifts to Reinforce Retail Media and MonetizationCriteo has been transitioning from its legacy retargeting business toward high-growth areas, such as Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, Retail Media on-platform revenues grew 21% year over year, driven by increased advertiser and retailer demand. Off-platform monetization also grew, supported by a 60% increase in supply partners. This can be attributed to the company’s work with retailers like Michaels, Dollar Tree and Meijer, and its expansion of on-site monetization and self-service platforms.Commerce Audiences is another area of focus, with more than 250 brands onboarded to its expanded platform to date. With more first-party data integrations and growing demand for performance-based upper-funnel targeting, this business is positioned to scale throughout 2025.Criteo S.A. Price and ConsensusCriteo S.A. price-consensus-chart | Criteo S.A. QuoteCriteo’s Competition and How CRTO Stands OutCriteo operates in a crowded space, competing with tech giants like Amazon AMZN, Google GOOGL, and The Trade Desk TTD. Amazon uses its shopper data to sell ads directly on its platform, while The Trade Desk helps brands buy ads across the open Internet with data-driven tools. Google rivals Criteo with ads across Search, YouTube and websites, using its vast user data. Shares of Amazon, Google and The Trade Desk have lost 6%, 12.1% and 35.1%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. While these players dominate in various channels, Criteo differentiates itself by providing retailer-direct access and a transparent, demand-driven platform that aligns with first-party data needs. With its broad retail network, proprietary Shopper Graph, and AI-based performance engine, Criteo offers measurable returns to brands and retailers, an advantage it plans to expand upon through continued platform investment and innovation.CRTO’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRTO’s 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $3.46 per share, which has been revised upward by 8.46% over the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 16.98%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.41%.CRTO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 45.42%.Here’s Why You Should Buy CRTO Stock NowCriteo is now focusing on high-growth areas like Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, the company expanded its advertiser base by 11% year over year and drove strong platform adoption across key retailers like Michaels and Meijer. New features such as dynamic sponsored products and video ads have strengthened its product suite, while recent wins in categories like grocery and home improvement reflect growing market traction. With more than 250 brands using Commerce Audiences and self-service adoption rising, Criteo is building momentum. Backed by a clear product roadmap, the company is positioning itself for long-term success.CRTO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

Top Health & Fitness Stocks to Buy for the Wellness Boom,1747227420000,"An updated edition of the March 24, 2025 article.The health and fitness space has transformed into a thriving industry, fueled by growing public interest in leading healthier lives. More people are prioritizing wellness, pushing up demand for gyms, supplements, and holistic services. Tech has played a big role here — wearable devices and digital platforms have made it easier than ever to monitor progress and stay motivated. At the same time, rising concerns around obesity, chronic illness, and mental health are prompting even more individuals to adopt fitness-focused lifestyles.Tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN are leaning into this shift. Apple’s ecosystem includes the Apple Watch and its Fitness+ service, offering users real-time health data and guided workouts. Amazon is also making moves in healthcare with acquisitions like One Medical, combining artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools with virtual care. These efforts are reshaping how people manage their health, and in turn, accelerating industry growth.Looking ahead, the global health and wellness market is expected to hit around $1.1 trillion by 2034, at a steady 7.33% CAGR from 2025. Emphasis on preventive care, alongside corporate wellness programs and government-backed initiatives, is keeping the momentum strong. The rise of boutique fitness and premium wellness clubs is also opening the door for more specialized offerings. Consumers are shifting toward a more integrated view of health — where fitness, nutrition, and mental well-being go hand in hand — creating multiple revenue streams for brands in the space. Companies like Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, Hims & Hers Health HIMS and DexCom DXCM are the leading players in this movement.For investors, this trend presents a compelling long-term opportunity. As wellness becomes a top priority for more consumers, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health services is expected to grow. Our Health & Fitness Screen is designed to put the spotlight on high-potential stocks — like the four above — making it easier to find strong opportunities in this expanding market.Ready to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas? Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and discover your next big opportunity.3 Health & Fitness Stocks to Buy NowSprouts Farmers Market has carved out a strong niche in the specialty grocery space, putting fresh, natural, and organic products front and center. Its store design revolves around an open-market concept, where produce takes the spotlight. Surrounding it is a handpicked assortment of organic, plant-based, and gluten-free goods tailored to health-conscious shoppers. From fresh meats and dairy alternatives to vitamins and supplements, Sprouts offers lifestyle-focused choices. Its private-label Sprouts Brand has gained serious traction — generating over 23% of revenue in 2024 — by delivering exclusive, high-quality items at value-driven prices.Now operating 440 stores across 24 states, Sprouts continues to expand with a focus on smaller-format locations that bring fresh, premium food closer to communities. A key part of its strategy lies in logistics: the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is optimizing its supply chain by placing distribution hubs within 250 miles of most stores. This boosts produce freshness and supports local sourcing. At the same time, Sprouts is leaning into digital innovation with app-based ordering, delivery options, and personalized marketing, all contributing to a seamless omnichannel shopping experience.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sustainability is more than a buzzword for Sprouts — it’s woven into the company’s mission. In 2024, organic products made up 30% of total sales, while plant-based offerings climbed 27%. The company continues to prioritize responsible sourcing, food waste reduction, and carbon footprint management. Through its Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation, over $35 million has been invested since 2015 in nutrition education and food access programs. By combining eco-conscious practices with a commitment to health and wellness, Sprouts is reinforcing its role as a go-to grocer for mindful consumers. Hims & Hers Health has steadily evolved into a broad-based digital health and wellness platform, offering personalized solutions for conditions like hair loss, mental health, dermatology, weight loss, and sexual wellness. Their services are primarily delivered via telehealth, where customers access licensed providers through the company’s platform. These providers prescribe medications—both branded and compounded — which are fulfilled through Hims & Hers-affiliated pharmacies. In addition to prescription products, the company also offers over-the-counter health, skincare, and supplement items, many under their own brand, available online or through retail partnerships.Hims & Hers’ fitness and wellness offerings have expanded significantly in recent years, with notable moves into weight management. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company launched compounded semaglutide in mid-2024 and later added branded versions, tying into its broader telehealth weight loss program. New capabilities like a peptide manufacturing facility and a lab testing business (acquired in early 2025) aim to support long-term growth in this segment. These additions enhance their ability to provide medically-backed, personalized treatments for conditions such as obesity, testosterone imbalance, and sleep disorders — areas often tied to physical fitness and overall well-being.Underlying this expansion is a scalable tech platform that supports recurring subscription models and end-to-end care, from virtual consultation to medication delivery. Their approach reduces barriers like stigma and access limitations, particularly for first-time healthcare seekers. The platform’s structure allows Hims & Hers to respond quickly to growing demand for lifestyle-related care, positioning the company as a consumer-first health partner with a strong foothold in the digital fitness and wellness space.DexCom ’s health and fitness-related business centers around continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems designed to support people managing diabetes and those focused on improving metabolic health. Its core products — G6, G7, and the newly launched Stelo biosensor — offer real-time glucose tracking, mobile connectivity, and seamless data sharing via wearables like Apple Watch. The G7 system, with a smaller sensor and faster warm-up time, offers advanced alerts and an intuitive mobile app, while the over-the-counter Stelo targets adults with prediabetes and non-insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, broadening Dexcom’s reach into wellness and preventive care.Over the years, Dexcom has expanded beyond insulin-dependent users through strategic product development and partnerships. Its CGM systems are now integrated with insulin pumps and smart pens, allowing for semi-automated insulin delivery. More recently, Dexcom has collaborated with digital health players and consumer technology brands to make CGM data available in fitness platforms, extending usage beyond clinical diabetes management. These efforts are aligned with Dexcom’s broader vision of helping a wider population manage glucose levels and gain insights into their metabolic health.Dexcom’s platform continues to evolve, with development aimed at people who are obese, pregnant, or hospitalized. Their CGM systems are built for continuous use, replacing traditional finger-stick methods and offering wearable comfort and connectivity. Dexcom’s real-time APIs allow developers to integrate glucose data into various health and fitness applications. Through its advanced biosensors, predictive alerts, and growing focus on general health, #2 Ranked Dexcom is positioning itself as not just a diabetes tech leader but also a key player in the evolving health and fitness ecosystem.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cb7e459f2094b:0-top-health-fitness-stocks-to-buy-for-the-wellness-boom/

Amazon Commits $5 Billion on Saudi AI zone,1747226893000,"Amazon's NASDAQ:AMZN AWS is teaming up with Saudi startup Humain to roll out its AI servers, UltraCluster high-speed networks and Amazon Q app services throughout the Kingdom's new AI Zonethink state-of-the-art cloud power on Saudi soil. This follows AWS plowing $4 billion into Chile and underscores Amazon's playbook of planting local cloud and AI flagpoles in fast-growing markets. Saudi ICT minister Eng. Abdullah Alswaha called it the foundation for the intelligent era, and with AWS gear sitting in Humain's data centers plus joint training bootcamps for thousands of Saudi developers, it's clear both sides want to build an AI talent pipeline as big as the desert.But hey, all that swagger comes at a price. Amazon's $213.75 share tag sits a tad above most of its own valuation yardsticksGuruFocus pegs fair value at $170, and a cash-flow DCF puts it under $184. Even the median price-to-sales target of $201 lags today's quote, so you're basically paying up for future growth. The real conservative numbers (tangible book, Graham Number, FCF-based DCF) are way down in single digits, and balance-sheet metrics are in the red.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, SoundHound AI, Amazon.com and Alphabet",1747226220000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 14, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, SoundHound AI, Inc. SOUN, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?NVIDIA Corp. and SoundHound AI, Inc . have made significant inroads in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, boosting their stock prices over the last year. Both are targeting distinct AI segments, so let’s determine the one with greater gains.The Bullish Case for SOUN StockThe temporary trade agreement between the United States and China is good news for SoundHound AI stock. Tariffs on Chinese imports are lowered to 30% from 145%, and China has reduced the import duty on American commodities to 10% from 125%. The 90-day truce benefited companies with trade in the United States and China.Thanks to the deal with Tencent, SoundHound AI now operates in China. Tencent will integrate SoundHound’s voice AI into its cloud solutions for the automotive sector. As a software company, SoundHound AI may not be directly affected by tariffs; however, its cost of doing business rises significantly. Moreover, if tensions escalate, SoundHound AI may be blacklisted by China, impacting its partnership with Tencent.As more enterprise customers use SoundHound AI’s platforms, the company’s first-quarter 2025 revenues jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss in the first quarter narrowed by 14%. The company finished the quarter with positive cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. For full-year 2025, the company aims for 85% to 90% revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA.The Bullish Case for NVDA StockNVIDIA is poised to gain from the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alphabet Inc. These cloud computing companies are acquiring NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to boost computing power for AI workloads. Alphabet, in particular, said that growth from its AI products in the latest reported quarter was much higher than that of Google Cloud.By 2028, NVIDIA forecasts AI data center spending to hit $1 trillion, fueling stock growth. NVIDIA’s advanced chips are also in high demand, with shipments of its latest cutting-edge new-generation Blackwell chips surging by the day due to their faster AI interface and improved energy efficiency. Additionally, the popularity of the CUDA software platform has increased among developers and is expected to improve NVIDIA’s quarterly performance (read more: Can Palantir Stock be the Next NVIDIA, and Is It Worth Buying?).NVIDIA or SoundHound AI: Which Stock Has Greater Gain Potential?No doubt, the latest trade deal and widespread adoption of SoundHound’s voice-enabled AI systems are positives for the stock. However, the company is simply growing through acquisitions and less organically. If diverse corporate cultures don’t seamlessly blend, then it can be a hindrance to SoundHound AI’s growth story.SoundHound AI isn’t profitable yet and has often failed to meet its guidance, impacting the stock’s growth. Despite issuing positive EBITDA guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company’s adjusted EBITDA remained a negative $22.2 million five quarters later. On the other hand, NVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than the Semiconductor - General industry, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, higher than the industry’s 49.5%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has more room to scale upward.Furthermore, SoundHound AI lacks a competitive edge like NVIDIA has with GPUs. NVIDIA’s more than 80% market share in the GPU space will help the stock sustain market volatility, which could pose challenges for SoundHound AI. This indicates, NVIDIA can offer better and consistent gains in the near future. For now, both NVIDIA and SoundHound AI have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights C3.ai, UiPath, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",1747225740000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 14, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: C3.ai, Inc. AI, UiPath Inc. PATH, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:C3.ai or UiPath: Which AI Automation Stock Is the Better Buy Right Now?C3.ai, Inc. and UiPath Inc . are both high-profile players in the booming AI automation sector. C3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications, including predictive maintenance and generative AI tools, while UiPath leads in robotic process automation and is evolving toward “agentic AI” solutions. Both companies have seen recent momentum amid the broader artificial intelligence hype. In 2025, each presents a distinct case: C3.ai is smaller but growing faster, whereas UiPath is larger with more stable financials.These companies stand at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing trends—AI and digital transformation—making them compelling candidates for investors eyeing long-term technology disruption. Recent volatility in both stocks, coupled with evolving enterprise spending patterns and new product developments, has reignited interest in evaluating their investment potential. With macroeconomic uncertainty pressuring tech valuations and AI narratives driving short-term sentiment, now is an opportune time to assess which stock holds more promise.Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is the better investment at present.The Case for C3.ai StockC3.ai markets itself as an enterprise AI pure play, offering a suite of prebuilt, configurable AI applications that help large organizations implement predictive analytics, detect anomalies, and optimize operations. In theory, this makes its platform highly scalable across sectors. C3.ai has positioned itself as a pure-play enterprise AI software company, offering a broad portfolio of over 100 pre-built AI applications across various industries, including energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Central to the company’s growth strategy is its deepening alignment with major cloud providers and government institutions, designed to accelerate go-to-market efforts and extend distribution scale.C3.ai’s strengths center on its leadership in enterprise AI. The company claims first-mover status in “model-driven” AI applications, having expanded across numerous industries (19 in total) and the U.S. federal government, where federal revenues grew more than 100% in fiscal 2024. The company has secured large customers and pilots — recent announced deals include oil & gas supermajors, the U.S. Navy, BASF and multiple state/local governments. Strategic partnerships bolster C3.ai’s reach.For example, C3.ai is the most sought-after AI application on Microsoft ’s Azure cloud marketplace. It has a tie-up with Alphabet ’s Google Cloud and Amazon ’s Amazon Web Services. Since announcing an expanded alliance with Microsoft in late 2024, C3.ai closed 28 new deals through joint engagements, spanning nine industries. Sales cycles withMicrosoft have shortened by approximately 20%, a testament to the strength of their joint go-to-market motions. As of the fiscal third-quarter end, C3.ai and Microsoft were engaged in more than 600 active enterprise opportunities globally. These factors suggest that there will be continued opportunities as companies seek AI tools to streamline processes and decision-making.In its fiscal third-quarter results, C3.ai reported total revenues of $98.8 million, marking a 26% increase year over year. Subscription revenues grew 22% year over year to $85.7 million, constituting 87% of total revenues. The company closed 66 agreements, including 50 pilots, a 72% increase year over year.C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non GAAP loss of 12 cents per share). The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.Although cash reserves are large ($724.3 million at the fiscal third-quarter end), continued losses raise the risk of dilution or spending pressure. Competition is fierce – from other AI startups to tech giants building in-house AI solutions, which could pressure C3.ai’s growth or pricing. Growth also appears to be moderating after a surge in activity. Revenue growth rate decreased from 29% in the fiscal second quarter to 26% in the fiscal third quarter.The Case for UiPath StockUiPath operates in the adjacent, yet distinct, space of robotic process automation. Its platform automates rule-based, repetitive digital tasks—freeing up human workers and reducing costs for businesses. In contrast to C3.ai’s focus on predictive analytics and machine learning, UiPath emphasizes process optimization, task mining, and digital workflow orchestration. This has enabled it to gain broad adoption across banking, insurance, healthcare, and public sector clients.UiPath’s strengths lie in its market leadership and innovation. UiPath has a large global customer base and high retention (net retention approximately 110–115%), meaning existing accounts keep expanding. Management notes that 90% of surveyed enterprises see opportunities for agentic AI in their workflows, suggesting a large addressable market ahead. Furthermore, UiPath enjoys very high gross margins (85% non-GAAP in the fiscal fourth quarter) and has been streamlining its cost structure, supporting improved profitability.UiPath’s business and financial profile contrast sharply with C3.ai’s. UiPath is much larger and has recently been moving toward profitability. In fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31, 2025), UiPath reported revenues of $1.43 billion, up 9% year over year. In the fiscal fourth quarter (October 2024–January 2025), revenues were $424 million (up 5%). Its subscription and recurring model yields stable bookings — year-end Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $1.666 billion (up 14%).Crucially, UiPath generated a GAAP operating profit of $34 million in the fiscal fourth quarter (versus a year-ago loss) and $241 million of non-GAAP operating income for the full year. Free cash flow was robust, reaching $328 million in fiscal 2025. The company ended the year with about $1.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet and launched a $500 million share buyback program, announced during the fiscal second quarter. These figures point to a healthy, cash-generative model, despite modest growth.On the other hand, UiPath faces challenges. Its revenue growth rate has slowed to mid-single digits (10% in the fiscal second quarter, 9% in the fiscal third quarter, 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter) as large enterprises moderate spending. Global economic uncertainty — especially in the U.S. public sector — has pressured guidance. Competition is fierce: Microsoft (Power Automate), Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and even open-source tools vie for the automation market. UiPath remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis for the year (fiscal 2025 GAAP operating loss was $163 million), though it expects to sustain profitability going forward.Share Price Performance & Valuations for C3.ai, UiPath StocksPATH (up 3%) has performed better than AI (down 29.7%) so far in 2025. Over the past month, PATH has gained 22.2%, more than AI’s 20.6% rally.ValuationC3.ai is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7X, below its three-year median of 8.33X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 5.74X. PATH’s forward earnings multiple sits at 4.63X, below its three-year median of 6.41X. The C3.ai stock appears expensive when compared with the sector average and PATH.While both companies operate in the AI automation space, UiPath's valuation metrics suggest a more balanced investment profile, with expectations of future profitability and valuations in line with industry norms. C3.ai carries a higher valuation premium and lacks current profitability, which may present greater investment risk.Comparing EPS Projections: C3.ai & UiPathThe 2025 EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days for PATH stock while the same remained unchanged for C3.ai. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C3.ai’s 2025 bottom line suggests a 4.3% improvement, while that for PATH indicates a year-over-year decline of 1.9%.ConclusionBoth C3.ai and UiPath are positioned to benefit from the continued interest in AI-driven automation, but their risk/reward profiles differ. C3.ai offers higher growth potential, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicating 29.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, and first-mover advantages in the enterprise AI market. However, it is still unprofitable, burning cash. In contrast, UiPath is larger and almost cash-flow positive. It generates profits on a non-GAAP basis, boasts a strong balance sheet, and recently returned capital via a $500 million buyback.In a nutshell, C3.ai’s upside depends on sustaining rapid growth and successfully scaling new AI offerings, which is far from certain, given competition and macro risks. UiPath, while growing more slowly, has a more proven business model and valuation that is easier to justify. UiPath — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company - appears to offer better upside potential in 2025.Its combination of profitability, strong cash flow, and reasonable valuation makes it more resilient if growth disappoints. C3.ai — a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company — could outperform on strong AI tailwinds, but it is riskier and richly priced.

Forget the U.S. Downgrade. Here's What Really Matters to the Market. — Barrons.com,1747691580000,"By Ian SalisburyMoody's downgrade to the U.S.'s credit rating initially shook the market as it kicked off the week.The S&P 500 was down early Monday, before recovering to finish up 0.1%, as investors reacted to the firm's recent decision to strip U.S. sovereign debt of its triple-A credit rating.While psychologically jarring, history suggests the downgrade will have little impact on stock returns in the longer term. Instead, investors should focus on corporate earnings.""The history of U.S. sovereign debt rating agency downgrades spans +10 years and uniformly shows that these actions do not portend higher rates, recession, or lower stock prices,"" wrote DataTrek analyst Nicholas Colas in a note Monday. ""Over the last 20 years, 10-year Treasury yields were highest when America was AAA rated by all three agencies,""Indeed, Colas noted Standard & Poor's cut its rating on U.S. debt all the way back in 2011, and Fitch did so in 2023. Neither move ultimately scared investors away from Treasury bonds, which remained capital markets ultimate safe haven. Meanwhile the S&P 500 has enjoyed one of its best stretches in recent memory.A better way to gauge where stocks are headed may simply be to focus on corporate profits. There has been cause for worry there too, noted Morgan Stanley analyst Michael J. Wilson in a Monday note, but the picture is improving. One of Wilson's preferred gauges is ""earnings revision breadth,"" a sentiment measure which compares the number of downward earnings revisions issued by Wall Street stock analysts to upward ones.While the earnings revision breadth measure is still bearish, it's improved dramatically in the past few weeks. Wilson notes that breadth for the S&P 500 is now at -15%, up from a low of -25% in mid-April. If that trend continues, the S&P 500 could approach its mid-February highs.""The combination of upside momentum in revisions breadth and last week's deal with China has placed the S&P 500 firmly back in our pre-Liberation Day range of 5500-6100,"" Wilson wrote. ""We think continued upward progress in EPS revisions breadth back toward 0% will be needed to break through 6100 on the upside.""The S&P 500 hit its all-time high of 6144 on Feb. 19Among the sectors that have enjoyed the biggest rebounds are media and entertainment, materials, capital goods and tech hardware. By contrast, laggards with worsening outlooks include consumer durables, autos and consumer services.Citi analysts, for their part, are also bearish on consumer stocks, worrying about recent signs that spending by American consumers is slowing. On Friday, the University of Michigan reported its consumer sentiment index slipped to 50.8, its second-lowest reading in more than 40 years.""We have been [underweight] consumer discretionary and staples stocks this year as the U.S. consumer has been in the crosshairs of tariff policy risk,"" analysts wrote Friday. ""A worst-case policy impact has seemingly been alleviated, yet recent signs of consumer slowing are concerning.""Citi analysis recommended investors who do want to own consumer stocks pick and choose, with an emphasis on defensive names. To that end, they ran a screen hunting for individual stocks, with low cyclicality, high debt-to-capital ratios and high capital expenditures relative to deprecation.Among the names that came up: Walmart, Dollar Tree, Amazon and Procter & Gamble.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Stocks Inch Higher Pre-Bell as Traders Parse Inflation Data; Trump Repeats Call for Rate Cuts,1747222190000,"The main US stock measures edged up in Wednesday's premarket activity as investors digest the latest consumer price inflation report, while President Donald Trump again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were slightly in the green before the opening bell, while the Nasdaq increased 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished the previous trading session higher, while the Dow closed in the red. Government data on Tuesday showed that consumer prices in the world's largest economy rebounded last month, but missed Wall Street's estimates, while annual inflation eased to the lowest level since February 2021. ""There isn't a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the (consumer price index) in April, but this shouldn't be surprising as it takes time,"" Oxford Economics said Tuesday in remarks emailed to MT Newswires. The US and China recently reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties. The two countries had been in a trade war since Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The producer price index and the retail sales report, both for April, are out on Thursday. Wednesday's economic calendar has the weekly mortgage applications bulletin at 7 am ET, followed by the weekly EIA domestic petroleum inventories report. In a social media post late Tuesday, Trump repeated his call for the Fed to cut interest rates, saying there was no inflation and prices of gas, energy and groceries are down. Last week, the Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged and warned that upside risks to inflation and unemployment have increased. Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson is scheduled to speak at 9:10 am, while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly speaks at 5:40 pm.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

""The market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names,"" Wedbush said. President Donald Trump's Middle East trip culminated in deals for the delivery of 18,000 Nvidia chips to Saudi Arabia for a 500-megawatt data center and for the largest AI data center outside the US in Abu Dhabi, the report said. The announcements mark the ""start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,"" said the investment firm.

The tech boom in the Middle East ""also speaks to this global game of high stakes poker being played by the Trump administration"" as China faces US chip restrictions, the report said.

3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

UBER vs. GRAB: Which Ride-Hailing Stock is a Stronger Play Now?,1747663860000,"Uber Technologies UBER and Grab GRAB both provide ride-hailing services. The companies have revolutionized the transportation industry with their innovative business models centered on ride-sharing.However, the companies operate in different regions and have distinct approaches. While Uber operates globally, Grab is a leading provider of deliveries, mobility and digital financial services sectors in multiple cities across eight countries in Southeast Asia — Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Even though Uber’s primary business is ride-sharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time.Given this difference in approaches and geographical focus of the two companies, let’s examine closely to find out which one currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now.The Case for UberUber is based in San Francisco, CA. Uber’s ridesharing and delivery platforms are growing in popularity. This is generating strong demand, which, along with the latest growth initiatives and continued cost discipline, is driving the company’s results.In its recently released first-quarter 2025 results, Uber continued its streak of beating earnings expectations, showing resilience despite tough conditions.Uber Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUber price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Uber QuoteIn the June quarter, gross bookings are anticipated to be in the $45.75 billion - $47.25 billion range, indicating 16-20% growth on a constant currency basis from second-quarter 2024 actuals. The guidance includes an estimated 1.5 percentage point impact of currency headwind (including a roughly 3 percentage point currency headwind to Mobility).Earnings Estimates for UberUber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. By adopting this approach, Uber has been able to avoid the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. Moreover, Uber has engaged in numerous acquisitions, geographic and product diversifications, and innovations. Its endeavors to expand into international markets are commendable and provide it with the benefits of geographical diversification.Another area of confidence is Uber’s buyback strategy. In 2024, Uber generated a record $6.9 billion in free cash flow, with an adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Uber’s announcement to start an accelerated $1.5 billion stock buyback program highlights not only its shareholder-friendly strategy but also signals confidence in its ongoing business strategy. The $1.5 billion plan is part of the company's $7 billion buyback program announced last year.In 2018, Uber, which went public in 2019, sold its business in Southeast Asia to Grab. Uber has a significant stake in Grab.The Case for GrabGrab's ability to adapt to local conditions is a key contributor to its success in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Grab’s evolution from a taxi-hailing app into an ""everyday everything app"" offering various services, including food delivery, e-scooter rentals and digital payments, is commendable and highlights its desire to expand. Grab is benefiting from strong growth in its On-Demand Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”), expanding fintech offerings, and increasing user engagement across its platform. On-demand GMV refers to the sum of GMV of the mobility and deliveries segments. In the first quarter of 2025, On-Demand GMV increased 16% year over year. Grab expects 2025 revenues between $3.33 billion and $3.40 billion, indicating 19-22% year-over-year growth. Grab Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGrab price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Grab QuoteGrab is strengthening its position across Southeast Asia by partnering with  Amazon ’s AMZN cloud computing platform — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — to drive growth in mobility, deliveries and financial services.In December 2024, Grab selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate growth across its mobility, deliveries, and financial services verticals, including its digital banks. Grab has enhanced operational efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs and launched innovative services by utilizing AWS’ scalable, secure and cost-efficient cloud solutions.Earnings Estimates for GrabGrab Appears to Be More Pricey Than UberUber is trading at a forward sales multiple of 3.58, above its median of 2.54 over the last three years. Uber has a Value Score of D. Meanwhile, Grab has a Value Score of F, with its forward sales multiple at 5.78, above its 3-year median of 4.85.ConclusionUber’s expensive valuation (compared to its 3-year median) seems to suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for this dominant player in the ride-hailing industry. The company’s diversification efforts and shareholder-friendly approach attest to its financial bliss. Uber’s large size (market capitalization of $191.95 billion) positions it well to overcome uncertain times, such as the current one.Grab, on the other hand, has a much narrower geographical focus, making it highly susceptible to economic downturns, such as the current scenario. The economic uncertainty in key Southeast Asia markets, driven by factors like inflation, changing consumer behavior, and supply-chain disruptions, is hurting Grab. Moreover, Grab faces intense competition in its deliveries segment. The much smaller Grab, with a market capitalization of $20.5 billion, is not as shareholder-friendly, as its larger rival.On the basis of our analysis, Uber seems a better pick than Grab, despite both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfb690819094b:0-uber-vs-grab-which-ride-hailing-stock-is-a-stronger-play-now/
Equities Mixed as Investors Parse Inflation Data; Nvidia Leads Tech Rally,1747169830000,"US equity indexes ended mixed Tuesday as Wall Street digested official April inflation data, while technology stocks advanced led by Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA . The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6% to 19,010.1, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.7% to 5,886.6. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% to 42,140.4. Among sectors, technology paced the gainers, with a 2.3% jump, while health care saw the biggest drop of 3%. In economic news, US consumer prices rebounded last month, but missed Wall Street's estimates, while annual inflation eased to the lowest level since February 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. ""There isn't a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the (consumer price index) in April, but this shouldn't be surprising as it takes time,"" Oxford Economics said. ""The areas where tariffs likely boosted prices in April were in furniture/bedding, appliances, and to a lesser extent toys.""The US and China recently reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties. The two countries had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The official US producer prices report for April is scheduled to be released Thursday. Small business optimism in the US deteriorated for a fourth consecutive month in April as owners continue to grapple with macro uncertainty, a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business showed Tuesday. Uncertainty remained ""a major impediment"" for owners in April, impacting hiring plans, investment decisions and other aspects of business, NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said. US Treasury yields were mixed, with the 10-year rate edging higher by 0.9 basis point to 4.48% and the two-year rate easing 1.6 basis points to 4.02%. Nvidia, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google and Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD announced separate partnerships with Humain, an artificial intelligence company backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.

Amazon was up 1.3%, while Alphabet's class C and A shares gained 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The announcements come as the White House said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will invest $600 billion in the US, initially focusing on areas including energy, defense, technology and critical minerals. Trump arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday, with plans to visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates later in the week. First Solar NASDAQ:FSLR shares surged 23%, the top performer on the S&P 500, as Wolfe Research upgraded the stock to outperform from peer perform. UnitedHealth Group NYSE:UNH suspended its full-year outlook amid higher-than-expected medical costs, while the health insurance giant said that Andrew Witty stepped down as chief executive due to ""personal reasons."" The company's shares slumped 18%, the worst performer on the Dow and the S&P 500. Coinbase Global NASDAQ:COIN shares soared 24%. The stock's upcoming inclusion in the S&P 500 is expected to help boost institutional ownership in the cryptocurrency exchange, Oppenheimer said.

Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a0f366036094b:0-should-you-stay-invested-in-or-sell-coreweave-stock-post-q1-earnings/

Bear of the Day: United Parcel Service (UPS),1747641600000,"UPS Company OverviewBased in Atlanta, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock United Parcel Service ( UPS ) is the world’s largest express carrier and package delivery company. Founded in 1907, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. The company offers a range of supply chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions, and repairs. UPS transports millions of packages each business day across the globe. In 2024, the company delivered 22.4 million packages per day on average.UPS to Slash Amazon Business in HalfE-commerce juggernaut Amazon ( AMZN ) is UPS’s largest customer by far in terms of volume and revenue. Unfortunately for UPS, UPS Amazon deliveries are also some of the least profitable sides of the business, with tiny margins. Facing a dilemma, UPS management decided earlier this year to cut its Amazon delivery volume by more than 50% by the end of next year. While the bold move may reduce UPS’s reliance on Amazon and increase margins, it will be near-impossible to fill the gigantic volume void any time soon, leaving shareholders with more questions than answers.Weakness in Europe and Asia Persists Geopolitical uncertainty, global trade concerns, and poor consumer sentiment continue to contribute to the economic slowdown and slowing demand for UPS in Asia and Europe. With all the uncertainty, UPS forward guidance forecasts that revenue will be lower in 2025 in 2024.Unionization Means Higher CostsUPS is the largest employer of members of the “Teamsters” union. After a strike, UPS was forced to increase full-time workers’ pay significantly by $7.50 per hour. This deal has hurt the company’s profitability dramatically, and when the agreement ends in 2028, UPS is likely to have to increase pay even more or face another strike.Relative Price Weakness Versus the MarketRelative weakness is another major red flag for UPS. Year-to-date, shares are down 19.7% while the S&P 500 Index is down only 3.4%. In other words, UPS shares fell in tandem with the market but failed to recover with it.Bottom LineUPS faces significant headwinds as it navigates a complex landscape marked by a significant shift in its Amazon relationship, persistent weakness in key international markets, and increasing labor costs.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2666b3503094b:0-bear-of-the-day-united-parcel-service-ups/
Break Up Alphabet? It May Be the 'Only Way Forward' for Google Stock. — Barrons.com,1747167420000,"Al RootAlphabet faces regulatory and competitive headwinds weighing on the company's valuation. It might be time to break the tech giant up to ""unleash"" shareholder value.""The only way forward for Alphabet is a complete breakup that would allow investors to own the business they actually want — the top competitors to Netflix, Amazon Web Services/ Microsoft Azure, Trade Desk, and Uber/ Tesla,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in a Monday report.Alphabet, of course, is a conglomeration of many tech businesses, including Google Search, Waymo, Google Cloud, YouTube, and others. Alphabet has the Android operating system, its own foundational AI models, and designs AI chips that work with Nvidia processors.Google makes most of its money via advertising, which is why Luria included Trade Desk, which trades at about 45 times estimated 2025 earnings. YouTube competes for eyeballs with Netflix, which trades for 43 times estimated 2025 earnings. Waymo is pioneering self-driving taxi service like Tesla, which trades for about 150 times earnings. Cloud companies Microsoft and Amazon.com trade for about 32 times and 34 times earnings, respectively. Apple and Nvidia shares trade for closer to 28 times earnings.All of those multiples are far greater than Alphabet's 17 times multiple. The biggest reason for the discount is essentially OpenAI and its ChatGPT, which threatens the search business. Alphabet, of course, is responding with its Gemini product and AI summaries in the traditional search results.""The debate on search will not get better, and sum of the parts [valuation] only works if the company is willing to take action,"" added Luria. ""Investors want a big-bang breakup, not isolated spin-offs.""That is the key to unleashing higher valuation, he says. ""By keeping the conglomerate structure, management in dooming all of its businesses to the 16 times search multiple.""A big breakup is a bold idea. Whether the company will undertake it is anyone's guess. Alphabet didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Luria isn't the only one who thinks a breakup could help Alphabet. ""Google's true value is suffocating under its own scale,"" says The Edge research founder Jim Osman, whose firm specializes in analyzing spinoffs. ""Break it right, and YouTube, Cloud, and Waymo could each command a multiple the market isn't currently allowed to see. Great spin-offs create value long-term, but chaos often comes first.""Osman doesn't have a rating on Alphabet stock. Luria rates shares Hold, with a $160 price target for shares, but adds a breakup would make it a ""top megacap pick.""Overall, 84% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy, according to FactSet. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Alphabet shares is about $200.Alphabet stock rose 0.6% on Tuesday, closing at $159.93, while the S&P 500 added 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%.

Stephanie Link reveals her favourite retail stocks after April inflation data,1747487700000,"US retail stocks are in focus this week after the Bureau of Labour Statistics said that inflation was up slightly less-than-expected in April.Inflation data tends to be significant for retail stocks as it directly influences consumer purchasing power and overall business costs.According to Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist, a handful of the US retail stocks are particularly well-positioned to own after April’s CPI reading.Her top picks include Walmart, Amazon, and Costco.Walmart Inc NYSE:WMTWalmart missed revenue expectations in its fiscal first quarter and warned this week that it will begin raising prices in response to tariffs. The company cited increased import costs stemming from the US administration’s trade policies and indicated that consumers could start seeing the impact as early as the end of May.Still, Stephanie Link remains bullish as ever on the retail giant as a 4.5% increase in same-store sales in the US suggests “they’re crushing it.” Plus, the NYSE-listed firm is “being conservative on guidance,” she added.Link sees WMT as strongly positioned to absorb the tariffs-driven costs, thanks to its fortress of a balance sheet. On CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, she dubbed Walmart an all-weather stock as 72% of its sales come from consumables.Finally, a close to 1% dividend yield tied to WMT shares makes them all the more exciting to own in 2025.Amazon.com Inc NASDAQ:AMZNHightower’s chief investment strategist favours owning Amazon for retail exposure this year since it continues to grow its market share in eCommerce and has a strong presence globally.According to Stephanie Link, Amazon’s scale positions it well to absorb tariff-related increases in costs. This could even help insulate the multinational from rising competition from the likes of Temu and Shein.All in all, if the US economy “continues to chug along and the consumer doesn’t die,” investors will remain interested in Amazon stock in 2025, she argued in a recent interview.Note that AMZN shares are currently down more than 15% versus their year-to-date high, which makes them appealing in terms of valuation as well.Costco Wholesale Corp NASDAQ:COSTStephanie Link counts Costco stock among her top picks for 2025 as it’s exceptionally positioned to navigate an uncertain macro environment.She recommends owning COST this year for the strength of its membership model, as it’s known to drive customer loyalty that translates to consistent revenue streams.Additionally, the retail behemoth’s efficient supply chain and bulk pricing strategy help it maintain profitability even in challenging economic conditions. Like Walmart, Costco is a dividend-paying stock, currently offering a yield of 0.51%—another compelling reason to consider adding it to your portfolio.Wall Street agrees with Link on Costco stock as well, given the consensus rating currently sits at “overweight” with price targets going as high as $1,205, indicating potential upside of more than 20% from current levels.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:ae1d87a4c094b:0-stephanie-link-reveals-her-favourite-retail-stocks-after-april-inflation-data/
Amazon Encouraged Third-Party Sellers to Stockpile Ahead of Tariffs — Market Talk,1747163460000,"Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy has been encouraging the online retailer's third-party sellers to pull forward buying and stockpile inventory, a move he says will help keep prices low as the company looks to navigate new tariff policies. He warns, however, that pre-buying can be done in excess: ""If you end up with too much inventory in your fulfillment network, it really slows down your productivity,"" he says earlier this month on a call with analysts. CFO Brian Olsavsky notes that pre-buying contributed to higher costs during the recent quarter, but says these costs are expected to help keep tariff-related costs down in 2Q.

"In a Trade War, Walmart Lacks Some of Amazon's Ammunition — Heard on the Street — WSJ",1747474200000,"By Dan GallagherTwo American retail titans are on the front lines in President Trump's trade war. Investors seem to be betting that Walmart can dodge even more bullets than Amazon.Walmart used its fiscal first-quarter report on Thursday to warn that its prices are going up as products covered by new tariffs start hitting its shelves. That marred what was otherwise considered a strong report, with revenue rising nearly 3% from the same period last year and operating earnings exceeding Wall Street's forecasts.Wall Street doesn't seem too worried. Walmart's stock sold off sharply Thursday morning but quickly recovered. It has now risen nearly 2% since reporting earnings, putting it up around 53% over the past 12 months — well ahead of other retailers and trouncing Amazon's 12% gain over the same period.That has landed Walmart — the home of ""Always Low Prices"" — a rather rich multiple of 37 times projected earnings for the next four quarters, which is 40% above its three-year average, according to FactSet data. Amazon now trades around 33 times forward earnings.Such a premium leaves Walmart very little room for error in a world where so much can go wrong. Walmart noted Thursday that more than two-thirds of the goods it sells in U.S. stores come from the U.S. ""But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on the company's earnings call.""Narrow retail margins"" are a challenge for Amazon as well. But the company has spent many years building up ancillary and adjacent businesses such as cloud computing and advertising that provide far more financial firepower.That shows in the companies' respective income statements. Amazon and Walmart commanded similar gross margins in the mid-20% range a little over a decade ago, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Walmart's has stayed in that range, while Amazon's annual gross margin has nearly doubled — hitting 49% last year.To be sure, Walmart has done a commendable job of becoming more than just an enormous physical retailer. E-commerce revenue hit $32.5 billion in the April-ending quarter, up 22% from the same period last year and now making up 20% of the company's total sales. That has allowed Walmart to follow in Amazon's footsteps and build up new, higher-margin revenue streams from subscriber fees and advertising. Bernstein analyst Zhihan Ma says Walmart is on a ""fundamentally improved"" earnings trajectory over the long term.But Amazon is much further along that path. Note that while both companies are projected to hit roughly $700 billion in revenue this year, Wall Street expects Amazon's operating income to come in around 2 1/2 times that of Walmart's at more than $77 billion for Amazon, according to FactSet estimates.And that is even after factoring in the costs of Amazon's aggressive artificial intelligence investments and the launch of its own satellite network. These businesses are also less tied to the overall retail environment than Walmart's ancillary businesses such as advertising, making them a better hedge against tariff chaos.Walmart's scale and execution give it a distinct edge over other traditional retailers in an environment of rising prices and worried consumers. But beating Amazon at its own game is still a ways off.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250517000550:0/
"Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains? ",1747162800000,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and SoundHound AI, Inc . SOUN have made significant inroads in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, boosting their stock prices over the last year. Both are targeting distinct AI segments, so let’s determine the one with greater gains. The Bullish Case for SOUN Stock The temporary trade agreement between the United States and China is good news for SoundHound AI stock. Tariffs on Chinese imports are lowered to 30% from 145%, and China has reduced the import duty on American commodities to 10% from 125%. The 90-day truce benefited companies with trade in the United States and China. Thanks to the deal with Tencent, SoundHound AI now operates in China. Tencent will integrate SoundHound’s voice AI into its cloud solutions for the automotive sector. As a software company, SoundHound AI may not be directly affected by tariffs; however, its cost of doing business rises significantly. Moreover, if tensions escalate, SoundHound AI may be blacklisted by China, impacting its partnership with Tencent. As more enterprise customers use SoundHound AI’s platforms, the company’s first-quarter 2025 revenues jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss in the first quarter narrowed by 14%. The company finished the quarter with positive cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. For full-year 2025, the company aims for 85% to 90% revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA. The Bullish Case for NVDA Stock NVIDIA is poised to gain from the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL. These cloud computing companies are acquiring NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to boost computing power for AI workloads. Alphabet, in particular, said that growth from its AI products in the latest reported quarter was much higher than that of Google Cloud. By 2028, NVIDIA forecasts AI data center spending to hit $1 trillion, fueling stock growth. NVIDIA’s advanced chips are also in high demand, with shipments of its latest cutting-edge new-generation Blackwell chips surging by the day due to their faster AI interface and improved energy efficiency. Additionally, the popularity of the CUDA software platform has increased among developers and is expected to improve NVIDIA’s quarterly performance (read more: Can Palantir Stock be the Next NVIDIA, and Is It Worth Buying?). NVIDIA or SoundHound AI: Which Stock Has Greater Gain Potential? No doubt, the latest trade deal and widespread adoption of SoundHound’s voice-enabled AI systems are positives for the stock. However, the company is simply growing through acquisitions and less organically. If diverse corporate cultures don’t seamlessly blend, then it can be a hindrance to SoundHound AI’s growth story. SoundHound AI isn’t profitable yet and has often failed to meet its guidance, impacting the stock’s growth. Despite issuing positive EBITDA guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company’s adjusted EBITDA remained a negative $22.2 million five quarters later. On the other hand, NVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than the Semiconductor - General industry, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, higher than the industry’s 49.5%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has more room to scale upward. Furthermore, SoundHound AI lacks a competitive edge like NVIDIA has with GPUs. NVIDIA’s more than 80% market share in the GPU space will help the stock sustain market volatility, which could pose challenges for SoundHound AI. This indicates, NVIDIA can offer better and consistent gains in the near future. For now, both NVIDIA and SoundHound AI have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Taking Stock of the Earnings Picture ,1748040480000,"The earnings release from Nvidia NVDA is the true highlight of this week’s earnings docket, though there are a few other bellwethers on deck to report results as well, including Costco COST, Salesforce.com CRM, and Ulta Beauty ULTA. We have close to 100 companies reporting results this week, including 14 S&P 500 members.It is no exaggeration to say that Nvidia has emerged as a leader of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, with its chips running the models. The stock has struggled this year, as sentiment on the AI space soured in the aftermath of the DeepSeek announcement in January. There had already been some angst in the market about the ever-rising AI-focused spending by Mag 7 players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, with the issue becoming front and center following the DeepSeek announcement.The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of Nvidia shares relative to the S&P 500 index and the Mag 7 group.Nvidia is expected to bring in 85 cents in EPS on $42.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +39.3% and +63.7%, respectively. Estimates have been under pressure, with the current 85 cents estimate down from 87 cents a week ago and 93 cents two months back.A big contributing factor to the pressure on estimates has been worries among analysts that Nvidia’s near-term margins may face some squeeze as it transitions to the new Blackwell GPU from the Hopper unit. There had been some concern over the last couple of quarters about Nvidia’s ability to ramp up Blackwell production efficiently, but all indications are that the ramp-up is proceeding smoothly and the demand for the unit is significantly above what had been experienced in the comparable period the year before for Hopper.Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, noted at a recent industry conference that Blackwell demand from the four largest hyperscalers was running three times as much as was the case from the same customers for Hopper at the comparable period in 2024. The company has outlined a Blackwell Ultra version to follow the full Blackwell ramp-up.While hyperscaler demand over the near-to-medium-term is expected to remain robust, it will eventually taper off. But the recent announcements of major datacenter deals with sovereign wealth funds in the UAE and Saudi Arabia suggest that Nvidia likely has a big runway ahead of it.In terms of valuation, Nvidia shares aren’t cheap, but they are hardly the nose-bleed valuation of a couple of years back, as the chart below shows.With Nvidia as the only Mag 7 member that has yet to report Q1 results, earnings for the group are on track to +27.2% from the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.

"The Score: UnitedHealth, Walmart, Coinbase Global and More Stocks That Moved on the Week's News — WSJ",1747430220000,"By Francesca FontanaThe Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them.UnitedHealthUnitedHealth suffered a stock meltdown this past week.The Justice Department is investigating the healthcare conglomerate — and parent of insurance giant UnitedHealthcare — for possible criminal Medicare fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.The criminal probe adds to a list of government inquiries into UnitedHealth, including antitrust investigations and a civil investigation of its Medicare billing practices that The Wall Street Journal first reported in February.UnitedHealth said it hadn't been notified by the Justice Department of the criminal investigation and stands by the integrity of its Medicare Advantage program. A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.Earlier in the week, UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 earnings financial outlook, and announced the sudden resignation of Chief Executive Andrew Witty. Witty stepped down for ""personal reasons,"" replaced by Chairman and former CEO Stephen Hemsley.UnitedHealth shares sank 18% Tuesday, and on Thursday fell 11%.Amazon.comTo the surprise of investors and businesses around the world, the U.S. and China made a deal on trade.The two countries agreed to a 90-day trade deal that slashed tariffs between the two countries and sent stocks surging — including the biggest U.S. tech stocks whose operations depend on China.Online retail giant Amazon, for one, sells many Chinese-made products. Many of Amazon's third-party sellers source their products from the country, and independent merchants warned that prices could skyrocket if tariffs continued. Some had said their businesses would cease operations.Amazon shares gained 8.1% Monday.BoeingBoeing shares gained some air on the surprise trade truce between the U.S. and China.As part of the deal to temporarily roll back tariffs, China scrapped an earlier ban on Boeing's airplanes. Beijing told Chinese airlines that they can resume taking delivery on pre-existing jet orders.The government last month told Chinese carriers they had to seek additional approval before taking delivery of Boeing aircraft they had already ordered, in effect halting deliveries to one of Boeing's biggest markets.The U.S. jet maker also benefited from the recent trade deal struck between the U.S. and the U.K., with British Airways purchasing 32 Boeing aircraft.Boeing shares gained 2.5% Tuesday.Foot LockerDick's Sporting Goods is taking over Foot Locker.In a deal announced Thursday morning, big-box retailer Dick's agreed to buy the sneaker company for roughly $2.4 billion.Dick's said it expects to operate Foot Locker as a stand-alone business unit within its portfolio and maintain the Foot Locker brands.Foot Locker's shares had slumped this year on Trump's tariff plans, which upended supply chains and costs for retailers and sneaker companies.The deal follows the recent sneaker buyout of Skechers, which agreed to sell itself for $9.4 billion to private-equity firm 3G Capital.Foot Locker shares soared 86% Thursday, while Dick's shares dropped 15%.WalmartTariff-related price hikes are coming to Walmart.While its quarterly sales were strong, the U.S. retail behemoth said that it plans to raise prices this month and early this summer. Tariffs have already driven up the prices of some of Walmart's goods — such as bananas at 54 cents a pound, up from 50 cents, according to Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey.Many companies have already announced price increases, and other retailers are likely to follow suit. Later this month, Target, Lowe's and Home Depot will report earnings and discuss their financial forecasts.Walmart didn't share a profit forecast for the current quarter, in part because the company may absorb some tariff costs to keep prices lower than competitors, Rainey said.Walmart shares dipped 0.5% Thursday.Coinbase GlobalThe largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange said it refused to pay a $20 million ransom demand from cybercriminals that stole sensitive customer data.Coinbase said the criminals bribed the company's overseas customer support agents to steal the data, which includes names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.In a regulatory filing, the company estimated that the incident could cost from $180 million to $400 million.The breach is a setback for Coinbase — which is slated to join the S&P 500 later this month — and threatens its cultivated reputation for safety. The company has largely avoided the hacks and heists suffered by many exchanges overseas.Coinbase shares fell 7.2% Thursday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

"FedEx strikes new Amazon deal, says heavy and rural deliveries are money makers",1747159920000,"By Tomi KilgoreFedEx's new deal comes nearly six years after its express business dropped Amazon, and about four months since archrival UPS cut its Amazon business in halfFedEx Corp. said that, following about a year of talks, it has a new delivery deal with Amazon.com Inc., which comes some five years after the two companies pared their delivery partnership.The deal also comes nearly four months after FedEx (FDX) rival United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said it was cutting its business with Amazon (AMZN) by more than half, because it wasn't profitable.FedEx assured investors that the business would make money, especially since the deliveries would be of the higher-margin variety - big and bulky, and to less populated places.""We would not go back to and open a deal after walking away five years ago if it did not make financial sense,"" said Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere, according to a FactSet transcript from a BofA Securities conference.FedEx did not provide details on how much the new deal would be worth. But when asked by BofA Securities analyst Ken Hoexter if the $5 billion in revenue UPS forfeited by cutting its Amazon business would instead go to FedEx, Carere said, ""It's not that, I am sure.""When Hoexter pressed as to the size of the contract, Carere just said: ""This will not be our largest customer. Period.""FedEx's stock slipped 0.3% in afternoon trading, while UPS shares shed 1.7% and Amazon's stock climbed 1.8%.The FedEx deal is not built on the notion of supplanting UPS, as Amazon noted that UPS remains a delivery partner. And more than two-thirds of Amazon's packages are now delivered in the U.S. via the company's own distribution network.""FedEx joins [Amazon's] other third-party partners, like UPS and the [U.S. Postal Service], that work alongside our own last-mile delivery network to help us balance capacity to best serve customers,"" Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement provided to MarketWatch.FedEx said in mid-2019 that it had decided not to renew its FedEx Express U.S. domestic delivery contract with Amazon, given poor returns from the deal.It's different this time, Carere said, because the deal is for ""heavy, hard-to-handle packages"" that she said FedEx can manage better than its competitors, and for rural areas, which can be valuable to FedEx if priced right.She also took a shot at rivals that have dropped rural deliveries. ""Business that is more difficult to move is where we get more value,"" Carere said. ""I really don't understand our primary competitors' need to pull back from rural. We've actually [won] business - [and] very profitable business - as a result.""FedEx's stock has dropped 17.5% in 2025, and UPS shares have shed 21.1%, while the S&P 500 index SPX has gained 0.3%.Read on: As the Dow and S&P claw back their 2025 losses, they're setting up for an extremely rare comeback victory-Tomi KilgoreThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Humain Partners with U.S. Tech Companies to Build AI Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia — Update,1747156260000,"By Adriano Marchese and Connor HartHumain, the arm of Saudi Arabia's public investment fund focused on artificial intelligence, will partner with several U.S. tech companies to build out AI infrastructure in the country.The AI value-chain subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on Monday said it has formed strategic partnerships with Nvidia, Amazon.com and Advanced Micro Devices. Under these three collaborations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expects more than $15 billion of investments to contribute to the deployment of hundreds of megawatts of AI compute capacity over the coming years.Humain earlier in the day disclosed its partnership with chipmaking giant Nvidia, under which it planned to build AI factories in the country with a projected capacity of up to 500 megawatts, powered by hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's GPUs.The first phase of deployment would involve about 18,000 of Nvidia's supercomputers, the parties said.Later, in a separate release, Humain said it would work with Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, to invest more than $5 billion and build what it called an AI Zone. This zone is set to combine multiple AI capabilities and will allow Humain to develop AI solutions using AWS technologies for its end customers, it added.Amazon's recent investment follows a previously announced, separate $5.3 billion investment to build an AWS infrastructure region in Saudi Arabia that is set to become available next year.Humain will additionally partner with Advanced Micro Devices to build a network of AMD-based AI computing centers stretching from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. The parties will invest up to $10 billion to deploy 500 megawatts of AI computing capacity over the next five years.The AI superstructure built by AMD and Humain will be open by design, accessible at scale and optimized to power AI workloads across enterprise, start-up and sovereign markets, they said.Investors rallied behind the investments.

It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Container ship owners swamped as US-China trade detente revives demand,1747424049000,"Container ship bookings for China-to-U.S. cargo have surged since the countries declared a 90-day truce on punitive tit-for-tat tariffs last weekend, operators said, spawning traffic jams at Chinese ports and factories that could take weeks to clear.U.S. importers of sneakers and sofas to construction supplies and auto parts are racing to get goods in before the deadline resets tariffs again, setting the stage for disruptions that recall the global transport quagmire during the COVID-19 pandemic.The cargo surge at major trade gateways like Shenzhen's Yantian Port, which handles more than a quarter of China's exports to the United States, has ship owners scrambling to coordinate berths and adjust vessel schedules.""The demand is so high that we can only serve customers who have made long-term contracts with us,"" a spokesperson for German container ship operator Hapag-Lloyd XETR:HLAG told Reuters. ""We have hardly enough space for spontaneous bookings."" Container-tracking software provider Vizion said average bookings for the seven days ended on Wednesday soared 277% to 21,530 20-foot equivalent units from the 5,709 TEU average for the week ended May 5.Owners of factories that make toys to holiday decor told Reuters they are booking previously frozen cargo headed to U.S. stores, including Walmart NYSE:WMT .Lalo, for example, which sells its baby furniture online and through retailers like Target NYSE:TGT and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , is among the companies that gave factories the green light to move their finished orders.""We had hundreds of thousands of units waiting to ship,"" said Lalo co-founder Michael Wieder. ""These products can now get on the water.""""Everybody is very busy from my company, at my friend's companies,"" said Richard Lee, CEO of NCL Logistics, in China's southern metropolis of Shenzhen. ""They are preparing a lot of cargo, a lot of products, to be shipped immediately from China to the U.S.""SECOND TSUNAMI?The shipping surge will translate into a rush of arrivals at U.S. West Coast ports in the coming weeks.Still, industry experts, including the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles - the busiest U.S. seaport and No. 1 for ocean shipments from China, do not foresee a COVID-level tsunami of cargo. Rather, they project a large, but manageable wave.On Thursday, the off-contract spot rate from Shanghai to Los Angeles shot up 16% from the prior week to $3,136 per 40-foot container, according to data from maritime consultancy Drewry. That is less than half than in April 2024, but could jump sharply on June 1 to about $6,000 per container if ship owners push through rate increases.In the early days of the pandemic, as now, cargo demand spikes overwhelmed factories and container ships, kinking supply chains. Shipping and retail experts said 90 days is not enough time for most factories to fill new orders. Fewer slots are available on cargo ships because vessel owners had been culling China-to-U.S. voyages and schedules. Now, ocean carriers are ""cancelling cancellations"" of sailings, Drewry said.Demand, however, is markedly different this time.Trump's second-term tariffs have weakened U.S. retail sales, homebuilding and manufacturing - key drivers of container shipments.Moreover, many U.S. companies are sitting on inventory accumulated before Trump imposed tariffs on China and other countries. And nobody knows what import duties will be when the 90-day deadline expires in August.The Trump administration confirmed to Reuters that the U.S. rate would reset to 54%, assuming no agreement is reached by the deadline.HIGH ANXIETYMany retailers are prioritizing which products to order and ship, said Jessica Dankert, vice president of supply chain for the Retail Industry Leaders Association trade group, whose members include Home Depot NYSE:HD , Gap NYSE:GAP and Dollar General NYSE:DG .""It's still 30% at the end of the day,"" said Jamie Salter, CEO of Authentic Brands Group, referring to tariffs on China. Authentic Brands owns and licenses clothing brands including Reebok, Champion, and Forever 21.Some large suppliers to Detroit's Big Three automakers told Reuters that on customers' requests, they are flying in parts from China and stockpiling them.Others declined to add to inventories, saying they lacked the space and funds to do so.A Halloween goods exporter from the city of Yiwu in China, who gave her English name, Cecilia, said tariff increases have cut total orders in half this year and warned that prospective buyers are running out of time.""If you order now, you will have an anxious wait to see if it will be too late,"" she said.Jimmy Zollo, CEO at Joe and Bella, sells Chinese-made clothing for adults who have trouble dressing themselves due to arthritis, dementia or being in a wheelchair. He placed a new order with his supplier even though the 90-day window could close before he can take delivery.""We're hopeful that a new trade agreement is implemented, and the lowered tariffs do not expire,"" Zollo said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RN18D:0-container-ship-owners-swamped-as-us-china-trade-detente-revives-demand/"

White House Says It Gets More Than $200 Billion in Deals With United Arab Emirates,1747414260000,"By Kelly CloonanThe White House said it received more than $200 billion in commitments on deals with the United Arab Emirates, including a $14.5 billion order from Etihad Airways and agreements on artificial intelligence.The latest deals join a slew of technology, aircraft and defense-related agreements announced in recent days as President Trump finishes out his four-day tour of the Middle East. The deals bring the total investment agreements in the Middle East to more than $2 trillion, the White House said.As part of the latest agreements, Boeing and GE Aerospace will deliver 28 American-made Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines for Etihad Airways. The partnership will support 60,000 U.S. jobs, the White House said.The order adds to a growing backlog for the two companies, which received a $96 billion order from Qatar Airways on Wednesday after Trump's visit to Qatar.The latest deals also aim to boost American energy companies, with a partnership between Exxon Mobil, Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. for expanded oil and natural gas production valued at $60 billion.

C3.ai vs. UiPath: Which AI Automation Stock Is the Better Buy in 2025?,1747154160000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI and UiPath Inc . PATH are both high-profile players in the booming AI automation sector. C3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications, including predictive maintenance and generative AI tools, while UiPath leads in robotic process automation and is evolving toward “agentic AI” solutions. Both companies have seen recent momentum amid the broader artificial intelligence hype. In 2025, each presents a distinct case: C3.ai is smaller but growing faster, whereas UiPath is larger with more stable financials.These companies stand at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing trends—AI and digital transformation—making them compelling candidates for investors eyeing long-term technology disruption. Recent volatility in both stocks, coupled with evolving enterprise spending patterns and new product developments, has reignited interest in evaluating their investment potential. With macroeconomic uncertainty pressuring tech valuations and AI narratives driving short-term sentiment, now is an opportune time to assess which stock holds more promise.Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is the better investment at present.The Case for C3.ai StockC3.ai markets itself as an enterprise AI pure play, offering a suite of prebuilt, configurable AI applications that help large organizations implement predictive analytics, detect anomalies, and optimize operations. In theory, this makes its platform highly scalable across sectors. C3.ai has positioned itself as a pure-play enterprise AI software company, offering a broad portfolio of over 100 pre-built AI applications across various industries, including energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Central to the company’s growth strategy is its deepening alignment with major cloud providers and government institutions, designed to accelerate go-to-market efforts and extend distribution scale.C3.ai’s strengths center on its leadership in enterprise AI. The company claims first-mover status in “model-driven” AI applications, having expanded across numerous industries (19 in total) and the U.S. federal government, where federal revenues grew more than 100% in fiscal 2024. The company has secured large customers and pilots — recent announced deals include ExxonMobil XOM, the U.S. Navy, Shell, BASF, and multiple state/local governments. Strategic partnerships bolster C3.ai’s reach. For example, C3.ai is the most sought-after AI application on Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure cloud marketplace. It has a tie-up with Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud and Amazon ’s AMZN Amazon Web Services. Since announcing an expanded alliance with Microsoft in late 2024, C3.ai closed 28 new deals through joint engagements, spanning nine industries. Sales cycles with Microsoft have shortened by approximately 20%, a testament to the strength of their joint go-to-market motions. As of the fiscal third-quarter end, C3.ai and Microsoft were engaged in more than 600 active enterprise opportunities globally. These factors suggest that there will be continued opportunities as companies seek AI tools to streamline processes and decision-making.In its fiscal third-quarter results, C3.ai reported total revenues of $98.8 million, marking a 26% increase year over year. Subscription revenues grew 22% year over year to $85.7 million, constituting 87% of total revenues. The company closed 66 agreements, including 50 pilots, a 72% increase year over year.C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non GAAP loss of 12 cents per share). The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.Although cash reserves are large ($724.3 million at the fiscal third-quarter end), continued losses raise the risk of dilution or spending pressure. Competition is fierce – from other AI startups to tech giants building in-house AI solutions, which could pressure C3.ai’s growth or pricing. Growth also appears to be moderating after a surge in activity. Revenue growth rate decreased from 29% in the fiscal second quarter to 26% in the fiscal third quarter.The Case for UiPath StockUiPath operates in the adjacent, yet distinct, space of robotic process automation. Its platform automates rule-based, repetitive digital tasks—freeing up human workers and reducing costs for businesses. In contrast to C3.ai’s focus on predictive analytics and machine learning, UiPath emphasizes process optimization, task mining, and digital workflow orchestration. This has enabled it to gain broad adoption across banking, insurance, healthcare, and public sector clients. UiPath’s strengths lie in its market leadership and innovation. UiPath has a large global customer base and high retention (net retention approximately 110–115%), meaning existing accounts keep expanding. Management notes that 90% of surveyed enterprises see opportunities for agentic AI in their workflows, suggesting a large addressable market ahead. Furthermore, UiPath enjoys very high gross margins (85% non-GAAP in the fiscal fourth quarter) and has been streamlining its cost structure, supporting improved profitability.UiPath’s business and financial profile contrast sharply with C3.ai’s. UiPath is much larger and has recently been moving toward profitability. In fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31, 2025), UiPath reported revenues of $1.43 billion, up 9% year over year. In the fiscal fourth quarter (October 2024–January 2025), revenues were $424 million (up 5%). Its subscription and recurring model yields stable bookings — year-end Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $1.666 billion (up 14%). Crucially, UiPath generated a GAAP operating profit of $34 million in the fiscal fourth quarter (versus a year-ago loss) and $241 million of non-GAAP operating income for the full year. Free cash flow was robust, reaching $328 million in fiscal 2025. The company ended the year with about $1.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet and launched a $500 million share buyback program, announced during the fiscal second quarter. These figures point to a healthy, cash-generative model, despite modest growth.On the other hand, UiPath faces challenges. Its revenue growth rate has slowed to mid-single digits (10% in the fiscal second quarter, 9% in the fiscal third quarter, 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter) as large enterprises moderate spending. Global economic uncertainty — especially in the U.S. public sector — has pressured guidance. Competition is fierce: Microsoft (Power Automate), Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and even open-source tools vie for the automation market. UiPath remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis for the year (fiscal 2025 GAAP operating loss was $163 million), though it expects to sustain profitability going forward.Share Price Performance & Valuations for C3.ai, UiPath StocksPATH (up 3%) has performed better than AI (down 29.7%) so far in 2025. Over the past month, PATH has gained 22.2%, more than AI’s 20.6% rally.Share Price PerformanceValuationC3.ai is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7X, below its three-year median of 8.33X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 5.74X. PATH’s forward earnings multiple sits at 4.63X, below its three-year median of 6.41X. The C3.ai stock appears expensive when compared with the sector average and PATH.While both companies operate in the AI automation space, UiPath's valuation metrics suggest a more balanced investment profile, with expectations of future profitability and valuations in line with industry norms. C3.ai carries a higher valuation premium and lacks current profitability, which may present greater investment risk.Comparing EPS Projections: C3.ai & UiPathThe 2025 EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days for PATH stock while the same remained unchanged for C3.ai. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C3.ai’s 2025 bottom line suggests a 4.3% improvement, while that for PATH indicates a year-over-year decline of 1.9%.For C3.ai StockFor UiPath StockConclusionBoth C3.ai and UiPath are positioned to benefit from the continued interest in AI-driven automation, but their risk/reward profiles differ. C3.ai offers higher growth potential, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicating 29.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, and first-mover advantages in the enterprise AI market. However, it is still unprofitable, burning cash. In contrast, UiPath is larger and almost cash-flow positive. It generates profits on a non-GAAP basis, boasts a strong balance sheet, and recently returned capital via a $500 million buyback.In a nutshell, C3.ai’s upside depends on sustaining rapid growth and successfully scaling new AI offerings, which is far from certain, given competition and macro risks. UiPath, while growing more slowly, has a more proven business model and valuation that is easier to justify. UiPath — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company - appears to offer better upside potential in 2025. Its combination of profitability, strong cash flow, and reasonable valuation makes it more resilient if growth disappoints. C3.ai — a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company — could outperform on strong AI tailwinds, but it is riskier and richly priced.

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold INOD Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747411920000,"Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company’s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata’s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues — highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company’s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% — demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology — each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management’s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD’s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts’ bearish sentiments about the stock. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Magnitude - Consensus Estimate TrendINOD’s Valuation Looks StretchedInnodata's current valuation seems stretched, as evidenced by its one-year forward price-to-sales ratio of 4.31 — well above the Zacks Computer – Services industry average of 1.76. This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company’s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere’s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata. With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit. While long-term prospects look strong amid rising AI spending from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, near-term risks tied to customer concentration, execution and margin pressure remain.Given the southward revision of earnings estimates and the current valuation suggesting caution for new entrants, existing shareholders should consider holding, and new investors may wait for further validation of revenue diversification and pipeline conversion before adding to positions.INOD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Is META Stock's 24.18X PE Still Worth it? Buy, Sell, or Hold?",1747153140000,"Meta Platforms META shares are trading at a premium as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E), META is trading at 24.18X, a premium compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 23.72X. Meta Platforms shares are trading at a premium compared to its closest peer in the digital advertising domain, Alphabet GOOGL, but at a discount compared with Amazon AMZN. In terms of the forward 12-month P/E, Alphabet shares are trading at 16.26X, while Amazon is trading at 31.44X. Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to absorb roughly 50% of the projected global ad spending by 2028.P/E Ratio (F12M)Although higher tariffs and a prolonged trade war have the potential to hurt digital advertising spending, negatively impacting prospects, we believe Meta Platforms’ AI focus is a key catalyst. Meta Platforms’ focus on leveraging AI to improve user engagement is noteworthy. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement. Amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Meta Platforms shares have appreciated 9.2% year to date, outperforming the broader sector as well as peers, including Alphabet and Amazon, shares of which have dropped 4.9% and 16.3%, respectively.META Stock’s PerformanceMETA shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.META Shares Trade Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs  META Leverages AI to Boost Advertising RevenuesMeta Platforms focuses on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA NVDA. The deployment of META’s deep neural network on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip across Instagram and Facebook applications has achieved more than 6% recall improvement to the retrieval system while delivering over 8% ad quality improvement on selected segments. Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that was used on Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months. META’s growing focus on social commerce through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is noteworthy. In first-quarter 2025, WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions contributed to deliver 34% year-over-year growth in Family of Apps other revenues, reaching $510 million.META’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward MovementThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.84 per share, up by 3.2% over the past 30 days, indicating a 13.18% year-over-year increase.META’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.30%. Meta Platforms, Inc.

For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by its Gen AI initiatives and core business. Although these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe the lack of monetization of new platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. The company doesn’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025.

BigBear.ai Stock 65% Below Its 52-Week High: Buy the Dip or Stay Away?,1747405620000,"BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI stock has had a rough ride in 2025, declining 18.2% year to date, underperforming both the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, which is down 5.2%, and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector, which has dipped 1.3%. As a result, BBAI now trades nearly 65% below its 52-week high of $10.36 and hovers close to its 52-week low of $1.17.BBAI YTD Share Price PerformanceAs a focused artificial intelligence (AI) company, BigBear.ai offers decision intelligence solutions that aim to help organizations make more informed, data-driven decisions. Despite the long-term promise of AI and continued enterprise investment in the space, BBAI faces near-term headwinds. Market volatility in early 2025 has weighed heavily on speculative tech names, especially those still operating at a loss.In its recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, BigBear.ai posted revenues of $34.8 million, marking a 5% increase from a year ago, but missing analyst expectations by 3.2%. The company recorded an adjusted loss of 10 cents per share, which was wider than the consensus estimate of a 6-cent loss per share. Adjusted EBITDA also deteriorated, falling to a loss of $7 million from a $1.6 million loss last year. This was largely driven by increased R&D spending and ongoing SG&A expenses amid government funding delays. On a GAAP basis, the net loss narrowed significantly to $62 million from $127.8 million a year earlier, though the figure remained impacted by non-cash charges such as derivative losses and stock-based compensation.As investors weigh on the company’s potential in the AI space against its financial losses and operational uncertainties, the key question remains: Is this recent weakness a buying opportunity, or does more downside risk lie ahead for BigBear.ai?What’s Hurting BigBear.ai Stock’s Performance?Profitability Pressured by Delays & Increased Investment : Despite its positioning, BigBear.ai continues to face meaningful headwinds. Revenue remains ""lumpy,"" driven by the timing of government contracts and milestone achievements. The company acknowledged procurement and funding delays due to shifts in federal efficiency mandates—an issue that may persist through the mid-year.Furthermore, increased R&D expenses, which jumped $3 million year over year in the first quarter, and elevated SG&A from underutilized capacity weighed on margins and operating performance. Recurring SG&A rose to $17.7 million from $13.6 million, partly due to the full-quarter impact of the Pangiam acquisition and continued spending to support unutilized resources caused by government funding delays. Adjusted gross margin declined slightly to 28.6%, and EBITDA losses widened, indicating near-term scalability challenges.Another ongoing concern is the high degree of non-cash financial activity, including $2.6 million in debt extinguishment losses and growing stock-based compensation, which affects bottom-line optics.Persistent Challenges in Cost Control and Revenue Recognition Timing : Several structural challenges persist. Elevated operating expenses, especially from hiring and system integration, are weighing heavily on margins. The company cited delays in government funding as a reason for excess staffing costs and underutilized capacity, a scenario that may repeat if fiscal uncertainties continue.Moreover, a $33 million increase in the fair value of derivative liabilities, primarily due to warrant revaluations and note conversions, contributed to increased volatility in reported results. While these are non-cash items, they significantly impact bottom-line perception and investor sentiment.The lack of visibility around contract timing and the company’s exposure to federal budget cycles remain material risks, particularly given BigBear.ai’s heavy reliance on public sector clients.Can the BigBear.ai Stock Stage a Comeback?Strategic Contracts and AI Expansion : A cornerstone of BigBear.ai’s first-quarter traction was the award of a significant contract to deliver and maintain the Department of Defense Joint Staff J35’s Orion Decision Support Platform. This contract is notable not just for its size but also for its strategic relevance, as it affirms BigBear’s capability to meet high-level defense analytics and decision-making needs.Additionally, the company deepened relationships in sectors such as shipbuilding and logistics, with expanded work for clients like Austal USA. These engagements showcase how BigBear is leveraging its analytics suite to improve operational efficiency and supply chain visibility in strategically vital industries. Such wins are a testament to the company’s dual strengths — technical AI sophistication and domain-specific expertise.Internationally, partnerships such as the one with Smith Detection on prohibited item detection are helping the company penetrate global security markets.BigBear.ai is steadily expanding its footprint through strategic alliances with leading technology firms, reinforcing the credibility and utility of its AI-driven solutions. Major players like Amazon AMZN, Palantir PLTR, and Autodesk ADSK have integrated BigBear.ai’s technologies into their ecosystems, showcasing growing enterprise adoption.Amazon Web Services (AWS) has embedded BigBear.ai’s ProModel solution into AWS ProServe, leveraging its predictive modeling and real-time analytics to optimize logistics and warehouse operations. In the defense and intelligence space, Palantir has teamed up with BigBear.ai to strengthen its AI capabilities, underscoring the relevance of BBAI’s solutions in high-stakes environments. Additionally, Autodesk is utilizing BigBear.ai’s technology to enhance its design and engineering platforms, highlighting applications in industrial automation and complex system simulation.This momentum aligns with the company’s dual-pronged 2025 strategy—fortifying its core U.S. defense and government tech markets while branching out into commercial and international verticals. CEO Kevin McAleenan emphasized a mission-driven innovation model that blends advanced AI with operational understanding, giving the company an edge in domains like border security and supply chain intelligence.Innovation-Focused Product Portfolio Gains Traction : The company’s broad and expanding portfolio of AI products also served as a key driver. Platforms like Pangiam Threat Detection, ProModel AI, ConductorOS, and Shipyard.ai are designed to solve complex logistics, analytics, and decision-making challenges across both government and commercial sectors. Some of these products, particularly veriScan and Trueface, contributed directly to revenue gains this quarter.Importantly, several R&D projects have now transitioned into general availability, which could enhance monetization and adoption rates going forward. This shift from pure R&D to deployable solutions underscores BigBear.ai’s ability to commercialize innovation and move up the technology maturity curve.Estimates Show Bearish Trend for BBAI StockThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share is pegged at 41 cents, which has widened from 21 cents in the past 30 days. Yet, the estimated figure indicates a narrower loss from a loss of $1.10 per share a year ago.BBAI Stock’s ValuationIn terms of the forward 12-month price/sales (P/S), BBAI is trading at 6.07X, higher than its three-year median of 1.90X but lower than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.17X. BBAI currently has a Value Score of F.How to Play BBAI Stock Now?Despite BigBear.ai's promising strategic alliances and expanding AI product portfolio, the near-term outlook remains challenged by weak financial performance, lack of profitability, and structural risks. The company’s wider-than-expected first-quarter losses, deteriorating EBITDA, and contracting gross margins point to scalability issues amid persistent delays in government funding. Operational inefficiencies, including elevated SG&A and underutilized capacity, have significantly pressured margins, while non-cash derivative losses and stock-based compensation further distort true profitability.With revenue growth falling short and cost controls still elusive, the path to sustainable earnings remains uncertain. The stock’s 65% plunge from its 52-week high, combined with a bearish shift in 2025 earnings estimates, suggests sentiment may worsen before stabilizing.

How Should You Play Nebius Stock Going Into Q1 Earnings?,1747402560000,"Nebius Group N.V . NBIS will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 20, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 45 cents. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past seven days but has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $63.8 million.Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company. Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS’ Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS’ Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will ‍boast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. These behemoths already have a global-scale AI cloud, whereas NBIS is still expanding its infrastructure. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market.NBIS Stock PerformanceNebius shares have lost 19.5% over the past three months, underscoring broader and company-specific challenges. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector decline of 5.1% and the Zacks Internet Software Services industry’s gain of 4.3%.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its peers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 11.3% and 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame, while Microsoft has gained 10.7%.NBIS' ValuationIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 2.59X, lower than the Internet Software Services industry’s ratio of 4.12, but it could mean more risk than opportunity.Investment Thesis for NBIS StockGiven Nebius' ongoing investments in its core AI infrastructure platform and promising growth in Toloka and Avride platforms, long-term potential remains. However, significant margin pressure owing to ongoing investments and fierce competition from behemoths clouds the outlook. The negative Earnings ESP and muted stock performance further temper expectations. Retaining NBIS stock ahead of earnings appears prudent, but cautious optimism is warranted.What to Do With NBIS Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds in the AI space, it is an exciting growth story, but one with competitive pressures that investors must closely monitor.NBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:fdddaf27b094b:0-how-should-you-play-nebius-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/

Should You Hold or Sell The Trade Desk Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747149900000,"The Trade Desk ( TTD) shares have plunged 32.5% year to date. Though the company’s better-than-expected first quarter results offered some respite, with shares jumping 32.6% since May 8. Revenues were up 25%, implying strong demand trends. On the other hand, heightened macro uncertainty is expected to squeeze ad budgets, which does not bode well for TTD.So now the question is, should investors think of buying TTD stock at the moment? Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.TTD’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotTTD reported revenues of $616 million, up 25% year over year and surpassing management’s revenue guidance of at least $575 million. Adjusted EBITDA stood at $208 million (34% margin) compared with $162 million (33% margin) in the year-ago quarter. Video, which includes connected TV or CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of digital spend, while mobile had a mid-30 percent share. Display constituted a low double-digit share, and audio represented around 5%. Customer retention stood at over 95% for the quarter reported.TTD reported net cash provided by operating activities of $291.4 million, and free cash flow was $230 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 33 cents, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. The Trade Desk Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Trade Desk price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Trade Desk QuoteThe company also noted that its Kokai platform was now being used by two-thirds of the clients, much ahead of schedule. The platform is now delivering on lower funnel KPIs, including 24% lower cost per conversion and 20% lower cost per acquisition, added TTD. 100% adoption by clients is expected to be completed by the year-end. The integration of Koa AI tools was highlighted by management as a “game changer” for the Kokai platform.TTD also completed the acquisition of Sincera, a leading digital advertising data company. This buyout will help enhance its programmatic advertising platform by integrating Sincera’s actionable insights on data quality. Unified ID 2.0, the company’s flagship identity solution and an alternative to third-party cookies, is witnessing increasing adoption. For the second quarter of 2025, revenues are expected to be $682 million.Where is TTD Headed From Here?Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions do not augur well for TTD, as these could squeeze ad budgets. TTD highlighted the impact of the volatile macro backdrop, particularly on the large global brands. If macro headwinds worsen or persist into the second half of 2025, revenue growth may face further pressure due to reduced programmatic demand.The intensely competitive nature of the digital advertising industry, dominated by industry giants like Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN, as well as players like Magnite MGNI, continues to put pressure on TTD’s market positioning. Growing regulatory scrutiny around data privacy and evolving consumer data practices also threaten to disrupt the established audience-targeting methods.While CTV remains a strong revenue driver, the market is increasingly fragmented and competitive. Heavy reliance on CTV for growth is a concern, as any adverse impact on this segment could weigh heavily on the overall performance. Moreover, TTD derived 88% of its revenue from North America while only 12% came from international markets. A weak international footprint limits TTD’s total addressable market expansion potential.Increasing costs are likely to weigh on profitability. In the last reported quarter, total operating costs surged 21.4% year over year to $561.6 million. Expenses soared on account of continued investments in boosting platform capabilities, particularly platform operations. Higher costs can prove a drag on margins, especially if the revenue growth does not keep pace. Given all these factors, analysts remain bearish on the stock, as evident from the downward estimate revision in the past 30 days. TTD Stock Plunge Steeper than PeersTTD stock’s plunge of 32.5% YTD is steeper than the 13.7% decline of the Internet Services industry and the 1.3% decline of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its digital advertising peers, including Alphabet and Amazon and Magnite. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 16.3% and 4.9%, respectively, in the same time frame. Magnite has gained 1.3% YTD. Magnite is a supply-side platform that helps publishers manage and sell their ad inventory across various formats like streaming, online video, display and audio.Lofty Valuation for TTDFrom a valuation perspective, TTD is quite expensive. The stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 12.99X compared with the industry’s 4.75X.Investment Thesis for TTD StockDespite strong first-quarter results, The Trade Desk faces significant headwinds from macroeconomic uncertainty, rising costs, and fierce competition. Its heavy reliance on CTV and North America limits growth flexibility. Steep stock decline YTD, downward estimate revision activity and expensive valuation are other concerns. With a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), investors would be better off if they offloaded this stock from their portfolios. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e691e690d094b:0-should-you-hold-or-sell-the-trade-desk-stock-post-q1-earnings/

Ackman in 2022 built a new stake in Canadian Pacific, returning to one of his most profitable investments as rail firms eye a boost from the drive to cut carbon emissions and as manufacturing is brought back to the United States and Mexico from abroad.But in order to buy the Amazon stake, Ackman needed to make adjustments and came to liquidate Canadian Pacific.

"Weeks after Amazon's Alexa+ AI launch, a mystery: where are the users?",1747389600000,"Alexa, where are your users?More than six weeks after Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN began rolling out the new Alexa+ generative artificial-intelligence-powered voice assistant to hundreds of thousands of people, there is scant evidence it is in regular customers' hands.The new service was meant to be a triumph for Amazon after several delays in revamping Alexa in the age of AI chatbots like ChatGPT. The company signaled its significance by bringing CEO Andy Jassy to a February press event in New York where it showcased Alexa+’s capabilities and promised customers would start getting invite access in late March.“There seems to be no one who actually has it,” said Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponential, who attended the Alexa+ announcement event. “This fits a pattern of a lot of companies announcing services or products when they are awfully close to being ready, but not quite – that last mile is a lot farther away than they anticipated,” he said. In an ultimately unsuccessful effort to locate real-world users of Alexa+, Reuters searched dozens of news sites, YouTube, TikTok, X, BlueSky and Meta's Instagram and Facebook, as well as Amazon's Twitch and reviews of Echo voice-assistant devices on Amazon.com. Two who posted on Reddit claimed to have used the service, but did not provide Reuters with hard evidence and their identities could not be corroborated. ""Hundreds of thousands of customers now have access to Alexa+ — of course, some are employees and their families, but the overwhelming majority are customers that requested early access,” said an Amazon spokesperson. That is up from the approximately 100,000 users that Amazon reported on May 1.Amazon did not say why there were no verifiable public reviews or reactions to the new service and declined to make available for an interview any active Alexa+ users. The company does not require nondisclosure agreements in exchange for Alexa+ access, a spokesperson said.The rollout of Amazon AI-assisted Alexa+ is proceeding slowly and the service has struggled with speed in answering some questions or prompts, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. It also occasionally generates inaccurate or fabricated information, like other AI models, and is expensive to operate, the people said.Accessed mainly through Amazon televisions and Echo devices, Alexa can set timers, answer search queries and tell the weather if a user requests it out loud. While Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL Siri voice assistant preceded the original Alexa by three years, it was the Amazon service that supercharged the acceptance of voice assistants. The overhaul resulting in the generative AI-infused Alexa+ is meant to revitalize the decade-old service and help Amazon compete with chatbots from OpenAI, Meta NASDAQ:META and others. Amazon has plowed billions into developing Alexa since it was introduced in 2014, but it has been unprofitable and the vision of customers using it for voice-shopping never materialized.Technology companies typically rely on a mix of analysts, product reviewers, social media influencers and reporters to help get the word out about their newest devices or services. Apple, considered a master of marketing, gives launch-event attendees limited access to its iPhones or laptops for initial reviews, followed shortly by lengthier scrutiny within days or weeks of announcement. Amazon itself gave reviewers time to test out its new color Kindle device at an event in October before making it available to buy just two weeks later.In September 2023, Amazon showed off a prior iteration of the generative AI-infused Alexa and said customers would be getting an ""early preview"" of it within weeks. It never came. Alexa+ will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and even act as an “agent” on behalf of users by taking actions for them without their direct involvement. That contrasts with the current iteration, which generally handles only a single request at a time.During Amazon’s first-quarter earnings call two weeks ago, Jassy said more than 100,000 people were already using the new voice service and that “people are really liking Alexa+ thus far.”Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, said that by leaving a large gap between product launch and general availability, Amazon was failing to build anticipation for Alexa+. ""Just lean on your curated YouTube or TikTok advocates and tell them what to talk about,” he said. “Instead, this makes it look like they are worried about something.”Techsponential's Greengart said the February Alexa event could be seen as an early warning sign because attendees were not allowed to try the service themselves, instead being shuffled into breakout sessions where product managers ran through well-rehearsed routines and answered limited questions. Reuters, which attended the event, was also unable to try out the service.By contrast, at Amazon’s 2014 launch for its Fire Phone, users could hold the device and try its features. The original Echo device, running the Alexa service, became available weeks after its announcement in November 2014 and users went public with their reactions that December.The upgraded Alexa is designed to allow users to seek shopping advice such as vacation outfits and to receive aggregated news stories. As shown, it is meant to carry out more complicated requests, such as ordering food for delivery while also remembering a user’s dietary preferences.To demonstrate Alexa+'s broad use, Amazon pointed to an April TechRadar story that cited an anonymous Reddit post from a user claiming to have tested the service. The Reddit post has since been deleted.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0TK:0-weeks-after-amazon-s-alexa-ai-launch-a-mystery-where-are-the-users/"
"With UPS Out, Amazon Turns to FedEx — Barrons.com",1747144800000,"Al RootFedEx stock fell Tuesday after Amazon.com said it would be working with the logistics provider on last-mile delivery.FedEx shares were up in premarket trading, but gains faded, leaving them down 0.3% at $232.16.Despite the drop, BofA Securities analyst Ken Hoexter said the Amazon business will be ""accretive to yields and profitability."" He rates FedEx stock Buy and has a $270 price target on the shares.FedEx shares gained 6.9% in regular trading on Monday, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 3.3% and 2.8%, respectively. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China sent most shares higher, including shares of logistics providers. Shares of United Parcel Service added 5.6%, closing at $101.21. UPS was down 1.2% on Tuesday.Coming into the week, FedEx and UPS shares had fallen 21% and 28%, respectively, since the Nov. 5 election. President Donald Trump is an advocate for tariffs, and high tariffs aren't typically positive for shipping volumes.One reason UPS stock has underperformed FedEx is a fear that less Amazon.com business could pressure profit margins and earnings growth. In its fourth-quarter earnings update in January, UPS said it was shedding some business from the e-commerce company. Shares dropped 14% in response. Amazon amounted to more than 10% of UPS sales in 2024, but it is a less profitable business than average. The Amazon ""volume is not profitable for us, nor a healthy fit for our network,"" said CEO Carol Tomé on her company's second-quarter earnings conference call in April.Working with Amazon can be difficult. FedEx walked away from its Amazon business in 2019. Now it's back.""We've reached an agreement with FedEx to serve as one of several third-party partners to deliver packages to our customers,"" Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement.""FedEx has the global network, capacity, and expertise to serve the shipping needs of thousands of retailers in the e-commerce space,"" said FedEx in an emailed statement. ""We have reached a mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement to provide residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.""The new FedEx relationship isn't a replacement for UPS. Amazon utilizes several third-party logistics, including UPS, the U.S. Post Office, and, again, FedEx. However, Amazon delivers two-thirds of its own packages. In 2023, Amazon delivered some 5.9 billion packages in the U.S., according to Capital One Shopping Research.That's a lot of packages. The USPS delivered about 7 billion packages in 2023. FedEx Ground delivered closer to 3 billion packages in its fiscal year ended May 2024.It isn't unusual for retail and consumer goods organizations to internalize logistics as they grow. Walmart owns more than 12,000 semi-trucks, according to Transport Topics. PepsiCo owns almost 12,000.Earnings continued to grow after FedEx and Amazon split in 2019. FedEx earned about $12 a share in 2019. It's expected to earn north of $19 in 2025.Earnings growth has been tougher for UPS. It earned about $7.50 a share in 2019. It's expected to earn about $7 in 2025.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Away, an Original Internet Darling, Will Sell Its Luggage in More Places — WSJ",1747348200000,"By Katie DeightonAway, the luggage and travel brand that found its fame selling fashionable luggage directly to consumers online, has named new leadership and begun selling beyond its own website and branded stores as it tries to reach more consumers.Jen Rubio, a co-founder of Away and its chief executive officer since 2021, stepped down this week and assumed the role of executive chair. She was succeeded by Jessica Schinazi, a former executive at appliance-maker Dyson, fashion house LVMH and Amazon.com who had been president of Away since December.In a press release, Rubio described Schinazi as the right leader for Away because of her focus on operations. ""This transition is a natural next step for Away,"" said Rubio, who has built a luxury real-estate portfolio with her husband, Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield.This week, Away began selling some of its suitcases and bags on Amazon's U.S. website. It also announced that another selection will be available for purchase at Nordstrom locales and via the department store's website later this month. The brand made its first foray into wholesale with Dick's Sporting Goods last year.The moves are a departure for Away, which until recently had exclusively sold its luggage via its own channels. Founded in 2015, the company was part of a pack of direct-to-consumer startups that sidestepped traditional retailers and drew online shoppers with digital advertising, easy-to-navigate websites and stylish branding. Rubio and her co-founder, Steph Korey Goodwin, had both worked previously at direct-to-consumer eyewear brand Warby Parker.Like many later players from the direct-to-consumer boom, Away decided it would benefit from at least a limited presence in physical retail. Since 2016, it has opened 17 stand-alone stores primarily on the East and West coasts and in Texas, and plans to open more, targeting customers who want to see a $275 carry-on in real life before buying.Despite those physical stores, some shoppers outside those locations were ""saying, 'Hey, you're not in my city, and I really want to go and touch the products,'"" Schinazi said. Others wanted to shop at a department store to compare brands and collect loyalty points, she added. Deals with companies like Nordstrom, which carries competitor brands like Béis, Monos and Samsonite, ""feel like a really good way to meet the customers where they are in those locations right now,"" she said.As for Amazon, Away knew that potential customers were already searching for its name on the marketplace and winding up buying from companies that attached their products to the brand via search engine optimization practices.The company's Amazon storefront lists nine products, including its flagship suitcases. Nordstrom will carry a different selection, including Away's pricier aluminum suitcases and its softside luggage.Away also plans to use new sponsorship deals to help spread its brand further offline. On Thursday, the company announced its new title as the Official Luggage Partner of the WNBA's New York Liberty. That follows a December partnership with the F1 Academy, Formula One Group's female-only racing championship, which saw Scottish driver Logan Hannah take to a track in Abu Dhabi in an Away-branded livery and race suit.In 2019, Away said its sales had totaled $150 million in 2018, and the company was valued at $1.4 billion following a $100 million funding round. The pandemic, however, decimated sales, sending them into a tailspin of more than 90% and forcing the company to furlough or lay off the majority of its staff.Sales and staffing levels have since rebounded, though Away has still had to make head-count cuts, including a 25% reduction last year. Since 2020, it has employed a procession of chief marketing officers, including Selena Kalvaria, Melissa Weiss and Carla Dunham, who left in early 2024 after just over a year in the job.Marketing, including a February collaboration with the HBO resort drama ""White Lotus,"" is now overseen by Christine Gallagher, vice president of integrated marketing.The company declined to disclose recent sales figures.Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515014326:0/
US-China Talks Spark Optimism; Betting Markets See Recession Odds Drop,1747141200000,"US-China Trade Meeting Sparks Wall Street OptimismMonday, stocks soared on news that the red-hot, escalating trade war between the US and China had thawed as parties from each side announced that negotiators had made significant progress. Meanwhile, the world’s two largest economies issueda rare, joint statement. Both Chinese and US stocks like Tesla ( TSLA ), Alibaba ( BABA ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) applauded the news and gapped higher to start the week. Below are four reasons the long-term trend has changed and bulls are in control:Betting Markets Suggest that 2025 Recession Odds PlungeBetting markets like Polymarket exploded during the 2024 presidential election, with users betting on everything from politics to markets. While several legacy polls were inaccurate in their predictions, betting websites like Polymarket were accurate and correctly predicted that Donald Trump would win a second White House term.One of the more interesting markets that Polymarket offers is the US recession in 2025 market. During the April market mayhem, Polymarket put the odds of a recession at 66%. However, in just under two weeks, the Polymarket recession odds have plunged from a 66% to a 39% chance of a recession in 2025.Image Source: PolyMarketS&P 500, Nasdaq Retake 200-day Moving AverageMonday’s price action was rare. The day’s action marked the first instance since November 9th 2020 where the S&P 500 Index ETF ( SPY ) opened 3% or higher on a Monday morning. Back then, the Pfizer ( PFE ) COVID vaccine was announced calming market fears about a further spread of the pandemic. This time, thawing relations are responsible. In addition to the powerful price action, SPY crossed back over its 200-day moving average – the best metric to measure the long-term trend.Image Source: TradingViewWhat Does the VIX Reversion-to-the-Mean Tell Us?The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, measures Wall Street’s volatility expectations in the S&P 500 Index over the next month. VIX spikes above $45 historically parallel moments of extreme fear and capitulation in US equity markets. For instance, the VIX spiked above $45 in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and in 2020 during the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic pandemonium. Since 1988, the VIX has cycled from above $45 to under $20 six times. In each instance, the S&P 500 Index gained 9 months and a year later.Image Source: @subutradeIn the aftermath of the recent tariff meltdown, the VIX has triggered this signficant VIX cycle again. Will history repeat itself in 2025?The Trade-Deal Domino EffectNow that the US has a preliminary deal with the UK and China, I expect the trade deal scoreboard to morph into a domino effect. With each new deal, President Trump and his team will gain more leverage, making subsequent deals happen quicker and more often. In addition, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will gain more insight into the inflationary situation and will be more likely to cut interest rates and buoy equity markets.Bottom LineA surprising thaw in US-China trade relations sparked significant optimism on Wall Street Monday. This positive development, coupled with lower recession odds, sets up a bullish outlook for investors.

Consumer Stocks Have Taken It on the Chin. Buy These 8. — Barrons.com,1747936800000,"By Jacob SonenshineConsumer stocks are down, but not out. A handful look like buys now.The latest blow came on Wednesday when bond yields popped — and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund and the SPDR S&P Retail Exchange-Traded Fund fell 2% and 3.1%, respectively. The S&P 500 dropped 1.6%. Higher yields make borrowing money more expensive, which reduces consumer spending.Both funds had been on a rough stretch before Wednesday because of Wall Street's unease about the consumer companies' earnings. The higher bond yields are making investor sentiment worse, after what's been a steep drop in consumer confidence because of tariffs, which make good and services more expensive. For the year, the broader consumer discretionary ETF is off 4.5% and the retail ETF is down 5.4%. The S&P 500 has dropped only 0.5%.The silver lining is that there are select stocks that not only trade at cheaper prices now, but are also positioned for high earnings growth. Buying them right now makes sense.Citi strategist Scott Chronert looked for the ones to scoop up. He screened for consumer companies with sales that are relatively less sensitive to changes in broader economic activity, and have invested heavily in their businesses to spark high growth.Chronert started with 280 consumer stocks. He had two criteria for companies: sales less correlated to gross domestic product activity in recent years and capital expenditures that represent a relatively large ratio to annual depreciation expense. The second criteria is important because, as long-term assets depreciate, companies that are replacing those assets — and adding more — are signaling that they're prepared for ever-higher demand because they're aggressively growing.Names on the screen are Amazon.com, Costco, Tractor Supply, Procter & Gamble, Kroger, and Domino's Pizza.Another is Walmart. It's a rare retailer whose total sales aren't so sensitive to changes in consumer demand because the majority of its sales come from groceries.The discount chain has plenty of growth potential: Its total capital expenditures in the past five years, including analysts' estimates for this year, are $95 billion, about 1.6 times total depreciation expense in that period. So for every dollar of asset value lost, Walmart invests more than a dollar to increase its asset base. It's beefing up its capabilities for buy-online-pickup-in-store, e-commerce, and advertising.The idea is to add revenue streams and gradually take business from other retail outlets. That's why, after sales surpassed expectations in the first quarter, analysts expect just over 4% sales growth annually over the next three years to $768 billion, according to FactSet. That's nothing to scoff at for an already-large retailer that's outperforming other retailers. Target, for example, saw sales decline in the first quarter.Walmart's sales growth can nudge profit margins higher, which analysts forecast. If it needs to raise prices it can, though most of the growth in the first quarter came from more purchases rather than higher prices. As the advertising business ramps up, it can contribute to higher margins since the ad business generally has lower costs versus retail.Plus, Walmart is buying back stock every quarter, helping push analysts' EPS growth projections close to 10% annually.That can bring the stock higher, assuming shares aren't priced too expensively. They trade at what appears on the surface to be an expensive just over 35 times expected earnings for the coming 12 months. But at just over twice the retail fund's 14.8 times, it's about in line with the type of premium it has tended to fetch over the past couple of years, given its consistent earnings and growth trajectory.Walmart is a textbook example of a winning consumer stock right now. So are the other seven.Just remember: Consumer stocks aren't all the same. Take a look at a company's potential before you walk away.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

3 Reasons Why Disney Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q2 Earnings Beat,1747139040000,"Disney DIS delivered impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues, demonstrating strong momentum across its business segments. (Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)With shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.Impressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic ExecutionDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.These results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.The Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.Direct-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share. These projections suggest steady growth ahead.(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Streaming Profitability Achieved as Content Drives GrowthAfter years of heavy investment in its streaming platforms, Disney has successfully navigated the challenging transition from traditional media to direct-to-consumer models. The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.Disney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.The company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash . These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.Disney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.Shares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+. While Netflix has returned 24.5% year to date, shares of Amazon and Apple have lost 4.9% and 15.85%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceMultiple Growth Catalysts on the HorizonLooking ahead, Disney has several compelling growth catalysts that should drive shareholder value in the coming years.In sports, ESPN delivered its most-watched second quarter in primetime ever, with viewership among the key 18-49 demographic up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by marquee events like the USA/Canada 4 Nations Championship and Women's College Basketball, which saw its most-watched regular season in 16 years.The company is preparing to launch ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, which should further strengthen its position as the preeminent digital sports platform.Meanwhile, the Experiences segment delivered strong results, with Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income growing 13% compared to the prior-year quarter. At Disney Cruise Line, the Disney Treasure is now in its second full quarter of operations, with two more cruise ships joining the fleet later this year.Most impressive is Disney's unprecedented pipeline of expansion projects around the world, creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California. This includes special celebrations for Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary and Disneyland's historic 70th anniversary.The Bottom Line: Disney Offers Compelling Value at a DiscountBased on its strong second-quarter results and improved outlook, Disney stock appears significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company currently trades at just 19.25 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings, notably below the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry average of 21.37 times. This valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a premium media brand.DIS’ 3-Year P/E TTM Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationManagement has confidently raised guidance for fiscal 2025, now expecting adjusted EPS of approximately $5.75, representing a 16% increase over fiscal 2024. The company also projects approximately $17 billion in cash provided by operations, suggesting a $2 billion increase over prior guidance. This robust cash flow enables continued investments in growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through the company's share repurchase program.ConclusionWith its streaming services now profitable, box office hits driving multi-channel revenues, significant expansion projects underway in the Parks segment, and a valuation below industry averages, Disney offers investors exposure to multiple growth vectors with increasingly solid financial fundamentals. For investors looking for a blue-chip media and entertainment company with both defensive characteristics and growth potential, DIS stock appears to be a compelling buy at current levels.

Should You Add Alibaba Stock to Your Portfolio Ahead of Q4 Earnings?,1747138740000,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 15.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $33.08 billion, suggesting a 7.64% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.48 per share, indicating an increase of 5.71% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Alibaba has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.87%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average surprise being 1.47%.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and EPS SurpriseAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-eps-surprise | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteEarnings Whispers for BABAOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alibaba this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.BABA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to Note for BABA Ahead of Q4 ResultsAlibaba is expected to deliver robust results in its upcoming fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, building on the strong momentum from its impressive third-quarter performance. Investors should consider positioning themselves ahead of what appears to be another strong quarter, driven by accelerating AI initiatives and cloud computing growth.The company's strategic focus on ""user first, AI-driven"" strategies has already demonstrated substantial progress, with customer management revenues at Taobao and Tmall growing 9% in the third quarter, while Cloud revenue growth reignited to double digits at 13%, with AI-related product revenues achieving triple-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter.The fourth quarter witnessed Alibaba making several significant moves that are likely to have positively impacted upcoming results. The company unveiled an unprecedented RMB 380 billion ($53 billion) investment over the next three years in cloud computing and AI infrastructure — an amount exceeding Alibaba's total AI and cloud spending over the past decade. This bold commitment signals the company's determination to maintain its leadership in the global AI race.Alibaba Cloud continued its global expansion with new cloud regions in Mexico and Thailand, enhancing its international presence to 87 availability zones across 29 regions. These strategic expansions position the company to capture growing cloud computing demand in emerging markets while diversifying its revenue streams beyond China.The company's PolarDB achieved a groundbreaking world record in the TPC-C benchmark, processing 2.055 billion transactions per minute while reducing cost per transaction by almost 40%. This technological advancement showcases Alibaba's capability to deliver superior performance at lower costs, potentially attracting more enterprise clients to its cloud platform.Alibaba's AI innovation maintained impressive momentum with its QWQ-32B model topping popularity charts on Hugging Face with more than 80,000 downloads in just one week. Meanwhile, strategic partnerships with BMW, Honor, and Zeekr are expanding Alibaba's AI reach into automobiles and smartphones, creating new revenue opportunities beyond traditional cloud services.The company's international e-commerce business continued showing strength, with management expecting AIDC to achieve its first quarter of profitability in the next fiscal year. This progress toward profitability in international markets should boost investor confidence in Alibaba's global growth strategy.With BABA trading at compelling valuations relative to its growth prospects and AI leadership, the upcoming earnings report presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to China's technology sector and the booming global AI market.(See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)BABA Price Performance & Stock ValuationAlibaba shares have surged 56.3% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500 index’s decline of 3%, 1.4% and 4.4%, respectively.BABA faces tough competition from Amazon AMZN, JD.com JD and PDD Holdings PDD among others. While JD and PDD have gained 4% and 20%, respectively, in the year-to-date period, AMZN has lost 4.9%.Year-to-date Price PerformanceIt is also important to consider whether the stock's current valuation accurately reflects the company's long-term growth potential and ability to navigate the competitive landscape. Currently, BABA is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 11.91X compared with the industry’s 21.24X, making it an attractive buy opportunity for investors ahead of fiscal fourth-quarter results.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationInvestment ThesisAlibaba presents a compelling buy opportunity ahead of fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, with shares trading at a significant discount despite robust growth catalysts. The company's RMB 380 billion investment in AI and cloud infrastructure positions it at the forefront of technology innovation, while strategic partnerships with BMW, Honor, and Zeekr extend its AI ecosystem beyond traditional boundaries. Cloud revenue continues accelerating with AI-related products maintaining triple-digit growth for six consecutive quarters. Alibaba's international e-commerce segment approaches profitability, diversifying revenue streams. The launch of cutting-edge models like QWQ-32B and the record-breaking performance of PolarDB demonstrate technological leadership. Despite intense competition, Alibaba's discounted valuation fails to reflect its dominant market position and exceptional growth trajectory in the booming AI and cloud sectors.ConclusionAlibaba presents a rare opportunity at current valuations, with its aggressive AI investments and expanding global cloud footprint positioned to drive substantial growth. The company's triple-digit AI revenue growth, strategic partnerships, and breakthrough technological achievements create multiple catalysts ahead of furth-quarter results. As international e-commerce approaches profitability and cloud infrastructure scales, investors should act now before the market fully recognizes Alibaba's transformative potential in the AI era.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:de9037dd7094b:0-should-you-add-alibaba-stock-to-your-portfolio-ahead-of-q4-earnings/

How Should You Play CoreWeave Stock Going Into Q1 Earnings?,1747138260000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 14, after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 21 cents. The estimate has been unchanged in the past seven days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $850.4 million.This is CoreWeave’s first earnings release since it started trading as a listed company on March 28, 2025. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news).What Our Model Predicts for CRWV’s Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CRWV this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CRWV has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to Focus on Ahead of CRWV’s Q1 EarningsCoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company. CRWV’s cloud has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CoreWeave also boasts a growing data center network across the United States and Europe. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. CoreWeave's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.The rapid AI proliferation is transforming the entire tech scene, and AI infrastructure has become a high-stakes battleground for tech companies. Businesses have been increasing spending on AI inference/fine-tuning, AI workload monitoring, and training infrastructure, including training compute, AI servers, AI storage, cloud workloads and networking. This increasing demand for AI cloud platforms, including integrated software and the infrastructure, is likely to have cushioned CRWV’s topline performance. CoreWeave’s cloud Platform is hosted on a distributed network of active data centers. These data centers are connected to key metropolitan areas using low-latency connections and boast cutting-edge data center networking equipment and the latest liquid cooling technologies. As of Dec 31, 2024, CRWV’s 32 data centers were running more than 250,000 GPUs and were supported by more than 360 MW of active power.In May 2025, CRWV completed the acquisition of Weights & Biases to further bolster its cloud platform and expand business operations. Before that, it entered into an agreement with several financial institutions, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, for the expansion of its credit facility from $650 million to $1.5 billion and pushing out the maturity date. CRWV plans to utilize the proceeds to strengthen its AI cloud infrastructure platform.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material.CRWV Stock PerformanceCRWV shares have gained 34% in the past month. It has significantly outperformed the 12.8% gain of Zacks Internet Software industry and the 4.3% of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 6.5% over the same time frame. Price PerformanceThe company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 15.8% and 14.6%, respectively, in the same time frame.Investment Thesis for CRWV StockThe AI infrastructure market continues to expand rapidly in 2025, driven by demand for GPU-intensive applications, including large language models and inference-at-scale workloads. This bodes well for CRWV.Despite a robust market, CoreWeave faces tremendous competition from Azure, AWS and Google Cloud. Also, customer concentration and huge capex owing to data center expansion remain headwinds.What Should You Do With CRWV Stock Before Q1?With strong demand tailwinds, it seems a compelling opportunity, but one with competitive pressures and capital risks that investors need to closely monitor.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5c43dc210094b:0-how-should-you-play-coreweave-stock-going-into-q1-earnings/
Startup Anthropic says its new AI model can code for hours at a time,1747936024000,"Artificial intelligence lab Anthropic unveiled its latest top-of-the-line technology called Claude Opus 4 on Thursday, which it says can write computer code autonomously for much longer than its prior systems.The startup, backed by Google-parent Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , has distinguished its work in part by building AI that excels at coding. It also announced another AI model Claude Sonnet 4, Opus's smaller and more cost-effective cousin.Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger called the release a milestone in Anthropic's work to make increasingly autonomous AI. He said in an interview with Reuters that customer Rakuten had Opus 4 coding for nearly seven hours, while an Anthropic researcher set up the AI model to play 24 hours of a Pokemon game. That's up from about 45 minutes of game play for its prior model Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic told MIT Technology Review.""For AI to really have the economic and productivity impact that I think it can have, the models do need to be able to work autonomously and work coherently for that (longer) amount of time,"" he said.The news follows a flurry of other AI announcements this week, including from Google, with which Anthropic also competes. Anthropic also said its new AI models can give near-instant answers or take longer to reason through questions, as well as do web search. And it said its Claude Code tool for software developers was now generally available after Anthropic had previewed it in February.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU0V9:0-startup-anthropic-says-its-new-ai-model-can-code-for-hours-at-a-time/"

"Should You Buy, Hold or Sell OKTA Stock Before Q1 Earnings Release?",1747930320000,"Okta OKTA is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 27.For the fiscal first quarter of 2026, Okta anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of 76-77 cents per share. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $678-$680 million, indicating growth of 10% from the year-ago period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at 77 cents per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.46%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $679.73 million, indicating an increase of 10.17% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Okta’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 15.70%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Okta, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseOkta, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Okta, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA’s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon’s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. Okta’s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts. With more than 70% of deals influenced by partners in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Okta was able to leverage its security capabilities more effectively. In fact, OKTA surpassed $1 billion in aggregate total contract value through its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Benefits from this partnership are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.OKTA Shares Outperform Sector, IndustryOkta shares have surged 54.9% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 2%. The Zacks Security industry has increased 17.1% in the same time frame. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong demand for its identity security solutions and rich partner base.OKTA Stock's PerformanceOKTA Stock is Currently OvervaluedOKTA stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, OKTA is trading at 7.22X, higher than the Computer & Technology broader sector’s 6.14X.Price/Sales(F12M)OKTA Suffers From Stiff CompetitionOkta’s robust portfolio is helping it expand its clientele. It benefits from positive industry trends, including growing demand for identity solutions.However, the company faces stiff competition from CyberArk CYBR and Microsoft MSFT, which are also rapidly expanding its footprint in the identity and access management space.This competitive pressure is highlighted by Microsoft’s strong performance in the security segment. Microsoft’s Entra identity offering now serves more than 900 million monthly active users. Furthermore, Microsoft now serves 1.4 million security customers in the security segment, with more than 900,000 of these customers utilizing four or more workloads, representing a 21% year-over-year increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.CyberArk is also making advancements to strengthen its position. In April 2025, CyberArk announced the CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution, which will allow organizations to implement identity-first security for agentic AI using the CyberArk Identity Security Platform.ConclusionOkta is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions due to higher tariffs, which could put pressure on its future performance. Intense competition and stretched valuation also remain a concern. These factors could affect the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter despite strong product momentum.OKTA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should stay away from investing in this stock at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c794ac4b094b:0-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-okta-stock-before-q1-earnings-release/

Funds Kept Shifting Out of U.S. Stocks as Rally Picked Up — Barrons.com,1747134600000,"By Brian SwintEven as stock prices rose over the past month, fund managers continued to shift money away from U.S. equities.That's one counterintuitive reading from the latest Bank of America Fund Manager Survey on Tuesday. Investors are a net 38% underweight U.S. stocks in May, more so than a month earlier, the report showed. At the same time, they're the most overweight euro-area equities versus the U.S. since October 2017.That suggests many may have missed the rally as the S&P exited a correction and the Nasdaq entered a new bull market. The survey was conducted from May 2 to May 8 — before this week's news that the U.S. and China will sharply reduce tariffs for 90 days as trade talks continue.Other results were less surprising. Traders are less bearish — in other words, they aren't as likely to expect stocks to fall. They've decreased allocations into cash and fewer think that a recession is likely this year. After yesterday's rally, the S&P 500 is up more than 8% over the past 30 days.However, one safe-haven play is still popular. Fund managers said that buying gold was now the most crowded trade for a second month. Before that, buying the Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — was considered the most popular trade for 24 months straight.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

US FTC chair seeks to trim agency by around 10%,1747327488000,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is looking to trim its headcount by around 10%, its chairman told Congress on Thursday, insisting the agency will be able to continue antitrust and consumer protection work with what would be its smallest staff in 10 years.The FTC is in the midst of an ""unprecedented time,"" pursuing antimonopoly cases against companies including Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN and Deere & Co NYSE:DE , while going after the largest pharmacy benefit managers over insulin pricing, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson told a U.S. House of Representatives panel. But he said shrinking the agency further would not hamper that work.""In terms of accomplishing our mission, we can accomplish the mission with 1,100 employees. I have no doubt about it. Because our people are really, really good, and we have shifted our priority, especially away from rulemaking,"" Ferguson said.So far this year, 94 employees have departed the agency, leaving 1,221 full-time employees, Ferguson said. While it laid off a handful of probationary employees, the agency is offering buyouts and has not yet enacted reductions in force.Ferguson did not disclose the details of the FTC's budget request, but said around 1,100 was a healthy staffing level given the agency's current funding.

Responding to the trade deal, MAGS ETF surged 5.8% on May 12. The ETF has, in fact, surged 12.9% over the past month.The recent rebound follows a rough period for Big Tech after President Donald Trump announced a ""reciprocal tariff"" plan on April 2, which wiped out $2 trillion in cumulative market cap from the Magnificent Seven.Mag-7 Stock Performance Highlights Post US-China Trade TruceAmazon and Meta Platforms spearheaded a significant rally among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks on May 12 afternoon, following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China.Stock Performance Highlights Amazon surged 8.1% and Meta climbed 7.9% on May 12. Tesla gained 6.8%, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion. Apple rose 6.3%. NVIDIA jumped 5.4%. Google shares increased 3.4%. Microsoft added 2.4%.Trade Truce DetailsThe United States agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on Chinese imports. The United States cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered American levies from 125% to 10%.These reductions will last 90 days, following two days of high-stakes talks between the two nations. The new tariffs on small packages sent from China worth up to $800 have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement.Bullish Outlook for Tech SectorThe trade development is highly optimistic for tech stocks, particularly due to the easing of supply-chain concerns. Along with Apple, Tesla is also heavily dependent on Chinese parts and battery suppliers. No wonder, both shares surged. Moreover, Tesla is expected to debut its self-driving Taxi in June.Impact of China on Big TechAmazon : 30% of product value on its platform comes from China; Chinese advertisers made up 14% of ad revenues in 2024, per Raymond James, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Meta : Chinese advertisers contributed roughly 11% of total ad spending, Raymon James noted.Google : Chinese advertisers accounted for about 6% of ad revenues, Raymon James indicated.Apple : 90% of iPhones are manufactured in China, representing 17% of 2024 revenues .NVIDIA : Chinese clients make up between 20% and 40% of the company’s end customer base, according to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Any Wall of Worry?Despite the temporary truce, the United States has imposed export bans on NVIDIA’s H20 AI chips to China, which has pressured NVDA shares.

However, no one still underrates the opportunities in the Mag-7 group.ETF PicksAnd if you want to go for group-wide picks, you have options like MAGS,  Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF  MGK,  Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF  XLG and  iShares S&P 100 ETF  OEF to play on.Meta-heavy ETFs like Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF  FCOM can be played for specific stock preference.

'De minimis': the trade perk Trump ended as part of China tariffs,1747130721000,"The Trump administration ended U.S. duty-free access for low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong on May 2, removing the ""de minimis"" exemptions used by Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods. Following talks in Geneva between China and the U.S. aimed at cooling a trade war, the White House on May 13 released its latest tariff rates for small packages valued at up to $800. These items sent from China to the U.S. via postal services are now subject to a tax of 54% of the package's value, or a flat fee of $100 per package. This is significantly lower than the 120% tariff that had been levied on packages from May 2. Trump accuses China of unfair trade practices and blames it for a crisis over the deadly drug fentanyl.WHAT IS DE MINIMIS?De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, describes the U.S. waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on imported items worth less than $800 that are shipped to individuals.It is one of the most generous such exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156). The U.S. has used de minimis since 1938 to reduce administrative burdens. During Barack Obama's presidency, Congress quadrupled the waiver from $200, facilitating an explosion in the number of exempted packages entering the country. Shipments claiming de minimis have soared more than 600% over the past decade to over 1 billion items in fiscal 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection data.WHY IS DE MINIMIS CONTROVERSIAL?Contentions largely concern U.S. trade imbalances and the synthetic opioid fentanyl - which is fuelling a national epidemic that killed nearly 75,000 people in 2023.Reuters reporters last year found they could easily import the core precursors for at least 3 million fentanyl tablets - with a potential street value of $3 million – at a cost of $3,607.18. The shippers mislabelled the packages as, for instance, electronics.Legitimate products, too, are controversial as Trump ramps up his rhetoric against China, with which the U.S. has its largest bilateral trade deficit, at $279 billion as of 2023.Big beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, PDD Holdings-owned NASDAQ:PDD Temu and Alibaba's NYSE:BABA AliExpress. Their growth prompted U.S. rival Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.Shein declined to comment on possible changes to U.S. de minimis policy. In 2023, the company called for de minimis reform ""to create a level, transparent playing field – where the rules are applied evenly and equally"". Temu, AliExpress and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.Critics of de minimis also say it lets companies evade tariffs on Chinese goods and customs inspections under a law banning products made with forced labour.CHINA GDP IMPACTChina exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.The brokerage forecasts that eliminating the U.S. threshold would slow Chinese export growth by 1.3 percentage points and GDP growth by 0.2 point, with a significantly bigger hit if Europe and Southeast Asia also removed their minimum requirements for customs duties.China's most exposed sectors include apparel, which makes up 35% of China's direct-to-consumer exports by value, consumer electronics at 22%, home decor at 17% and beauty products at 7%, Nomura reckons.($1 = 0.9639 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL0AU:0-de-minimis-the-trade-perk-trump-ended-as-part-of-china-tariffs/"
US companies announce layoffs to cut costs,1747911628000,"U.S. companies across sectors have initiated layoffs as they attempt to streamline operations amid economic uncertainties, following similar cutbacks seen last year.Job openings — a measure of labor demand — decreased 288,000 to 7.192 million by the last day of March, according to the labor department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report. But layoffs also declined, suggesting that the labor market remained on solid footing despite an ever-shifting tariffs policy under U.S. President Donald Trump. Here are some of the companies that have announced job cuts so far in 2025:* UnitedHealth was offering employees in its benefits operations unit the option to accept buyouts in February and may pursue layoffs if the resignation quota is not met, according to a CNBC report.* Morgan Stanley layoffs are aimed at improving operational efficiency and unrelated to current market conditions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU0QF:0-us-companies-announce-layoffs-to-cut-costs/"

US slashes 'de minimis' tariff on small China parcels to as low as 30%,1747121828000,"The U.S. will cut the ""de minimis"" tariff for low-value shipments from China to as low as 30%, according to a White House executive order and industry experts, further de-escalating a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies. The order published late on Monday offers some relief to big Chinese e-commerce players Shein and Temu NASDAQ:PDD and follows a weekend deal between Beijing and Washington to unwind for 90 days most of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on each other's goods since early April.While their joint statement following talks in Geneva did not mention the de minimis duties, the order signed by President Donald Trump said levies for those direct-to-consumer postal shipments will be reduced to 54% from 120% for items valued at up to $800, starting on Wednesday. An alternative flat fee of $100 per postal package remains in effect, but a planned June 1 increase to $200 was cancelled.There are different rules for packages handled by commercial delivery firms such as United Parcel Service NYSE:UPS , FedEx NYSE:FDX and DHL XETR:DHL , which shipped millions of Shein and Temu packages before Trump ended duty-free status for Chinese shipments valued under $800.The rate for those packages now defaults to the reduced U.S. tariff rate of 30% from 145% for Chinese imports, two delivery experts told Reuters on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.The 30% rate reflects the Trump administration's decision to cut China's ""reciprocal"" duty rate to 10% from 145%, plus a separate 20% duty related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis. The White House and the U.S. Trade Representative's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Tuesday that the 10% global duty rate would likely remain in place to help rebuild the U.S. manufacturing base.COLLECTION DIFFICULTIESCommercial shippers generally collect duties from sellers in China prior to shipment, but the U.S. Postal Service is not set up to handle tariff collections. Four sources told Reuters most Temu and Shein shipments are handled by commercial carriers.Many consumer goods from China in the commercial channel will still be subject to much higher duties imposed under previous trade actions or sectoral national security investigations. For example, syringes and surgical gloves are subject to 100% duties under a U.S. Section 301 trade action.One of the delivery experts said, however, that if shipped by a postal carrier in quantities valued at less than $800, they may be able to arrive in the U.S. for only a $100 fee, or an effective 12.5% rate. In February, Trump ended the de minimis exemption and imposed different rules for packages handled by postal services or commercial delivery firms - blaming the exemption for enabling a flood of shipments from Chinese e-commerce firms and traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.The number of shipments entering the U.S. through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.According to 2024 congressional testimony from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official, the average value of a de minimis shipment during fiscal year 2023 was just $54.Chinese online retailers Shein - which is considering a London stock market listing - and PDD Holdings-owned NASDAQ:PDD Temu, as well as U.S. rival Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.Jianlong Hu, CEO of Brands Factory, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce consultancy, said a 54% tariff was still very high.""Sellers are probably taking a wait-and-see approach but in general I think it's fair to say the boom times of small package delivery from China to the U.S., the Golden Age is already gone.""Shein is more exposed to de minimis changes due to its reliance on speed of getting thousands of new styles each week to consumers in the West by air than others such as Temu. Shein might still be one player that would want to send by air freight some packages from China and pay the 54% tariff rather than import all by boat, said Hu. ""If people are buying clothes on Shein and are told the product will arrive one month later, who will buy that?""LOOPHOLEChina's yuan FX_IDC:USDCNY jumped to a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, joining a global rally in riskier assets following the broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington.Trump's global trade war , which shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade for decades, has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession. The U.S. de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers as a loophole that allows Chinese products to skirt U.S. tariffs and illegal drugs and fentanyl precursors to enter the U.S. unscreened, as Reuters reporting has confirmed.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL079:0-us-slashes-de-minimis-tariff-on-small-china-parcels-to-as-low-as-30/"

Spotify Stock Skyrockets 112% in a Year: What's Next for Investors?,1747319040000,"Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT shares have skyrocketed 112.4% in a year, outperforming the 32.5% rally of its industry and the 12.4% rise in the Zacks S&P 500 Composite.SPOT has outperformed its streaming rivals Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN for the same period. Apple and Amazon have jumped 12.4% and 14.5% in the past year.One-Year Price PerformanceThe massive rise in Spotify shares may appeal to investors. However, the eminent question that lingers is whether it is the right to invest in SPOT.SPOT’s Growth Catalyst is Its User Base ExpansionSpotify demonstrated an impressive first-quarter 2025 performance, driven by user growth. The company added nearly 3 million monthly active users (MAU) and 5 million net new subscribers in a single quarter, portraying its ability to attract and retain users globally. This growing user base acts as a vital asset for revenue growth in the future. It not only boosts direct premium subscriptions but also enhances the potential to monetize its ad-supported tier.This strong user rise lays a solid ground for positive developments. Latching onto its continued scalability, the company reinforces its network effects, attracting more users and content creators. Also, Spotify’s CEO’s aspirational vision of touching 1 billion subscribers shines a light on its long-term growth trajectory.The company can improve its top and bottom line by a huge margin, given that it can achieve the desired number and can exercise strategic price adjustments in mature markets. Initiatives like the Spotify Partner Program, targeted at onboarding more video podcasters, hold the potential to widen the platform’s content offerings. This will also attract a wide audience and fuel further MAU growth and engagement in the long run.Spotify is well-positioned to zoom past its competitors and become the dominant audio streaming platform by capitalizing on its user base expansion, and tactfully investing in monetization and content strategy.Spotify’s Promising Top & Bottom-Line ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPOT’s 2025 and 2026 revenues is pegged at $19.9 billion and 22.8 billion, implying 17.4% and 14.3% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus estimate for Spotify’s 2025 and 2026 earnings per share stands at $9.88 and $13.69, suggesting 66.1% and 38.5% year-over-year increases, respectively.SPOT’s Liquidity Position Lags IndustrySpotify’s current ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2025 stood at 1.48, which sets a good tone for investors. However, something that can raise concern is its stance when compared with the industry average. Currently, the industry average is 2.54, which is substantially higher than SPOT’s current ratio. Adding to this concern, the metric has declined 21% from the preceding quarter. If continued, it can hurt the company’s liquidity position. Intense Competition Hurts SpotifyApple Music and Amazon Music are the most notable competitors of Spotify. The financial strength of these companies is something to look out for. These major players can use their financial prowess to reduce streaming prices, and lower or limit content availability, thereby hurting SPOT’s monetization strategy.Such an incident can bleed into hurting the company’s stock price. Strong reliance on third-party content licenses exposes Spotify to royalty cost hikes, affecting margins as the company expands its content offerings to include audiobooks and video.SPOT Stock Looks PriceySpotify’s stock price increase led to elevated valuations. It is priced at 56.1 times forward 12-month earnings per share, which is higher than the industry’s average of 37.8 times. When looking at the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA ratio, Spotify is trading at 62.1 times, far exceeding the industry’s average of 13.5 times. Spotify: Wait & WatchSPOT’s user base expansion is the key to success as it positions the company well for revenue growth. The company provides a strong top and bottom-line outlook, which favors its long-term growth objective.Spotify’s robust liquidity position reaffirms its financial strength. However, the market in which the company operates poses a substantial threat to its performance. Adding to this concern is its premium valuation, hurting investor sentiment.We recommend investors take a cautious approach and initiate a “Hold” strategy. Increasing exposure is suggested after signs of lasting growth and a more attracting valuation appears.Spotify carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

"US to cut 'de minimis' tariff on China shipments, bolsters broader trade truce",1747115965000,"The United States will cut the low value ""de minimis"" tariff on China shipments, a White House executive order said on Monday, further de-escalating a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies. The move comes several hours after Beijing and Washington announced a truce in their trade spat after weekend talks in Geneva, with both sides agreeing to unwind most of the tariffs imposed on each other's goods since early April.While their joint statement in Geneva didn't mention the de minimis duties, the White House order released later said the levies will be reduced to 54% from 120%, with a flat fee of $100 to remain, starting from May 14. The de minimis exemption, for items valued at up to $800 and sent from China via postal services, were previously able to enter the United States duty free and with minimal inspections. In February, President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption by imposing a tax of 120% of the package's value or a planned flat fee of $200 - set to come into effect by June - blaming it for being heavily used by companies such as Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.The number of shipments entering the U.S. through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.Chinese online retailers Shein, PDD Holdings-owned NASDAQ:PDD Temu and U.S. rival Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In Monday's order, the White House said the reduced tariffs will take effect by 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT)on May 14, 2025. The plan for a $200 flat fee duty rate would also be shelved, it said, keeping it at $100. BREATHING ROOMThe U.S. de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Some have derided it as a loophole that allows cheap Chinese products to flood into the United States and undercut American industries, while also serving as cover for smuggling contraband such as illegal drugs and their precursor chemicals.De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance which describes the U.S. waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs, was one of the most generous exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156).The Geneva agreement slashed tariffs for both the United States and China by 115 percentage points, to 10% and 30%, respectively, for at least 90 days. The tariff pause will give online retailers like Shein and Temu breather space to adapt their businesses, say industry experts, as online retailers are likely to use the time to bring in bulk shipments and restock their U.S. warehouses. Big beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba's NYSE:BABA AliExpress. Their growth prompted Amazon to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RL04Z:0-us-to-cut-de-minimis-tariff-on-china-shipments-bolsters-broader-trade-truce/"

European regulators crack down on Big Tech,1747317006000,"European regulators have launched a series of investigations into Big Tech in recent years.Here are some of the actions taken:DIGITAL SERVICES ACTTech companies are required to do more to tackle illegal and harmful content on their platforms under the EU's Digital Services Act that came into effect last year.Social media app TikTok was charged by the European Commission on May 15 for failing to comply with the DSA's obligation to publish an advertisement repository that allows researchers and users to detect scam advertisements, with its owner ByteDance now at risk of a fine of as much as 6% of its global turnover.This marks only the second ruling by EU tech regulators following the introduction of the DSA, after Elon Musk's social media network X was charged with breaching its content rules last year.Meta's Facebook and Instagram are being investigated for potential breaches of EU online content rules relating to child safety, which could lead to hefty fines, the Commission said in May 2024.DIGITAL MARKETS ACTThe European Union's Digital Markets Act took effect in 2022 with the aim of curbing the power of Big Tech and ensuring a level playing field for smaller rivals.Apple NASDAQ:AAPL was fined 500 million euros ($570 million) and Meta NASDAQ:META 200 million euros under the DMA on April 23. People with direct knowledge of the matter had in March said the fines would be modest, as the antitrust enforcer was focused on making sure companies comply with the law rather than sanctioning them.The investigations were part of three probes started by the European Commission, which acts as the EU competition watchdog.The EC is also investigating Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google over possible breaches, and charged Meta last July for failing to comply with the DMA in its new pay or consent advertising model.In September 2023, the EU named 22 ""gatekeeper"" services run by Alphabet, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Apple, Meta, Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and TikTok-owner ByteDance, giving them six months to comply with the provisions of the DMA.Meta and TikTok appealed against the gatekeeper status in November 2023, with the latter losing a bid to suspend its designation in February 2024. Apple said in April 2024 it would continue to engage with the Commission to comply with the rules.ANTITRUSTThe European Commission fined Meta 797.72 million euros in November for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.In September, Google won its challenge against a 1.49-billion-euro antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising.A week earlier, Google lost its fight against a 2.42-billion-euro fine by EU antitrust regulators seven years ago for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.On the same day, Apple lost the fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, as part of a larger crackdown against sweetheart deals between multinationals and EU countries.Regulators said last July that Apple had agreed to open its tap-and-go mobile payments system to rivals to settle an EU antitrust probe.

Amazon Seals New Partnership With FedEx for Delivering Large Packages,1747088040000,"By Connor HartAmazon.com has added FedEx as a partner to deliver select large packages to homes for the online retailer, as the two companies find more ways to do business together after a previous split.""We've reached an agreement with FedEx to serve as one of several third-party partners to deliver packages to our customers,"" Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly said Monday.He added that the Memphis, Tenn., company will join other third-party partners including United Parcel Service and the U.S. Postal Service that regularly work alongside Amazon's last-mile delivery network to balance capacity.Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. FedEx described the partnership as a mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement.Amazon and FedEx have explored doing more business with each other in recent years, following the companies' high-profile split in 2019.The partnership between Amazon and FedEx comes after UPS earlier this year said it plans to phase out more than half of the business it does with the online retailer over the next 18 months. Amazon accounted for about 12% of UPS's revenue last year, or about $1.07 billion.The move resulted in UPS last month disclosing plans to slash expenses, including the elimination of about 20,000 operational positions and closing more than 70 leased and owned buildings.The FedEx deal is not meant to replace Amazon's prior deal with UPS, and any claims to the contrary are incorrect, Amazon said. More than two-thirds of Amazon packages are delivered via Amazon's own logistics network in the U.S., according to the company.Write to Connor Hart at connor.hart@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250512012516:0-amazon-seals-new-partnership-with-fedex-for-delivering-large-packages/

"U.S., Chinese Markets Cruise on Cooling Trade Tensions",1747087260000,"Monday, May 12, 2025Markets posted one of its strongest sessions of 2025 so far. We’ve had a volatile first half of the year, and we might expect that volatility to continue. But with all the ups and downs, today’s big day into the green has brought the S&P 500 within 5% of its all-time trading high. The Dow and S&P 500 are within 1% of posting profits year to date.The Dow shot up 1160 points today, for a +2.81% gain — and it was the laggard among the major indexes. The S&P 500 grew +184 points, +3.26%. The Nasdaq, which one the day on strength in tech stocks, was up a whopping +779 points, +4.35%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained +68 points, +3.40%.Of course, the catalyst for this seismic shift comes from the agreement between the U.S. and China to pause their reciprocal tariffs (which had ballooned to +145% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and +125% on U.S. exports to China). Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META were both up +8% today, leading the way for “Mag 7” stocks.Chinese stocks also saw a bounce today, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining +3% today, for its best trading day since March. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar is back up to its one-month high, and Gold — which had been a demonstrative hedge when the equities market was melting away, just a few short weeks ago — is down -3% today.What to Expect from the Stock Market TomorrowThe big news tomorrow — though unlikely to make as big a splash as this tariff pause did today — is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April. Headline month over month CPI is expected to provide the biggest swing: +0.2% versus -0.1% reported a month ago, +0.3% on core versus +0.1% for March. Year over year, headline is expected to remain steady at +2.4%, and steady at +2.8% on core year over year.These figures, should they come in as expected, would still be notably above the optimal levels the Fed targets for inflation. Market strength and an absence of economic troubles that harsh tariff policies set in motion will likely keep any interest rate cuts at bay for now anyway, with the probability of a June rate cut tumbling from 64.4% to 8.1% today. The highest probability for the first cut of 2025 is currently the September meeting. Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Best Gig Economy Stocks to Monitor Amid its Growing Popularity,1747313580000,"An updated edition of the March 25, 2025 article.The emergence of the gig economy concept has reshaped the landscape of traditional employment. The gig economy offers workers the freedom and flexibility to set their work hours, workload, and even their workspace. The resultant flexibility helps accommodate diverse lifestyles and personal commitments. No wonder this trend gained immense popularity, both during and in the post-pandemic scenario, with workers and companies constantly seeking more flexible and innovative work arrangements.The gig economy concept encourages workers to engage in short-term, freelance, or contract-based work. The advantages associated with the gig economy are being utilized by multiple companies, ranging from rideshares like Uber UBER and Lyft LYFT to food delivery entities like DoorDash DASH. Moreover, platforms like  Upwork  UPWK and  Fiverr  FVRR connect skilled freelancers with businesses for short-term projects, in turn allowing professionals to choose their schedules.Agreed that this flexibility comes at the cost of job security and benefits like healthcare and retirement plans associated with traditional employment. However, the lure of being one’s own boss often overrides these disadvantages. With a focus on work-life balance, the gig economy concept is gaining immense popularity. This can be gauged from the fact that the gig economy market is expected to reach $648.8 billion in 2025 and $2.15 trillion by 2033, from $556.7 billion in 2024. This implies that the market is likely to witness a compound annual growth rate of about 16.2% in the 2025-2033 timeframe.These numbers showcase the immense potential for gig economy-focused companies. With our thematic screens, one can easily spot stocks tied to trends shaping the future of investing. If the gig economy appeals to you and you’re looking to align your portfolio with this rising trend, now might be the time to consider stocks like  Amazon  AMZN, Lyft, and Angi ANGI.Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with  Zacks Thematic Screens   and uncover your next big opportunity.Amazon ’ s dominance extends far beyond e-commerce. The company is a significant player in the gig economy by offering flexible, short-term work opportunities through multiple programs like Flex, Delivery Service Partners (DSP), Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and its tech backbone, Amazon Web Services (AWS).Flex, launched in 2015, allows drivers to deliver packages using their own vehicles, offering flexible schedules and supplementary income. In 2018, DSP took things further, enabling entrepreneurs to launch delivery businesses, allowing them to hire drivers, lease vans and manage local deliveries. On the digital side, MTurk brings crowdsourcing to life. This platform connects businesses with a global pool of freelancers for tasks like data tagging and survey participation. Meanwhile, AWS serves as the gig economy’s cloud computing powerhouse. It powers platforms like Uber and DoorDash, ensuring seamless operations.By combining delivery, crowdsourcing, and cloud computing, Amazon has emerged as a major player in the gig economy space. Through its endeavors, the company is streamlining business processes and providing gig workers with new opportunities. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Lyft  is one of the leading players in the ride-hailing segment, providing drivers with a flexible platform to earn income using personal vehicles. It generates most of its revenues from ridesharing, where drivers pay service fees and commissions for using its platform. The company’s offerings extend beyond ride-hailing to include shared rides, electric bike and scooter rentals and public transit partnerships.Lyft’s drivers can choose when and how much they work, offering flexibility and autonomy. The company’s gig-based approach permits drivers to work part-time or full-time and choose their work schedule. Their income is determined by the fares they earn from rides, which also includes potential surge pricing during peak demand. However, expenses like fuel and maintenance are deducted to arrive at net profit.Lyft utilizes its platform to connect riders with drivers, offering a flexible and on-demand transportation service. By consistently focusing on providing opportunities for flexible income, Lyft underscores the value and potential of gig-based transportation solutions, making it a vital part of the modern workforce. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Angi  highlights the evolving nature of the gig economy by bridging the gap between homeowners and skilled service professionals. Angi's focus on the gig economy has contributed to its growth as a leading online marketplace for home services in the United States.Angi, through its subsidiary Handy Technologies, highlights the evolution of the gig economy into home services. Handy Technologies offers services in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. It is an online two-sided marketplace (an intermediary economic platform, having two distinct user groups that provide each other with network benefits) for residential cleaning, installation and other home services.The platform acts as a marketplace where independent contractors — from electricians and plumbers to landscapers and handymen — can connect with consumers needing services. By leveraging technology, Angi not only streamlines the process of finding reliable professionals but also supports flexible, on-demand work for these gig workers.

Stocks to Watch as the U.S. & China Reach a Trade Deal,1747086840000,"Stocks surged on Monday as the U.S. and China announced a deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs, leading to much optimism that a global economic recession may be avoided.Easing an ongoing trade war, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, with China reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement will last 90 days, as the two sides work on building a sustainable, long-term trade relationship.The S&P 500 rose +3% in today’s trading session, with the Nasdaq spiking over +4%, as investors flock to big tech stocks that had sold off during rising trade tensions.The Mag 7 At the center of what has been a historic market rebound are the mega-cap big tech stocks, with Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Tesla TSLA leading the market gains on Monday and up over +6% respectively. It’s likely that analysts may become more bullish on Apple’s short-term outlook as most of the electronic giant’s production comes from China. A continued run-up in Apple, Amazon, and Meta stock looks fundamentally plausible, but it’s noteworthy that Tesla lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on a trend of declining earnings estimate revisions. Suggesting now may be a good time to fade the rally in Tesla stock is that TSLA has spiked +25% in the last month. Furthermore, Tesla has the highest P/E valuation among the Mag 7 at 161.4X forward earnings, with Alphabet GOOGL being the cheapest at 16.2X.Nvidia NVDA and Microsoft MSFT have started to gain nice momentum as well, although the latter was only up +2% today. Still, Microsoft is the only Mag 7 stock that currently has a buy rating with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the others all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) outside of Tesla’s strong sell rating. This comes as fiscal 2025 EPS estimates for Microsoft are up 2% over the last 60 days, with FY26 EPS estimates up 1%. Alibaba & TencentOptimistically, Chinese tech stocks have already benefited from higher investor sentiment before the tariff truce with the U.S., as Chinese President Xi Jinping has been more supportive of their independent growth. With regulatory issues being less of a concern to investors, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY are two Chinese tech stocks to pay attention to and currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Their ADR’s (American Depository Receipts) have been two of the top performers on U.S. stock exchanges this year, with BABA soaring nearly +60% year to date and TCEHY up over +20%. The strong price performance has been due to their artificial intelligence expansion, leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience, as Alibaba has seen higher e-commerce sales, and Tencent has benefited from growth in its gaming and cloud services. Retail Stocks Outside of Amazon and Apple, retailers like Nike NKE, Starbucks SBUX, and even Walmart WMT and Target TGT rely heavily on supply chain operations from China. Nike and Starbucks also generate a significant portion of their revenue from their operations within China, which would make better trade and political relations between the U.S. and China beneficial to their outlook.Nike and Walmart stock stand out with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Starbucks and Target have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Plus, China accounted for 14% of Nike’s revenue in 2024, with $5.5 billion coming from footwear sales alone, as shown in the chart below.Image Source: StatistaEnergy & Transportation Stocks Energy and transportation stocks will also be important to watch, as they could receive a continued boost in the following weeks thanks to today’s trade agreement. While geopolitical tensions can often cause an uptick in crude oil prices, the trade war between the U.S. and China had an adverse effect in regard to how the market saw future demand for travel and other activities that require higher energy production. Crude prices were up as much as +2% to over $62 a barrel but are still down 20% in 2025.Image Source: Trading Economics Bottom Line The U.S. and China trade agreement gave the market what it was looking for, as investors now have more reassurance that the global economy will be less impacted by higher tariffs. That said, keeping an eye on the progress that is hopefully made in the next 90 days will be critical, considering the U.S. and China are the world's two largest economies.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7a4eb6869094b:0-stocks-to-watch-as-the-u-s-china-reach-a-trade-deal/

Amazon signs up FedEx for residential deliveries,1747084407000,"Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN has hired FedEx NYSE:FDX to handle some of its large package deliveries, the companies said on Monday, weeks after UPS said it was halting its less-profitable deliveries for the e-commerce retailer and cutting 20,000 jobs. FedEx shares surged on Monday even more than rallying Wall Street benchmarks, finishing up 7%. The Memphis-based delivery company said the multi-year agreement covers residential delivery of select large packages for Amazon.The deal with FedEx, signed in February, gives Amazon ""cost favorability"" compared with delivery rival UPS, Business Insider had reported, citing an internal document.The agreement will not replace UPS, Amazon said as FedEx will join its third-party partners, including UPS and the USPS, and work alongside its own last-mile delivery network. FedEx called it a ""mutually beneficial, multi-year agreement"" in a statement. The deal may signal a thaw in relations between FedEx and Amazon. The companies cut residential delivery ties in 2019 as Amazon was building its now sprawling network of delivery services.UPS NYSE:UPS said in January it plans to shrink shipment volumes for Amazon, its largest customer, by more than 50% by the second half of 2026 to focus on fewer, but more profitable deliveries.Late last month, UPS said it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as a part of its planned reduction in Amazon deliveries, as well as cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring.FedEx and UPS have been in a fierce battle for market share over the last five years, often poaching whole or partial customer accounts from the other.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1RT:0-amazon-signs-up-fedex-for-residential-deliveries/"

Nordstrom Stock Just Delisted. Macy's and Dillard's Are the Department Stores Left Standing. — Barrons.com,1747855320000,"By Teresa RivasAnd then there were two.Macy's and Dillard's are the only publicly traded traditional, mall-based department stores now that Nordstrom's has gone private.JWN is no more. After years of will-they-or-won't-they speculation and failed deals, the Nordstrom family finally found a buyer for their Seattle-based retail chain — and the stock was delisted on Wednesday.The acquisition, announced near the end of last year, is an all-cash acquisition priced at $24.25 a share in partnership with Mexican department store operator El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. The Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company and Liverpool will own the other 49.9%.The Nordstrom family had owned about a third of Nordstrom's shares outstanding and Liverpool had owned approximately 10%. The deal, which shareholders signed off on earlier this month, includes a special dividend of 25 cents.That's a far cry from the $50 per-share offer the family had made in 2018. Then again, the retail landscape has essentially been transformed. One of the few constants is the incredibly shrinking footprint of the department store.Today, just Macy's and Dillard's are the stocks for those who want to invest in the true traditional department store.Once a mainstay of American retail, department stores were KO'd by e-commerce and discounters like TJ Maxx and Marshalls.Most went down for the count — remember Barney's? — though a few of the old names got back up but are beyond dazed. J.C. Penney and Sears operate a handful of stores postbankruptcy, and Lord and Taylor and Mervyns live online only.So it's up to Macy's and Dillard's to carry on the fight.Macy's has never retaken its 2015 all-time high. The stock is down about 40% in the past year, leaving it with a market cap of $3.3 billion. An accounting error that paid executives too much didn't help. Only 14 analysts tracked by FactSet still cover the stockand 70% of them rate it at Hold or the equivalent.Dillard's, with a market cap of $6.4 billion, actually has a stronger punch. True, only four analysts track the stock and not one is bullish on it. But the stock has defied the naysayers, hitting all-time highs earlier this year. The company's one-two combo of cost discipline and focus on higher-margin categories is allowing it to deliver a string of better-than-expected results.Kohl's is sometimes counted as department-store stock. However, the company has always favored off-mall locations. For a time, that strategy, along with partnering with Amazon.com to accept its returns, allowed it to outperform other department stores.In the past year, though, stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value — hurt by the firing of its CEO and disappointing results. The company lost a chance to be acquired for more than $60 a share in 2022, and now changes hands for $8.Life for department stores is rough — and has been for the past decade. Maybe even longer. The American shopper wants to buy online and get rock-bottom prices, which explains the rise of the discounter.Even catering to the well-to-to hasn't shielded those great retailers, as evidenced by companies like Neiman Marcus and Henri Bendel.So Macy's and Dillard's are left to go it alone. Nordstrom keep getting jabbed at by shifting tastes and tariffs and online stores — both here and abroad — but at the least it won't have to share the details of that fight every quarter.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

A spokesperson declined to provide additional details about which divisions within devices and services were impacted.“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,"" said the spokesperson.

The decline can be attributed to challenging macroeconomic conditions, moderating cloud growth, higher investments in developing cloud infrastructure and increasing regulatory headwinds.GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online this year, cloud revenues are expected to witness increased variability. The company expects to invest roughly $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, which is aimed at building up technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. Alphabet expects advertising revenue growth to be lower due to a challenging year-over-year comparison. The company enjoyed solid growth in the financial services vertical in 2024.Regulatory headwinds like the lawsuit between the Department of Justice (DOJ) and GOOGL over Google Search are a concern. The DOJ argues that Google has inked anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine and plans to break up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android. DOJ’s proposal doesn’t bode well for Alphabet, given growing competition from AI-powered products like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity and Meta AI.Nevertheless, Alphabet’s focus on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud, driving top-line growth. Will AI focus drive Alphabet’s prospects this year? Let’s dig deep to find out.GOOGL Stock’s Performance  GOOGL’s Enhanced AI Usage to Aid ProspectsAt its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, GOOGL unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), expected to be available later this year. Google Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network (Cloud WAN), giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet showcased Willow, its new quantum chip, while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.Alphabet’s initiatives to infuse AI in Search are noteworthy. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Circle to Search was available on 250 million devices, with usage increasing roughly 40% during the quarter. Since October 2024, monthly visual searches with lens have increased by 5 billion. AI Overview is currently used by more than 1.5 billion people monthly. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview’s advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.In Cloud, Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and a low-code tool offering Agent Designer.Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination offers security offerings that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently. Wiz has a stellar clientele with its cloud security platform currently used by Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Oracle. The Wiz buyout reflects the growing importance of Google Cloud in the company’s growth plans. The addition of Wiz to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing space. Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the first quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 22% and Google Cloud at 12%.Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Upward Trend for GOOGLThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $2.12 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 30 days, indicating 12.17% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.43 per share, up 7% over the past 30 days, suggesting 17.29% year-over-year growth.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteAlphabet’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.64%.GOOGL Stock is OvervaluedThe Value Score of C suggests a stretched valuation for Alphabet at this moment.Alphabet stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.74X compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry’s 4.8X.Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)GOOGL shares are trading below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.GOOGL Shares Trade Below 50-Day & 200-Day SMAs  ConclusionAlphabet’s growing GenAI capabilities and significant investments in cloud computing present a potential catalyst for the future amid stiff competition in the cloud space and increasing regulatory headwinds. GOOGL’s dominant position in the search engine market and strong position in the cloud are long-term drivers.Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Aramco says has US tie-ups worth up to $90 billion amid Trump Gulf tour,1747238890000,"Saudi Aramco TADAWUL:2222 said on Wednesday it had signed 34 preliminary deals with major U.S. companies, potentially worth up to $90 billion in a push to deepen commercial ties with the United States on the back of President Donald Trump's visit to the kingdom. The announcement was made a day after Riyadh pledged $600 billion in U.S. investments. Still, most tie-ups listed by the state oil giant were memorandums of understanding without a value attached. Some deals have also been previously announced, such as the agreement to buy 1.2 million tonnes of LNG per year for a 20-year term from NextDecade NASDAQ:NEXT . The agreements underscore Saudi Arabia’s efforts to strengthen its energy partnerships and attract foreign investment as it looks to balance oil dominance with broader industrial and technological growth under Vision 2030. ""The U.S. is really a good place to put our investment,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on Tuesday at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh. The forum coincided with Trump's four-day tour of the Gulf, marked by lavish receptions and a series of business deals, including $142 billion in arms agreements.Aramco is the economic backbone of Saudi Arabia, generating a bulk of the kingdom's revenue through oil exports and funding its ambitious Vision 2030 diversification drive. Its shares have fallen almost 9% this year. FLURRY OF SIGNINGS The company said the agreements, struck through its Aramco Group Companies, aim to build on its longstanding ties with U.S. companies, enhance shareholder value, and expand collaboration in energy and other strategic sectors.A memorandum of understanding with tech heavyweight Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA aims to establish advanced industrial AI infrastructure, including an AI Hub, an engineering and robotics centre, and workforce training programmes.Aramco also signed an MoU with ExxonMobil NYSE:XOM to evaluate a significant upgrade to their SAMREF refinery, with plans to expand it into an integrated petrochemical complex.It also inked a non-binding agreement with Amazon Web Services NASDAQ:AMZN to collaborate on digital transformation and lower-carbon initiatives, while an MoU with Qualcomm NASDAQ:QCOM focuses on collaboration in enhancing industrial networks and AI capabilities.""Our U.S.-related activities have evolved over the decades, and now include multi-disciplinary R&D, the Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, start-up investments, potential collaborations in LNG, and ongoing procurement,"" Nasser said in a statement. Aramco said on Tuesday it would invest $3.4 billion to expand the Motiva refinery in Texas. Beyond energy, the state oil giant has become a key vehicle for industrial development, digital transformation, and foreign investment.It expanded existing relationships with several high-profile U.S. suppliers including SLB NYSE:SLB , Baker Hughes NASDAQ:BKR , GE Vernova NYSE:GEV and Honeywell NASDAQ:HON . On the financial services front, it has forged agreements with asset management giants PIMCO, State Street Corporation and Wellington.It also signed a deal for short-term cash investments through a unified investment fund, named 'Fund of One', with financial heavyweights BlackRock NYSE:BLK , Goldman Sachs NYSE:GS , Morgan Stanley NYSE:MS and PIMCO.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM0T6:0-aramco-says-has-us-tie-ups-worth-up-to-90-billion-amid-trump-gulf-tour/"
Amazon vs. Oracle: Which Cloud Computing Stock is a Better Bet?,1747834920000,"In the high-stakes world of cloud computing, Amazon.com AMZN and Oracle ORCL represent contrasting approaches to capturing the explosive growth in artificial intelligence and enterprise computing. Amazon, with its dominant Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud platform, continues to leverage its first-mover advantage and massive scale, while Oracle positions itself as a specialized provider of database and enterprise applications with growing cloud ambitions through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.Both tech giants have made significant investments in AI infrastructure and services, attempting to capitalize on the transformative technology that's reshaping industries worldwide. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for AMZN StockAmazon's cloud division, AWS, delivered impressive first-quarter 2025 results with revenues climbing 17% year over year to $29.3 billion, establishing an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. This robust performance demonstrates AWS' continued market leadership despite increasing competition. Amazon's aggressive expansion of AI capabilities, including the deployment of next-generation P6-B200 instances powered by NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, positions the company at the forefront of the AI revolution.The company's retail business also shows remarkable resilience with record delivery speeds and strong consumer engagement. Amazon has successfully regionalized its fulfillment network, resulting in faster deliveries and lower costs. According to CEO Andy Jassy, everyday essentials grew twice as fast as the rest of the business and represented one out of every three units sold in the United States.Amazon's strategic investments extend beyond domestic markets. The company recently announced a $5+ billion partnership with Saudi Arabia's HUMAIN to build a groundbreaking ""AI Zone,"" demonstrating its global ambitions. Additionally, Amazon has rapidly expanded its AI model offerings in Bedrock, incorporating leading models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek, creating a comprehensive AI ecosystem for developers and enterprises.The company's financial health is equally impressive, with first-quarter operating income growing 20% year over year to $18.4 billion. Amazon beat Wall Street expectations with EPS of $1.59, exceeding forecasts by 23 cents. The company's diversified revenue streams, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and subscription services, provide multiple growth vectors and natural hedges against market volatility.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 net sales is pegged at $693.74 billion, indicating growth of 8.74% from the prior-year reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.3 per share, which indicates a jump of 13.92% from the year-ago period.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for ORCL StockOracle's recent performance has failed to impress investors, with third-quarter 2025 results falling short of expectations. Revenues reached $14.13 billion, growing just 6.40% year over year but missing projections by $259.18 million. Similarly, EPS of $1.47 missed estimates by 2 cents, reflecting execution challenges in a highly competitive market.While Oracle touts its cloud growth, the reality remains that its total cloud revenues of $6.2 billion are dwarfed by AWS' $29.3 billion quarterly revenues. Oracle's infrastructure scale limitations are evident as the company struggles to meet demand, with executives repeatedly citing ""capacity constraints"" as hurdles to faster growth. Despite adding its 101st cloud region, Oracle lacks the global reach and availability zones that Amazon offers.The company's strategic focus appears scattered across multiple fronts — healthcare partnerships, financial services products, and government initiatives — without the coherent vision that Amazon demonstrates. Oracle's heavy reliance on its database business makes it vulnerable to cloud-native alternatives and multi-cloud strategies that bypass Oracle's traditionally high-margin offerings.Though Oracle highlights its Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) growing 63% to $130 billion, skepticism exists around conversion rates and timing. The company's guidance for 15% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 seems ambitious given its consistent execution issues and history of overpromising. Oracle's AI strategy centers around its database offerings rather than providing the comprehensive AI ecosystem that AWS delivers.The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.03 per share, down 0.3% over the past 60 days.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteDespite management's claims about cost advantages for AI workloads, Oracle lacks the semiconductor investments and specialized infrastructure that Amazon has built. The company's relatively modest $16 billion annual CapEx pales in comparison to Amazon's infrastructure investments, raising questions about Oracle's ability to compete at scale in the capital-intensive cloud and AI markets.Stock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonBoth companies trade at premium valuations, but Amazon offers superior value considering its growth prospects. Amazon's forward P/E of approximately 30.66x is justified by its diversified revenue streams, market leadership in multiple high-growth sectors, and consistent ability to exceed earnings expectations. Oracle's forward P/E of 24.2x appears superficially cheaper but represents a questionable value given its slower growth and execution challenges.AMZN vs. ORCL: P/E F12M RatioAmazon's recent price performance reflects investor confidence, with shares climbing 3.5% year in the past 6-month period, outperforming Oracle which declined 16.6%. Oracle's relative valuation discount reflects legitimate concerns about its competitive position and ability to capitalize on the AI revolution at scale.AMZN Outperforms ORCL in the Past 6-Month PeriodAmazon's enterprise value to free cash flow ratio provides a more compelling investment case, especially considering the company's proven ability to reinvest cash flows into high-return initiatives. While both companies offer cloud exposure, Amazon's diversification and scale provide a significantly more attractive risk-adjusted return profile than Oracle's narrower focus and smaller operational footprint.ConclusionAmazon emerges as the decidedly stronger investment opportunity in the cloud and AI race. Its superior scale, comprehensive AI capabilities, diversified revenue streams, and consistent execution provide a compelling foundation for long-term growth. While Oracle attempts to position itself as a specialized alternative, its smaller scale, execution missteps, and fragmented strategy make it a distant second in the cloud wars. Investors seeking exposure to the transformative potential of cloud computing and artificial intelligence would be better served by adding Amazon shares to their portfolios while reducing or avoiding Oracle positions. Amazon's demonstrated ability to continuously reinvent itself and its leadership position in multiple high-growth markets give it unmatched potential for sustained outperformance. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), whereas ORCL has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c981bb8e7094b:0-amazon-vs-oracle-which-cloud-computing-stock-is-a-better-bet/

"Should You Buy, Sell or Hold JD.com Stock After Q1 Earnings Beat?",1747234800000,"JD.com JD, the supply chain-based e-commerce giant in China, reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2025 results. Its revenues in the quarter increased 15.8% year over year to RMB 301.1 billion ($41.5 billion), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%. The company reported non-GAAP diluted net income per share of RMB 8.41 ($1.16), which rose 48.8% year over year. The figure beat the consensus estimate by 10.48%. The solid performance can be attributed to improving consumer sentiment and continued enhancements in JD’s supply chain capabilities and user experience. The company’s strategic involvement in AI and robotics positions it for long-term growth. However, despite the long-term growth prospects, JD is facing several near-term headwinds, which should caution investors. Let’s take a closer look at the factors affecting the company to understand why investors should consider avoiding the stock till clearer recovery indicators emerge.JD Faces Pressures in the New Business SegmentJD’s new business segment posted a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB 1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025, despite an 18% year-over-year revenue increase. The loss was mainly driven by the aggressive expansion of its food delivery business, which is still in its early stages and failed to make a meaningful contribution to financial performance during the quarter.The food delivery initiative, although showing user traction, remains a drag on profitability. With operations only beginning to scale at the end of the first quarter, JD incurred significant costs without a corresponding revenue impact. The company remains in the early phase of developing its food delivery operations, with continued system improvements required to enhance both user experience and operational efficiency.JD’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.59 per share, which has been revised downward by 3.16% over the past 30 days, indicating 7.75% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for 2025 revenues is pegged at $172.07 billion, suggesting 7.04% year-over-year growth.JD.com’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 25.23%.JD.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusJD.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | JD.com, Inc. QuoteJD Operates in an Intensely Competitive MarketThe online retail industry in China is intensely competitive. JD.com’s current competitors in China include Alibaba BABA and PDD Holdings Inc. Sponsored ADR PDD. Globally, JD.com faces intense competition from the e-commerce behemoth Amazon AMZN. Alibaba commands roughly 80% of China’s e-commerce market, while PDD Holdings Inc. attracts consumers with aggressive discounts and group-buying offers. Amazon remains highly competitive in retail through its unbeatable pricing, wide selection, and convenience.Tough competition can hurt JD by reducing its profit margins, shrinking its market share, weakening its brand, or even causing big losses. When setting prices, the company has to look at what competitors are charging for similar products. If rivals lower their prices or offer extra perks, the company may have to do the same to stay competitive. Otherwise, it risks losing customers, which could hurt its business and financial performance.Some of JD’s current competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customer bases and higher penetration in the market, which poses a major threat to the company.JD Stock Price Performance and ValuationJD shares have returned 7.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s growth of 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The stock has also outperformed the S&P 500 index’s decline of 0.5% in the same time frame.However, JD has underperformed its industry peers, BABA and PDD. Shares of BABA and PDD have gained 55.3% and 23.2%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. Shares of AMZN have lost 3.6% in the same time frame. JD.com’s YTD Price Return PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, JD currently trades at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 7.94X, which is well below the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry’s 22.94X. This suggests that investors may be paying a lower price relative to the company's expected earnings growth.JD’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationConclusionJD.com delivered a strong first-quarter performance, but near-term prospects seem murky. Losses in its new business segment, particularly food delivery, and aggressive investments in AI, automation, and logistics are weighing on near-term profitability. The company’s latest move, launching an international all-cargo air route between Wuhu, China and Hanoi, Vietnam, adds to JD’s capital expenditure without offering near-term contribution. With earnings estimates trending downward and intensifying market competition, investors should consider exiting positions. Until clearer signs of recovery emerge, JD.com is best avoided.JD currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e42627330094b:0-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-jd-com-stock-after-q1-earnings-beat/

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Trump's trip shows Saudi Arabia getting the best Nvidia next generation chips with a red carpet rollout from prominent names in tech including Elon Musk, Jensen Huang and Andy Jassy. China, however, is dealing with restrictions and blockades from Nvidia's older H20 chip, slowing down the AI buildout in Beijing.

UiPath Shares Down 37% Over a Year: Is a Turnaround in Play?,1747761000000,"UiPath Inc. PATH has experienced a challenging year, with its stock sliding 37%, significantly underperforming its industry’s 21% growth. However, the tide may be turning. Over the past month, PATH has rebounded 23%, hinting at a potential recovery.This analysis will dive into the company’s recent performance and explore whether current market conditions and price levels present a compelling buying opportunity for investors looking for long-term value.PATH Thrives in the Automation Market GrowthUiPath remains a strong force in the booming Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is poised for substantial expansion over the coming years. Its end-to-end automation platform positions the company to seize opportunities as demand for AI-driven solutions surges.A critical driver of PATH’s success is its strategic alliances with top technology giants. Microsoft MSFT, Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, and Salesforce CRM continue to play pivotal roles in expanding UiPath’s reach and capabilities. These partnerships not only bolster PATH’s credibility but also integrate its offerings into broader enterprise ecosystems powered by Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Salesforce Cloud solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath reported a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $424 million. Meanwhile, annual recurring revenue climbed to $1.67 billion, up 14% from the prior year, underscoring the effectiveness of its subscription model and strong client loyalty. Through collaboration with innovators like Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce, PATH is well-positioned to thrive in a competitive and fast-evolving automation landscape.PATH's Strong Financial PositionPATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal fourth quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH’s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.Additionally, the company’s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 2.93, exceeding the industry average of 2.38. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company’s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.Mixed Analyst Sentiment for PATH Indicates UncertaintyOver the past 60 days, PATH has seen mixed revisions in analyst estimates. Two analysts downgraded their projections for fiscal 2026, and one revised fiscal 2027 estimates downward, suggesting growing concerns about mid-term growth or profitability. Meanwhile, only one analyst upgraded their fiscal 2027 estimate, and none revised 2026 estimates upward. This revision imbalance implies a cautious outlook, with more analysts losing confidence than gaining it.Hold Recommendation for UiPathPATH is showing encouraging signs of a rebound after a difficult stretch, benefiting from its position in the expanding automation market. Its strategic alliances with major tech players continue to enhance its platform’s reach and relevance in enterprise ecosystems. Strong client loyalty and a resilient business model highlight its potential to thrive long term. However, recent cautious revisions in analyst estimates point to growth, visibility, and profitability concerns.While the company's financial position remains solid and supports innovation, the imbalance in sentiment suggests uncertainty about near-term acceleration. Investors may find it wise to hold their positions rather than making new aggressive moves. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase, and waiting for more clarity on sustained growth and market direction could offer better entry or exit points. PATH remains promising, but a patient, watchful approach is most suitable.PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Trump Trip Puts Saudi Arabia On AI Map — Market Talk,1747231020000,"President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia Tuesday ""was a bullish eye-opener for investors in US tech stocks,"" according to Wedbush. The analysts say Saudi Arabia is clearly the next major area of penetration for the artificial intelligence revolution. Joining Trump on his trip to the Middle East were notable names including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Elon Musk and Amazon's Andy Jassy, among others, say the analysts. ""The AI revolution is coming to the Saudi Kingdom and Riyadh will be a major buyer of AI chips, software, autonomous/robotics and data centers over the next decade,"" Wedbush says. The analysts think the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, ""and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view,"" they say.

C3.ai Trading at a Premium at 6.39X: Time to Hold or Sell the Stock?,1747760040000,"C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector’s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai’s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai’s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let’s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai’s TailwindsC3.ai’s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon ’s AMZN AWS, Alphabet ’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft ’s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company’s integration into Microsoft’s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company’s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai’s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What’s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai’s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai’s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels. C3.ai currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:97dfa7506094b:0-c3-ai-trading-at-a-premium-at-6-39x-time-to-hold-or-sell-the-stock/

Criteo Stock Plunges 29% YTD: Should You Buy the Dip or Wait?,1747753140000,"Criteo CRTO shares have lost 29.2% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 1.4% and the S&P 500 index’s return of 0.7%. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry’s growth of 17.2% in the same time frame.The stock’s underperformance can be attributed to the effect of tariffs and inflation surrounding the industry. Criteo, although showing a dip at the moment, is poised for long-term growth even amid the macroeconomic uncertainties. The company is taking strategic steps to drive its prospects. Let’s take a closer look at how CRTO is laying the foundation for sustained growth.Strategic Shifts to Reinforce Retail Media and MonetizationCriteo has been transitioning from its legacy retargeting business toward high-growth areas, such as Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, Retail Media on-platform revenues grew 21% year over year, driven by increased advertiser and retailer demand. Off-platform monetization also grew, supported by a 60% increase in supply partners. This can be attributed to the company’s work with retailers like Michaels, Dollar Tree and Meijer, and its expansion of on-site monetization and self-service platforms.Commerce Audiences is another area of focus, with more than 250 brands onboarded to its expanded platform to date. With more first-party data integrations and growing demand for performance-based upper-funnel targeting, this business is positioned to scale throughout 2025.Criteo S.A. Price and ConsensusCriteo S.A. price-consensus-chart | Criteo S.A. QuoteCriteo’s Competition and How CRTO Stands OutCriteo operates in a crowded space, competing with tech giants like Amazon AMZN, Google GOOGL, and The Trade Desk TTD. Amazon uses its shopper data to sell ads directly on its platform, while The Trade Desk helps brands buy ads across the open Internet with data-driven tools. Google rivals Criteo with ads across Search, YouTube and websites, using its vast user data. Shares of Amazon, Google and The Trade Desk have lost 6%, 12.1% and 35.1%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. While these players dominate in various channels, Criteo differentiates itself by providing retailer-direct access and a transparent, demand-driven platform that aligns with first-party data needs. With its broad retail network, proprietary Shopper Graph, and AI-based performance engine, Criteo offers measurable returns to brands and retailers, an advantage it plans to expand upon through continued platform investment and innovation.CRTO’s Earnings Estimate Revisions Show Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CRTO’s 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $3.46 per share, which has been revised upward by 8.46% over the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 16.98%. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.15 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.41%.CRTO beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 45.42%.Here’s Why You Should Buy CRTO Stock NowCriteo is now focusing on high-growth areas like Retail Media and Commerce Audiences. In the first quarter of 2025, the company expanded its advertiser base by 11% year over year and drove strong platform adoption across key retailers like Michaels and Meijer. New features such as dynamic sponsored products and video ads have strengthened its product suite, while recent wins in categories like grocery and home improvement reflect growing market traction. With more than 250 brands using Commerce Audiences and self-service adoption rising, Criteo is building momentum. Backed by a clear product roadmap, the company is positioning itself for long-term success.CRTO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Growth Score of A, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

Top Health & Fitness Stocks to Buy for the Wellness Boom,1747227420000,"An updated edition of the March 24, 2025 article.The health and fitness space has transformed into a thriving industry, fueled by growing public interest in leading healthier lives. More people are prioritizing wellness, pushing up demand for gyms, supplements, and holistic services. Tech has played a big role here — wearable devices and digital platforms have made it easier than ever to monitor progress and stay motivated. At the same time, rising concerns around obesity, chronic illness, and mental health are prompting even more individuals to adopt fitness-focused lifestyles.Tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN are leaning into this shift. Apple’s ecosystem includes the Apple Watch and its Fitness+ service, offering users real-time health data and guided workouts. Amazon is also making moves in healthcare with acquisitions like One Medical, combining artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools with virtual care. These efforts are reshaping how people manage their health, and in turn, accelerating industry growth.Looking ahead, the global health and wellness market is expected to hit around $1.1 trillion by 2034, at a steady 7.33% CAGR from 2025. Emphasis on preventive care, alongside corporate wellness programs and government-backed initiatives, is keeping the momentum strong. The rise of boutique fitness and premium wellness clubs is also opening the door for more specialized offerings. Consumers are shifting toward a more integrated view of health — where fitness, nutrition, and mental well-being go hand in hand — creating multiple revenue streams for brands in the space. Companies like Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, Hims & Hers Health HIMS and DexCom DXCM are the leading players in this movement.For investors, this trend presents a compelling long-term opportunity. As wellness becomes a top priority for more consumers, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health services is expected to grow. Our Health & Fitness Screen is designed to put the spotlight on high-potential stocks — like the four above — making it easier to find strong opportunities in this expanding market.Ready to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas? Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and discover your next big opportunity.3 Health & Fitness Stocks to Buy NowSprouts Farmers Market has carved out a strong niche in the specialty grocery space, putting fresh, natural, and organic products front and center. Its store design revolves around an open-market concept, where produce takes the spotlight. Surrounding it is a handpicked assortment of organic, plant-based, and gluten-free goods tailored to health-conscious shoppers. From fresh meats and dairy alternatives to vitamins and supplements, Sprouts offers lifestyle-focused choices. Its private-label Sprouts Brand has gained serious traction — generating over 23% of revenue in 2024 — by delivering exclusive, high-quality items at value-driven prices.Now operating 440 stores across 24 states, Sprouts continues to expand with a focus on smaller-format locations that bring fresh, premium food closer to communities. A key part of its strategy lies in logistics: the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is optimizing its supply chain by placing distribution hubs within 250 miles of most stores. This boosts produce freshness and supports local sourcing. At the same time, Sprouts is leaning into digital innovation with app-based ordering, delivery options, and personalized marketing, all contributing to a seamless omnichannel shopping experience.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sustainability is more than a buzzword for Sprouts — it’s woven into the company’s mission. In 2024, organic products made up 30% of total sales, while plant-based offerings climbed 27%. The company continues to prioritize responsible sourcing, food waste reduction, and carbon footprint management. Through its Sprouts Healthy Communities Foundation, over $35 million has been invested since 2015 in nutrition education and food access programs. By combining eco-conscious practices with a commitment to health and wellness, Sprouts is reinforcing its role as a go-to grocer for mindful consumers. Hims & Hers Health has steadily evolved into a broad-based digital health and wellness platform, offering personalized solutions for conditions like hair loss, mental health, dermatology, weight loss, and sexual wellness. Their services are primarily delivered via telehealth, where customers access licensed providers through the company’s platform. These providers prescribe medications—both branded and compounded — which are fulfilled through Hims & Hers-affiliated pharmacies. In addition to prescription products, the company also offers over-the-counter health, skincare, and supplement items, many under their own brand, available online or through retail partnerships.Hims & Hers’ fitness and wellness offerings have expanded significantly in recent years, with notable moves into weight management. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company launched compounded semaglutide in mid-2024 and later added branded versions, tying into its broader telehealth weight loss program. New capabilities like a peptide manufacturing facility and a lab testing business (acquired in early 2025) aim to support long-term growth in this segment. These additions enhance their ability to provide medically-backed, personalized treatments for conditions such as obesity, testosterone imbalance, and sleep disorders — areas often tied to physical fitness and overall well-being.Underlying this expansion is a scalable tech platform that supports recurring subscription models and end-to-end care, from virtual consultation to medication delivery. Their approach reduces barriers like stigma and access limitations, particularly for first-time healthcare seekers. The platform’s structure allows Hims & Hers to respond quickly to growing demand for lifestyle-related care, positioning the company as a consumer-first health partner with a strong foothold in the digital fitness and wellness space.DexCom ’s health and fitness-related business centers around continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems designed to support people managing diabetes and those focused on improving metabolic health. Its core products — G6, G7, and the newly launched Stelo biosensor — offer real-time glucose tracking, mobile connectivity, and seamless data sharing via wearables like Apple Watch. The G7 system, with a smaller sensor and faster warm-up time, offers advanced alerts and an intuitive mobile app, while the over-the-counter Stelo targets adults with prediabetes and non-insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, broadening Dexcom’s reach into wellness and preventive care.Over the years, Dexcom has expanded beyond insulin-dependent users through strategic product development and partnerships. Its CGM systems are now integrated with insulin pumps and smart pens, allowing for semi-automated insulin delivery. More recently, Dexcom has collaborated with digital health players and consumer technology brands to make CGM data available in fitness platforms, extending usage beyond clinical diabetes management. These efforts are aligned with Dexcom’s broader vision of helping a wider population manage glucose levels and gain insights into their metabolic health.Dexcom’s platform continues to evolve, with development aimed at people who are obese, pregnant, or hospitalized. Their CGM systems are built for continuous use, replacing traditional finger-stick methods and offering wearable comfort and connectivity. Dexcom’s real-time APIs allow developers to integrate glucose data into various health and fitness applications. Through its advanced biosensors, predictive alerts, and growing focus on general health, #2 Ranked Dexcom is positioning itself as not just a diabetes tech leader but also a key player in the evolving health and fitness ecosystem.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cb7e459f2094b:0-top-health-fitness-stocks-to-buy-for-the-wellness-boom/

GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or SoundHound AI, Offers Better Gains?NVIDIA Corp. and SoundHound AI, Inc . have made significant inroads in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, boosting their stock prices over the last year. Both are targeting distinct AI segments, so let’s determine the one with greater gains.The Bullish Case for SOUN StockThe temporary trade agreement between the United States and China is good news for SoundHound AI stock. Tariffs on Chinese imports are lowered to 30% from 145%, and China has reduced the import duty on American commodities to 10% from 125%. The 90-day truce benefited companies with trade in the United States and China.Thanks to the deal with Tencent, SoundHound AI now operates in China. Tencent will integrate SoundHound’s voice AI into its cloud solutions for the automotive sector. As a software company, SoundHound AI may not be directly affected by tariffs; however, its cost of doing business rises significantly. Moreover, if tensions escalate, SoundHound AI may be blacklisted by China, impacting its partnership with Tencent.As more enterprise customers use SoundHound AI’s platforms, the company’s first-quarter 2025 revenues jumped 151% year over year to $29.1 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) loss in the first quarter narrowed by 14%. The company finished the quarter with positive cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt. For full-year 2025, the company aims for 85% to 90% revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA.The Bullish Case for NVDA StockNVIDIA is poised to gain from the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. and Alphabet Inc. These cloud computing companies are acquiring NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to boost computing power for AI workloads. Alphabet, in particular, said that growth from its AI products in the latest reported quarter was much higher than that of Google Cloud.By 2028, NVIDIA forecasts AI data center spending to hit $1 trillion, fueling stock growth. NVIDIA’s advanced chips are also in high demand, with shipments of its latest cutting-edge new-generation Blackwell chips surging by the day due to their faster AI interface and improved energy efficiency. Additionally, the popularity of the CUDA software platform has increased among developers and is expected to improve NVIDIA’s quarterly performance (read more: Can Palantir Stock be the Next NVIDIA, and Is It Worth Buying?).NVIDIA or SoundHound AI: Which Stock Has Greater Gain Potential?No doubt, the latest trade deal and widespread adoption of SoundHound’s voice-enabled AI systems are positives for the stock. However, the company is simply growing through acquisitions and less organically. If diverse corporate cultures don’t seamlessly blend, then it can be a hindrance to SoundHound AI’s growth story.SoundHound AI isn’t profitable yet and has often failed to meet its guidance, impacting the stock’s growth. Despite issuing positive EBITDA guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company’s adjusted EBITDA remained a negative $22.2 million five quarters later. On the other hand, NVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than the Semiconductor - General industry, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, higher than the industry’s 49.5%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has more room to scale upward.Furthermore, SoundHound AI lacks a competitive edge like NVIDIA has with GPUs. NVIDIA’s more than 80% market share in the GPU space will help the stock sustain market volatility, which could pose challenges for SoundHound AI. This indicates, NVIDIA can offer better and consistent gains in the near future. For now, both NVIDIA and SoundHound AI have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights C3.ai, UiPath, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",1747225740000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 14, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: C3.ai, Inc. AI, UiPath Inc. PATH, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:C3.ai or UiPath: Which AI Automation Stock Is the Better Buy Right Now?C3.ai, Inc. and UiPath Inc . are both high-profile players in the booming AI automation sector. C3.ai specializes in enterprise AI applications, including predictive maintenance and generative AI tools, while UiPath leads in robotic process automation and is evolving toward “agentic AI” solutions. Both companies have seen recent momentum amid the broader artificial intelligence hype. In 2025, each presents a distinct case: C3.ai is smaller but growing faster, whereas UiPath is larger with more stable financials.These companies stand at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing trends—AI and digital transformation—making them compelling candidates for investors eyeing long-term technology disruption. Recent volatility in both stocks, coupled with evolving enterprise spending patterns and new product developments, has reignited interest in evaluating their investment potential. With macroeconomic uncertainty pressuring tech valuations and AI narratives driving short-term sentiment, now is an opportune time to assess which stock holds more promise.Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is the better investment at present.The Case for C3.ai StockC3.ai markets itself as an enterprise AI pure play, offering a suite of prebuilt, configurable AI applications that help large organizations implement predictive analytics, detect anomalies, and optimize operations. In theory, this makes its platform highly scalable across sectors. C3.ai has positioned itself as a pure-play enterprise AI software company, offering a broad portfolio of over 100 pre-built AI applications across various industries, including energy, manufacturing, and financial services. Central to the company’s growth strategy is its deepening alignment with major cloud providers and government institutions, designed to accelerate go-to-market efforts and extend distribution scale.C3.ai’s strengths center on its leadership in enterprise AI. The company claims first-mover status in “model-driven” AI applications, having expanded across numerous industries (19 in total) and the U.S. federal government, where federal revenues grew more than 100% in fiscal 2024. The company has secured large customers and pilots — recent announced deals include oil & gas supermajors, the U.S. Navy, BASF and multiple state/local governments. Strategic partnerships bolster C3.ai’s reach.For example, C3.ai is the most sought-after AI application on Microsoft ’s Azure cloud marketplace. It has a tie-up with Alphabet ’s Google Cloud and Amazon ’s Amazon Web Services. Since announcing an expanded alliance with Microsoft in late 2024, C3.ai closed 28 new deals through joint engagements, spanning nine industries. Sales cycles withMicrosoft have shortened by approximately 20%, a testament to the strength of their joint go-to-market motions. As of the fiscal third-quarter end, C3.ai and Microsoft were engaged in more than 600 active enterprise opportunities globally. These factors suggest that there will be continued opportunities as companies seek AI tools to streamline processes and decision-making.In its fiscal third-quarter results, C3.ai reported total revenues of $98.8 million, marking a 26% increase year over year. Subscription revenues grew 22% year over year to $85.7 million, constituting 87% of total revenues. The company closed 66 agreements, including 50 pilots, a 72% increase year over year.C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non GAAP loss of 12 cents per share). The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.Although cash reserves are large ($724.3 million at the fiscal third-quarter end), continued losses raise the risk of dilution or spending pressure. Competition is fierce – from other AI startups to tech giants building in-house AI solutions, which could pressure C3.ai’s growth or pricing. Growth also appears to be moderating after a surge in activity. Revenue growth rate decreased from 29% in the fiscal second quarter to 26% in the fiscal third quarter.The Case for UiPath StockUiPath operates in the adjacent, yet distinct, space of robotic process automation. Its platform automates rule-based, repetitive digital tasks—freeing up human workers and reducing costs for businesses. In contrast to C3.ai’s focus on predictive analytics and machine learning, UiPath emphasizes process optimization, task mining, and digital workflow orchestration. This has enabled it to gain broad adoption across banking, insurance, healthcare, and public sector clients.UiPath’s strengths lie in its market leadership and innovation. UiPath has a large global customer base and high retention (net retention approximately 110–115%), meaning existing accounts keep expanding. Management notes that 90% of surveyed enterprises see opportunities for agentic AI in their workflows, suggesting a large addressable market ahead. Furthermore, UiPath enjoys very high gross margins (85% non-GAAP in the fiscal fourth quarter) and has been streamlining its cost structure, supporting improved profitability.UiPath’s business and financial profile contrast sharply with C3.ai’s. UiPath is much larger and has recently been moving toward profitability. In fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31, 2025), UiPath reported revenues of $1.43 billion, up 9% year over year. In the fiscal fourth quarter (October 2024–January 2025), revenues were $424 million (up 5%). Its subscription and recurring model yields stable bookings — year-end Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $1.666 billion (up 14%).Crucially, UiPath generated a GAAP operating profit of $34 million in the fiscal fourth quarter (versus a year-ago loss) and $241 million of non-GAAP operating income for the full year. Free cash flow was robust, reaching $328 million in fiscal 2025. The company ended the year with about $1.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet and launched a $500 million share buyback program, announced during the fiscal second quarter. These figures point to a healthy, cash-generative model, despite modest growth.On the other hand, UiPath faces challenges. Its revenue growth rate has slowed to mid-single digits (10% in the fiscal second quarter, 9% in the fiscal third quarter, 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter) as large enterprises moderate spending. Global economic uncertainty — especially in the U.S. public sector — has pressured guidance. Competition is fierce: Microsoft (Power Automate), Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, and even open-source tools vie for the automation market. UiPath remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis for the year (fiscal 2025 GAAP operating loss was $163 million), though it expects to sustain profitability going forward.Share Price Performance & Valuations for C3.ai, UiPath StocksPATH (up 3%) has performed better than AI (down 29.7%) so far in 2025. Over the past month, PATH has gained 22.2%, more than AI’s 20.6% rally.ValuationC3.ai is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7X, below its three-year median of 8.33X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 5.74X. PATH’s forward earnings multiple sits at 4.63X, below its three-year median of 6.41X. The C3.ai stock appears expensive when compared with the sector average and PATH.While both companies operate in the AI automation space, UiPath's valuation metrics suggest a more balanced investment profile, with expectations of future profitability and valuations in line with industry norms. C3.ai carries a higher valuation premium and lacks current profitability, which may present greater investment risk.Comparing EPS Projections: C3.ai & UiPathThe 2025 EPS estimates have trended upward over the past 60 days for PATH stock while the same remained unchanged for C3.ai. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for C3.ai’s 2025 bottom line suggests a 4.3% improvement, while that for PATH indicates a year-over-year decline of 1.9%.ConclusionBoth C3.ai and UiPath are positioned to benefit from the continued interest in AI-driven automation, but their risk/reward profiles differ. C3.ai offers higher growth potential, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicating 29.7% revenue growth in fiscal 2025, and first-mover advantages in the enterprise AI market. However, it is still unprofitable, burning cash. In contrast, UiPath is larger and almost cash-flow positive. It generates profits on a non-GAAP basis, boasts a strong balance sheet, and recently returned capital via a $500 million buyback.In a nutshell, C3.ai’s upside depends on sustaining rapid growth and successfully scaling new AI offerings, which is far from certain, given competition and macro risks. UiPath, while growing more slowly, has a more proven business model and valuation that is easier to justify. UiPath — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company - appears to offer better upside potential in 2025.Its combination of profitability, strong cash flow, and reasonable valuation makes it more resilient if growth disappoints. C3.ai — a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company — could outperform on strong AI tailwinds, but it is riskier and richly priced.

Stocks Inch Higher Pre-Bell as Traders Parse Inflation Data; Trump Repeats Call for Rate Cuts,1747222190000,"The main US stock measures edged up in Wednesday's premarket activity as investors digest the latest consumer price inflation report, while President Donald Trump again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were slightly in the green before the opening bell, while the Nasdaq increased 0.1%. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finished the previous trading session higher, while the Dow closed in the red. Government data on Tuesday showed that consumer prices in the world's largest economy rebounded last month, but missed Wall Street's estimates, while annual inflation eased to the lowest level since February 2021. ""There isn't a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the (consumer price index) in April, but this shouldn't be surprising as it takes time,"" Oxford Economics said Tuesday in remarks emailed to MT Newswires. The US and China recently reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties. The two countries had been in a trade war since Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The producer price index and the retail sales report, both for April, are out on Thursday. Wednesday's economic calendar has the weekly mortgage applications bulletin at 7 am ET, followed by the weekly EIA domestic petroleum inventories report. In a social media post late Tuesday, Trump repeated his call for the Fed to cut interest rates, saying there was no inflation and prices of gas, energy and groceries are down. Last week, the Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged and warned that upside risks to inflation and unemployment have increased. Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson is scheduled to speak at 9:10 am, while San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly speaks at 5:40 pm.

Forget the U.S. Downgrade. Here's What Really Matters to the Market. — Barrons.com,1747691580000,"By Ian SalisburyMoody's downgrade to the U.S.'s credit rating initially shook the market as it kicked off the week.The S&P 500 was down early Monday, before recovering to finish up 0.1%, as investors reacted to the firm's recent decision to strip U.S. sovereign debt of its triple-A credit rating.While psychologically jarring, history suggests the downgrade will have little impact on stock returns in the longer term. Instead, investors should focus on corporate earnings.""The history of U.S. sovereign debt rating agency downgrades spans +10 years and uniformly shows that these actions do not portend higher rates, recession, or lower stock prices,"" wrote DataTrek analyst Nicholas Colas in a note Monday. ""Over the last 20 years, 10-year Treasury yields were highest when America was AAA rated by all three agencies,""Indeed, Colas noted Standard & Poor's cut its rating on U.S. debt all the way back in 2011, and Fitch did so in 2023. Neither move ultimately scared investors away from Treasury bonds, which remained capital markets ultimate safe haven. Meanwhile the S&P 500 has enjoyed one of its best stretches in recent memory.A better way to gauge where stocks are headed may simply be to focus on corporate profits. There has been cause for worry there too, noted Morgan Stanley analyst Michael J. Wilson in a Monday note, but the picture is improving. One of Wilson's preferred gauges is ""earnings revision breadth,"" a sentiment measure which compares the number of downward earnings revisions issued by Wall Street stock analysts to upward ones.While the earnings revision breadth measure is still bearish, it's improved dramatically in the past few weeks. Wilson notes that breadth for the S&P 500 is now at -15%, up from a low of -25% in mid-April. If that trend continues, the S&P 500 could approach its mid-February highs.""The combination of upside momentum in revisions breadth and last week's deal with China has placed the S&P 500 firmly back in our pre-Liberation Day range of 5500-6100,"" Wilson wrote. ""We think continued upward progress in EPS revisions breadth back toward 0% will be needed to break through 6100 on the upside.""The S&P 500 hit its all-time high of 6144 on Feb. 19Among the sectors that have enjoyed the biggest rebounds are media and entertainment, materials, capital goods and tech hardware. By contrast, laggards with worsening outlooks include consumer durables, autos and consumer services.Citi analysts, for their part, are also bearish on consumer stocks, worrying about recent signs that spending by American consumers is slowing. On Friday, the University of Michigan reported its consumer sentiment index slipped to 50.8, its second-lowest reading in more than 40 years.""We have been [underweight] consumer discretionary and staples stocks this year as the U.S. consumer has been in the crosshairs of tariff policy risk,"" analysts wrote Friday. ""A worst-case policy impact has seemingly been alleviated, yet recent signs of consumer slowing are concerning.""Citi analysis recommended investors who do want to own consumer stocks pick and choose, with an emphasis on defensive names. To that end, they ran a screen hunting for individual stocks, with low cyclicality, high debt-to-capital ratios and high capital expenditures relative to deprecation.Among the names that came up: Walmart, Dollar Tree, Amazon and Procter & Gamble.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Dream Finders Homes builds homes in Florida, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Virginia, Maryland and Tennessee.In the first quarter, gross margins were up 140 basis points to 19.2%. Net new orders were up 18% to 2,032 from 1,724. Dream Finders Homes reiterated full year guidance of 9,250 home closures.Shares of the home builders like Dream Finders Homes have struggled in 2025. Dream Finders Homes is up just 1.8% year-to-date. It’s a true value though. It has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 6.9. A P/E under 10 is considered “dirt cheap.”Dream Finders Homes also has a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.6. It has a return on equity (ROE) of 29.4%. Value investors often look for double digit growth in ROE.Should value investors be looking at homebuilders like Dream Finders Homes?2. The Coca-Cola Co. KOCoca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett’s long-time holdings. He loves the product and keeps the cans in front of him on the table at the annual meeting. And, yes, he drinks it.Shares of Coca-Cola have outperformed in 2025, gaining 11.7% year-to-date. Over the last 5 years, it’s up 55%. That is underperforming the S&P 500, however, which is up 97% in that same time.Coca-Cola isn’t cheap. It trades with a forward PE of 24. Coca-Cola also has a ROE of 45.Is Coca-Cola still a value stock?3. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZNMany people don’t realize that Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Amazon. It’s a small position, however.

"US Chip, Software Giants Enter 'Watershed Moment' in AI Shift to Mideast, Wedbush Says",1747668681000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and other US semiconductor and software giants face a ""watershed moment"" as the artificial intelligence revolution expands to the Middle East, Wedbush Securities said Monday in a note. ""The market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names,"" Wedbush said. President Donald Trump's Middle East trip culminated in deals for the delivery of 18,000 Nvidia chips to Saudi Arabia for a 500-megawatt data center and for the largest AI data center outside the US in Abu Dhabi, the report said. The announcements mark the ""start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,"" said the investment firm. The ""massive AI buildout"" in Saudi Arabia and the UAE might open up a ""huge opportunity"" and total addressable market in the next decade for Nvidia, Palantir Technologies NASDAQ:PLTR , Microsoft, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and other companies, Wedbush said. The tech boom in the Middle East ""also speaks to this global game of high stakes poker being played by the Trump administration"" as China faces US chip restrictions, the report said.

3 Reasons Why Alibaba Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q4 Earnings Beat,1747665060000,"Alibaba Group BABA recently reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results, showcasing resilience and strategic positioning that make it an attractive investment opportunity in the current market. (Read More: Alibaba Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)Despite missing revenue estimates slightly, the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant delivered strong earnings growth and demonstrated clear momentum across key business segments. With shares trading at significantly discounted valuations compared to industry peers, there are compelling reasons to consider BABA stock as a smart investment.Alibaba’s Impressive Earnings Growth Alongside Strategic FocusAlibaba reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per ADS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, beating analyst expectations by an impressive 16.89%. This represents a substantial 23% year-over-year increase in earnings, indicating strong operational efficiency and profitability despite challenging market conditions. While revenues of $32.6 billion (RMB 236.5 billion) grew 7% year over year, slightly missing estimates, the company's adjusted EBITA jumped 36% to RMB 32.6 billion ($4.5 billion).The company's performance reflects successful execution of its dual growth strategy focusing on e-commerce and AI+Cloud, with all segments achieving year-over-year EBITA improvements this quarter. Management's ""user first, AI-driven"" approach has yielded meaningful results with accelerated growth across core businesses. This strategy positions Alibaba to leverage its technological strengths while maintaining leadership in its traditional e-commerce markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $143.48 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings indicating an upward revision of 1.1% over the past 60 days to $10.95 per share, the market appears to be optimistic about Alibaba's growth trajectory.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and ConsensusAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.AI-Driven Cloud Growth Shows Promising MomentumThe accelerating performance of the company’s Cloud Intelligence Group is noteworthy. Cloud revenues grew 18% year over year, with AI-related product revenues maintaining triple-digit growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. This momentum positions Alibaba to capture significant market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing and AI sectors.The company has made substantial investments in AI infrastructure and advanced technologies, strengthening its global leadership position. The April release of its next-generation Qwen3 model as open source, which ranked among the top performers globally on multiple authoritative benchmarks, demonstrates Alibaba's commitment to innovation in this space.Industry penetration of Alibaba's AI products continues to expand beyond traditional tech sectors into manufacturing, animal farming, and other traditional industries. This diversification of the customer base suggests substantial growth potential as AI adoption accelerates across the global economy. With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell Snowflake Stock Before Q1 Earnings?",1747664100000,"Snowflake SNOW is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on May 21.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 21.13%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating 57.14% year-over-year growth.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, missing once, the average earnings surprise being 28.04%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Snowflake Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Key Factors to Note for SNOW’s Q1 EarningsSnowflake’s fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from an expanding clientele and a strong partner base. Snowflake continues to gain from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected in a net revenue retention rate of 126% as of Jan. 31, 2025. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW’s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake’s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base. YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients. Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW’s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW’s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI’s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake’s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW’s partnership with Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs. Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company’s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

UBER vs. GRAB: Which Ride-Hailing Stock is a Stronger Play Now?,1747663860000,"Uber Technologies UBER and Grab GRAB both provide ride-hailing services. The companies have revolutionized the transportation industry with their innovative business models centered on ride-sharing.However, the companies operate in different regions and have distinct approaches. While Uber operates globally, Grab is a leading provider of deliveries, mobility and digital financial services sectors in multiple cities across eight countries in Southeast Asia — Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Even though Uber’s primary business is ride-sharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time.Given this difference in approaches and geographical focus of the two companies, let’s examine closely to find out which one currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter investment now.The Case for UberUber is based in San Francisco, CA. Uber’s ridesharing and delivery platforms are growing in popularity. This is generating strong demand, which, along with the latest growth initiatives and continued cost discipline, is driving the company’s results.In its recently released first-quarter 2025 results, Uber continued its streak of beating earnings expectations, showing resilience despite tough conditions.Uber Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUber price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Uber QuoteIn the June quarter, gross bookings are anticipated to be in the $45.75 billion - $47.25 billion range, indicating 16-20% growth on a constant currency basis from second-quarter 2024 actuals. The guidance includes an estimated 1.5 percentage point impact of currency headwind (including a roughly 3 percentage point currency headwind to Mobility).Earnings Estimates for UberUber aims to gain a stronghold in the highly promising robotaxi market through strategic partnerships. By adopting this approach, Uber has been able to avoid the massive R&D costs associated with developing autonomous systems independently. Moreover, Uber has engaged in numerous acquisitions, geographic and product diversifications, and innovations. Its endeavors to expand into international markets are commendable and provide it with the benefits of geographical diversification.Another area of confidence is Uber’s buyback strategy. In 2024, Uber generated a record $6.9 billion in free cash flow, with an adjusted EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Uber’s announcement to start an accelerated $1.5 billion stock buyback program highlights not only its shareholder-friendly strategy but also signals confidence in its ongoing business strategy. The $1.5 billion plan is part of the company's $7 billion buyback program announced last year.In 2018, Uber, which went public in 2019, sold its business in Southeast Asia to Grab. Uber has a significant stake in Grab.The Case for GrabGrab's ability to adapt to local conditions is a key contributor to its success in Southeast Asia. Moreover, Grab’s evolution from a taxi-hailing app into an ""everyday everything app"" offering various services, including food delivery, e-scooter rentals and digital payments, is commendable and highlights its desire to expand. Grab is benefiting from strong growth in its On-Demand Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”), expanding fintech offerings, and increasing user engagement across its platform. On-demand GMV refers to the sum of GMV of the mobility and deliveries segments. In the first quarter of 2025, On-Demand GMV increased 16% year over year. Grab expects 2025 revenues between $3.33 billion and $3.40 billion, indicating 19-22% year-over-year growth. Grab Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGrab price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Grab QuoteGrab is strengthening its position across Southeast Asia by partnering with  Amazon ’s AMZN cloud computing platform — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — to drive growth in mobility, deliveries and financial services.In December 2024, Grab selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate growth across its mobility, deliveries, and financial services verticals, including its digital banks. Grab has enhanced operational efficiency, reduced infrastructure costs and launched innovative services by utilizing AWS’ scalable, secure and cost-efficient cloud solutions.Earnings Estimates for GrabGrab Appears to Be More Pricey Than UberUber is trading at a forward sales multiple of 3.58, above its median of 2.54 over the last three years. Uber has a Value Score of D. Meanwhile, Grab has a Value Score of F, with its forward sales multiple at 5.78, above its 3-year median of 4.85.ConclusionUber’s expensive valuation (compared to its 3-year median) seems to suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for this dominant player in the ride-hailing industry. The company’s diversification efforts and shareholder-friendly approach attest to its financial bliss. Uber’s large size (market capitalization of $191.95 billion) positions it well to overcome uncertain times, such as the current one.Grab, on the other hand, has a much narrower geographical focus, making it highly susceptible to economic downturns, such as the current scenario. The economic uncertainty in key Southeast Asia markets, driven by factors like inflation, changing consumer behavior, and supply-chain disruptions, is hurting Grab. Moreover, Grab faces intense competition in its deliveries segment. The much smaller Grab, with a market capitalization of $20.5 billion, is not as shareholder-friendly, as its larger rival.On the basis of our analysis, Uber seems a better pick than Grab, despite both carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfb690819094b:0-uber-vs-grab-which-ride-hailing-stock-is-a-stronger-play-now/
Equities Mixed as Investors Parse Inflation Data; Nvidia Leads Tech Rally,1747169830000,"US equity indexes ended mixed Tuesday as Wall Street digested official April inflation data, while technology stocks advanced led by Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA . The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6% to 19,010.1, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.7% to 5,886.6. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% to 42,140.4. Among sectors, technology paced the gainers, with a 2.3% jump, while health care saw the biggest drop of 3%. In economic news, US consumer prices rebounded last month, but missed Wall Street's estimates, while annual inflation eased to the lowest level since February 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. ""There isn't a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the (consumer price index) in April, but this shouldn't be surprising as it takes time,"" Oxford Economics said. ""The areas where tariffs likely boosted prices in April were in furniture/bedding, appliances, and to a lesser extent toys.""The US and China recently reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties. The two countries had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The official US producer prices report for April is scheduled to be released Thursday. Small business optimism in the US deteriorated for a fourth consecutive month in April as owners continue to grapple with macro uncertainty, a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business showed Tuesday. Uncertainty remained ""a major impediment"" for owners in April, impacting hiring plans, investment decisions and other aspects of business, NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said. US Treasury yields were mixed, with the 10-year rate edging higher by 0.9 basis point to 4.48% and the two-year rate easing 1.6 basis points to 4.02%.

Should You Stay Invested in or Sell CoreWeave Stock Post Q1 Earnings?,1747656720000,"CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39. With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let’s address this question by evaluating the company’s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV’s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV’s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter’s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement’s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave’s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a0f366036094b:0-should-you-stay-invested-in-or-sell-coreweave-stock-post-q1-earnings/
