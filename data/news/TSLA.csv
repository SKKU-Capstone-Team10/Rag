"Musk says he'll resume working '24/7' at his companies, X outage mostly restored",1748103474000,"Elon Musk's social media platform X was largely restored for most users after an outage that impacted tens of thousands of users in the United States on Saturday, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com, following which he said that he is ""back to spending 24/7"" at his companies.At its peak around 8:51 a.m. ET (1251 GMT), there were more than 25,800 incidents of people reporting issues with the social media platform, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources including users. The number of outages has since gone below 650, as of 12:09 p.m. ET.""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms. I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out,"" Musk said in an X post. Thousands of users in other countries, such as Germany, Spain, France, India, Canada, Australia, and Britain, also experienced issues with accessing the social media platform at the height of the outage, according to Downdetector data.X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the outage.Musk, who spent nearly $300 million to back U.S. President Donald Trump's presidential campaign and other Republicans last year, said on Tuesday he will cut his political spending substantially, signalling that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.He led the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs and cancel billions of dollars in contracts and grants.However, his political views triggered waves of protests against Tesla in the U.S. and Europe, leading to a slump in sales, with the automaker reporting its first drop in annual deliveries last year.The amount of time Musk has spent at Tesla has concerned some investors. Looking to ease those worries, Musk told investors last month he would reduce his time with DOGE to a day or two a week from May.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L2N3RW01X:0-musk-says-he-ll-resume-working-24-7-at-his-companies-x-outage-mostly-restored/"
Tim Higgins: Angry Elon Is Back. That's Good for Tesla. — WSJ,1748079000000,"By Tim HigginsListening to Elon Musk these days is to hear a man who feels unfairly treated.And, as he skulks away from the White House with his tail between his legs, he is particularly thin skinned. Angry that he was cast as a Nazi. Angry that some used his politics as an excuse to attack Tesla. Angry that he's being scrutinized.We've seen this before. Musk has always had an incredibly large chip on his shoulder — one fueled by perceived slights and personal grievances, critics expressing disbelief and the chorus of social-media doubters.But history has shown that it can unleash something fierce: Angry Elon. Like the Incredible Hulk busting out of his britches and turning green, Musk goes silent before exploding. These days, Musk again seems to be fuming, his eyes darting upward, his vision clouded red with anger.And Angry Elon could be a very good thing for Tesla investors. It can focus him on executing, on proving everyone wrong. A Musk that executes can go to outer space, can make electric cars mainstream.But investors haven't seen Musk execute in a while.Instead, they've seen promises of a cheap Tesla that would fuel 20 million annual vehicle sales seemingly abandoned. They've seen the Cybertruck flop. They've seen profitability shrink and sales fall for the first time in more than a decade.Worrisome stuff to investors concerned Musk has been too distracted in Washington. Even board members appeared unnerved.But fans remembering the power of Angry Elon drew hope from signs this past week that he might be back. First, via video link to a conference in Qatar, Musk on Tuesday delivered salty answer after salty answer to concerns about the state of his companies.Asked when he might be able to turn things around at Tesla, the chief executive replied, ""It's already turned around.""Musk's proof point? Essentially, the age-old retort by Tesla fans on social media: The stock price, bro!Since announcing on April 22 that he would pare back his time in the Trump administration, Tesla shares have risen 43%. This returned the automaker to the rarefied status of being valued at slightly more than $1 trillion. Overall, those shares are still down both 11% year-to-date and 29% from an all-time high.Analysts estimate Tesla unit sales will finish the year down from 2024. This is a reversal from just a few months ago when they expected year-over-year gains.Musk's vision for the future of Tesla isn't bothered by the boring part of selling electric vehicles. Instead, his future is all about ushering in a new era of robotics — driverless cars and humanoid robots.For roughly a decade, he has said the day was near for Tesla's autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon.com's Zoox have put fully autonomous cars on public roads.On Tuesday, Musk doubled down in a second public appearance, this time on CNBC, reaffirming that Tesla is on track to begin offering driverless cars in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.The plan, he said, is to begin with probably 10 vehicles on the road in the first week, then increase that figure by tens of vehicles each week and probably reach 1,000 within a few months. He added that there would probably be hundreds of thousands of autonomous Tesla vehicles by the end of next year, if not more than one million.It's the kind of ultra-ambitious targets he has promoted before. He just needs to execute.During the CNBC interview, his recent track record in Washington was questioned and he snapped again: ""Why are you attacking this, given that we've made so much progress?""Even as he defended his DOGE efforts, Musk has begun amplifying the idea that he is stepping back from politics after realizing the Republican-controlled Congress lacks the appetite to implement spending reductions. ""I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential,"" he posted Friday. "" @DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.""And robots are his solution.Seeing glimpses of Angry Elon excites supporters the same way Optimistic Elon did almost a year ago at the Tesla annual meeting. His enthusiasm — dancing around on stage — seemed to signal he was dialed in after more than a year of distractions from buying Twitter.After shareholders re-approved his massive pay package, Musk stood on stage painting a bright Tesla future filled with humanoid robots and driverless cars. He suggested that could drive the company's valuation to more than $30 trillion.Now, supporters are hoping Angry Elon is ready to finally deliver.""War time Elon is activated,"" a popular X account called Autism Capital posted in response to Musk's Qatar appearance. Others crowed something similar. ""Elon is in WAR TIME CEO mode,"" a MAGA social-media account posted Wednesday. ""He is done playing around. Total laser focus on execution.""Tesla was founded on a rather unlikely idea of making EVs cool and mainstream. For much of its existence, Tesla has faced criticism that it couldn't succeed. And Musk was out there selling investors and customers on the idea that the vision was, in fact, possible.He just needed to execute. And once he did, it was a real game-changer. Tesla hit its stride in late 2019 and 2020, becoming consistently profitable and cementing Musk's image as one of the most successful entrepreneurs of a generation.Of course, past success isn't a guarantee of future success.Even Tesla's position as the global leader of electric vehicles is under threat from Chinese rivals, such as BYD. It outsold the U.S. EV maker in Europe for the first time last month.Musk, who has long praised his Chinese competitors, claimed he wasn't following the sales race. ""I don't really think about competitors,"" Musk said on CNBC. ""I just think about making the products as perfect as possible.""He just needs to execute.Write to Tim Higgins at tim.higgins@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250524001145:0/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Shares of the electric-vehicle company closed up 1.9% on Thursday, even as the Trump tax-and-spending bill that was passed by the House of Representatives included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay annual fees, while the Republican-led Senate voted to revoke a California measure that banned the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. On Friday, Wedbush analysts maintained their Outperform rating on the stock and raised their price target to $500 from $350.Intuit, the owner of TurboTax and Credit Karma, rose 8% after boosting its fiscal-year outlook following stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. The company expects fiscal-year revenue of $18.72 billion to $18.76 billion, an increase of 15% from a year earlier compared with previous guidance that called for a revenue jump of 12% to 13%.Workday reported first-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates as subscription revenue rose 13% to about $2.06 billion. The software company said it anticipates second-quarter subscription revenue of $2.16 billion — up nearly 14% from a year earlier, but slightly below forecasts. Shares fell 12.5%.Nuclear energy stocks surged after President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders that were meant to kickstart the production of nuclear power in the U.S., including a directive to speed up the construction of advanced reactors at federal sites.

The company said that while it directly imports ""only a small portion of our merchandise, more than half of the goods we sell originate from China. As such, we expect pressure on our profitability if tariffs remain at elevated levels.""Deckers Outdoor cratered 20% after the maker of Hoka running shoes and UGG boots issued fiscal first-quarter guidance that missed Wall Street expectations. Deckers said it expects earnings in the period of 62 cents to 67 cents a share, below consensus of 79 cents. The company also forecast first-quarter revenue that missed estimates. Deckers said it wouldn't be providing fiscal 2026 guidance because of ""macroeconomic uncertainty related to evolving global trade policies.""Hinge Health gained 7.3%.

Trump Tax Bill Could 'Devastate' Clean Energy. Here Are the Few Bright Spots. — Barrons.com,1748027340000,"By Avi SalzmanInvestors knew that President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would be bad for clean energy. Subsidies for projects like solar and wind farms were bound to be gutted to pay for tax cuts. But the bill that passed the House of Representatives on Thursday was worse than most of them expected.There's a very gloomy future ahead in some areas if the bill isn't changed dramatically in the Senate.""This bill is going to be devastating to the industry if it's passed by the Senate,"" said Heather Cooper, a lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery who works with clean energy companies. ""It takes the tax credits that have been in the code for decades, and that were extended and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act, and it essentially repeals pretty much all of those incentives almost immediately for almost all types of projects.""Cooper said her clients were ""jaw-dropped and dumbfounded that this went through.""""This is a highly robust industry with hundreds of thousands of workers and employees,"" she said. A Princeton University analysis found that the bill almost entirely repeals the Inflation Reduction Act, which would jeopardize more than $500 billion of already-announced clean energy manufacturing projects.Cooper's clients are hopeful that the Senate will change the bill significantly, but she's less optimistic.Certain clean energy industries would get hit harder than others. The worst-hit areas appear to be rooftop solar and electric vehicles, which would quickly lose financial support that they had counted on for years. Areas that appear to have survived with less damage include biofuels, nuclear energy, and carbon capture. But all of those industries have their own problems beyond the bill.Rooftop solarThe bill removes a rooftop solar tax credit that allowed homeowners to take a credit worth 30% of the value of the project. It also limits how companies that lease solar panels to consumers can claim tax credits — an unexpected change that would have a particularly dramatic effect on SunRun, the leader in that industry. It also forbids companies from selling the tax credits to other buyers, taking away a mechanism that had greased the wheels of the industry.SunRun stock fell 37% on Thursday. BMO Markets analyst Ameet Thakkar downgraded SunRun's shares to Underperform and predicted that there will be ""limited political will to claw back residential credits in any Senate version."" Sunnova, another company that leases solar panels to customers, warned investors earlier this year that there's a chance it will not be able to stay in business — even before this bill was finalized.Electric vehiclesMost kinds of EVs will lose access to $7,500 tax credits that will make them less price-competitive against gasoline-powered cars. The bill would also add new fees to buyers of certain low-emission vehicles, adding charges of $250 a year for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids. The EV boom had already begun to slow, but the new costs and loss of tax breaks will almost certainly slow sales further. Tesla may weather the changes better than peers who have a smaller customer base, but it could still be hurt.Utility-scale solarUtilities install large arrays of solar panels to generate electricity. The bill will quickly remove the tax credits they receive for installing them, making them less cost-competitive with fossil-fuel-powered generators, like natural gas plants. Clean energy projects would have to start up within 60 days of passage of the bill to still be eligible.Cooper said her clients who install panels are in a rush to get equipment and get projects started.""I suspect every module manufacturer has gotten 100 phone calls today,"" she said. ""There's gonna be a lot of activity as people scramble to engage in activities in the next 60-something days.""The changes could have an impact on big utility-scale installers like NextEra Energy and AES, whose stocks fell sharply Thursday. Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith downgraded AES stock to Underperform on Tuesday, citing its ""difficult path forward"".Clean energy manufacturingThe bill was mostly a negative for companies that manufacture clean energy products like batteries and solar panels in the United States. It will phase outthe credits supporting manufacturing more quickly than expected, and impose strict rules to forbid tax breaks to companies that rely on Chinese suppliers and other ""foreign entities of concern.""That's particularly bad for battery makers, who are heavily dependent on China. First Solar, which manufactures solar panels for utilities in the U.S., should benefit from the domestic manufacturing rules. But First Solar will likely be hurt by a drop in demand for solar because of the removal of tax credits available to utilities for installing it.WindWind power is and has been in a deep rut. The bill takes away its tax credits, and sunsets credits for wind manufacturing even faster than solar. Wind equipment companies like Vestas will have to rely on overseas business for now. The one bright spot is that the stocks were already beaten down, so they reflect very low expectations.BiofuelsCredits for the production of biofuels from plant and animal byproducts survived the House bill, and production credits were even extended by an extra year. Midwestern congressional representatives like those credits, which help farmers.That political support would seem to be a boon for biofuels players like Darling Industries, Calumet and Neste. But those companies have other problems right now that make them shaky investments, and have sent all the stocks lower this year. There simply isn't enough demand for biofuels, and they're not cost-competitive when gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices are cheap like they are today. Other Trump administration policies that pull back support for clean energy are also hurting the industry.NuclearCredits for nuclear energy mostly survived the House bill, though one crucial credit will fade away a year earlier than expected.Both Democrats and Republicans favor nuclear energy, and have called for a ""renaissance."" And the credits' survival is a good sign for owners of existing nuclear reactors, like Constellation Energy.A separate production tax credit available to nuclear power is only available to projects that start construction by the end of 2028 — a relatively short timeline for companies that can take many years to get all the permits and financing. And the tax credits don't solve the bigger problem for nuclear, which is finding utilities, lenders, and a customer base who are willing to take on the financial risk of developing new reactors. Until those issues are cleared up, start-ups like Oklo and Nuscale could still face challenges.Carbon captureThe bill also continues to support carbon capture, a process that involves siphoning off carbon emissions from industrial plants and oil wells, and then liquefying the carbon and storing it underground. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil have been investing in the area, and could profit off the credits. But demand for carbon capture is still scarce, and Trump's rollback of other environmental rules calls into question whether companies will continue to pursue low-carbon strategies.There also aren't many ways for investors to buy into the industry. Occidental Petroleum, the oil company that is farthest along in its carbon-capture efforts, has other problems that have sunk its stock in recent years, like high indebtedness.Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Slides as Grok Rolls Into Federal Agencies,1748016227000,"Shares of Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA fell nearly 1% after Reuters reported that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiencynicknamed DOGEhas begun using a customized version of its Grok chatbot across multiple federal departments, including Homeland Security, without formal agency approval. Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters the aim is to sift data and auto-generate reports, with Grok launched by Musk's xAI in 2023. Analysts warn this unvetted deployment may breach long-standing privacy safeguards and give Musk unfair access to nonpublic federal contracting information. Two of the sources said DOGE staff pushed DHS officials to adopt Grok, even though it hasn't been vetted; it's unclear what specific datasets have been fed into the system.

"Tesla Set to Start New Growth Era in AI, Autonomous Tech, Wedbush Says",1748005275000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA is now on the verge of a ""golden age of autonomous growth"" after CEO and founder Elon Musk stepped back from his role in the US Department of Government Efficiency and recommitted to leading the company, Wedbush said in a Friday note. The company is set to begin its next era of growth centered on its autonomous vision, kicking off with key launch of its robotaxis in Austin, Texas, this June, Wedbush analysts said. The analysts said that Tesla's AI and autonomous opportunity is worth around $1 trillion, with the regulatory hurdles having been cleared significantly under the Trump administration.

Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

"Tariff crossfire hits Toyota, Nissan, Ford suppliers in Japan",1747967270000,"Four decades ago, Hiroko Suzuki's father threaded the needle of a U.S. trade war by pushing the family auto-parts business into newer niche products. Now, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are so sweeping they threaten her own attempt to diversify the 78-year-old company into medical devices.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has called the U.S. tariffs, including 25% on automobiles, a ""national crisis"" for the world's fourth-largest economy. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, headed to Washington on Friday for a third round of talks.The worry is evident at companies like Kyowa Industrial, a maker of prototype parts and race-car components based in Takasaki, north of Tokyo. Kyowa, which employs 120 people, was among six auto suppliers that told Reuters they were concerned about their ability to withstand the tariff pressure on Japan's car industry.""What in the world are we going to do?"" Suzuki, Kyowa's third-generation president, recalled thinking when the tariffs were announced. ""This is going to be bad."" The problems Kyowa and other auto suppliers face illustrate a decades-long shift in Japan, which no longer floods the world with chips and consumer electronics and is reliant on an auto industry threatened by intense Chinese competition. That marks a contrast with the 1980s, when the U.S. slapped trade barriers on a rising Japan and its then-barnstorming exports.This report, which is based on interviews with a dozen people, including industry executives, bankers and senior government officials, provides a first-hand account of how one firm is grappling with the uncertainty, and details the deepening squeeze on the automotive supply chain at a time of profound disruption.Kyowa and thousands of other small manufacturers comprise an auto-supply network that has for decades pursued a ""monozukuri"" (literally, ""making things"") approach to production. That culture of incremental improvement and assembly-line efficiency, based on methods developed by Toyota, helped make Japan a juggernaut. But the shift to battery-powered smart cars has meant software, in which EV makers such as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and China's BYD SZSE:002594 excel, has become a bigger selling point.Kyowa started developing neurosurgery instruments in 2016 after Suzuki, now 65, realised the rise of EVs would eventually hammer demand for engine components. It began selling the instruments in the U.S. last year, only to find that Trump's tariffs also applied to medical devices.Kyowa doesn't export auto components to the U.S., but Suzuki worries automakers will force suppliers to cut prices to offset tariffs. So far, that hasn't happened to her.One Subaru Corp TSE:7270 supplier said his company may have to start looking for partners expanding outside the U.S. Major automakers have largely offered muted support for suppliers since Trump's tariff announcements. Last month, Toyota TSE:7203 , Nissan TSE:7201 and Ford NYSE:F sent letters to the U.S. arms of some Japanese suppliers asking for cooperation in the face of tariffs, according to copies reviewed by Reuters, without offering specifics.The letters haven't been previously reported.Nissan told suppliers they should stick to previously agreed prices. It said it was ""not obliged"" to bear the costs of tariffs but that it would shoulder some of the hit for up to four weeks to help secure its supply chain. It added that it could later seek to recover any support payments to suppliers.Reuters couldn't determine how much support, if any, Nissan extended. The automakers haven't sent follow-up letters, according to two suppliers, who allowed Reuters to review the correspondence on condition of anonymity.Nissan told Reuters it was working with suppliers to mitigate the tariff impact and contain costs, including through localisation.Toyota said it would seek to protect its suppliers, dealers, and employees while maintaining customers' trust as it navigated the uncertainty created by the tariffs. Ford told Reuters it was working with suppliers to assess their exposure and potentially reconfigure processes and sourcing. In its letter, Toyota said it understood the ""complexity and financial burden some suppliers are facing"" and asked suppliers to identify and share mitigation measures. Toyota would work with suppliers ""in good faith"", it said.Some Toyota suppliers, including Denso TSE:6902 , have not given earnings forecasts for the coming year, citing uncertainty.Julie Boote, an analyst at research firm Pelham Smithers Associates, said the trade war posed an ""emergency"" for Japan's auto industry that would hasten consolidation.""In order to survive, these automakers will have to work together,"" she said. SQUEEZED ON COSTJapanese manufacturers traditionally put pressure on smaller suppliers to lower prices, said Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member who is now a professor at Keio University. If the tariffs remain in place in the longer term, it would spell more damage for regional economies hollowed out by demographic decline, she said.The risks for Japan are already clear. The economy shrank in the first quarter, and Tokyo has compiled emergency economic measures to ease the pain of tariffs.""Automobile exports are just too important to Japan for a 25% tariff to stay in place,"" said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now a director at consulting firm Eurasia Group. Boling said the U.S. is unlikely to go below the 10% it agreed with Britain.Trump introduced a 25% tariff on automobiles and later a 24% tariff on all Japanese goods. The latter was slashed to 10% for 90 days, which runs out in July.Akazawa, the trade envoy, on Tuesday said Japan was sticking to its guns and wanted tariffs eliminated. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations.A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration wanted trading partners to align with U.S. efforts to achieve ""fairness and balance in our trading relationships and protect U.S. economic and national security.""Two senior Japanese officials told Reuters Japan's auto industry was increasingly looking like a laggard and needed to use the tariffs as an opportunity to implement sweeping changes to catch up with EV rivals.In a statement, the trade ministry said that regardless of U.S. tariffs, Japan's auto industry needed to respond to significant changes in the competitive environment.Japan's top auto suppliers, called Tier 1, procure parts from Tier 2 suppliers, and so on down the chain. At the bottom are firms that can be little more than neighbourhood workshops grinding out a single part.Government officials have previously urged smaller companies to innovate and consolidate, to gain scale.At regional lender Ashikaga Bank, an automotive industry team supports some 200 companies, around 80% of which are Tier 2 or lower suppliers. A member of the team not authorised to speak publicly said they worried tariffs would lead to higher vehicle prices and a decline in Japanese car sales in the U.S., hitting the bank's clients.Shinichi Iizuka, president of Toa Kogyo, a suspension maker in Subaru's hometown of Ota, near Takasaki, said the tariff burden will likely be shared by consumers, car dealers, automakers and suppliers. Some 70% of Subaru's car sales are in the U.S., where it relies on both local manufacturing and imports. On Monday, Subaru said it would raise prices on several U.S. models.Subaru CFO Shinsuke Toda this month said it was willing to talk with suppliers about sharing their burden, adding the situation remained unclear.IT'S PERSONALSuzuki's drive to diversify Kyowa Industrial into medical devices mirrors the pivot made by her father during the 1980s trade friction, when Kyowa ditched mass production of less-profitable auto parts to focus on higher-margin prototypes and racing-engine components. Suzuki took over in 2000 and her father died in 2013.Before Trump's tariffs, Suzuki had planned to build a U.S. track record in sales of medical equipment to smooth entry into other markets. With the advent of the U.S. trade barriers, she said her team considered moving production to the U.S., where costs are high, or shifting the sales focus to Asia.Given the uncertainty around Trump's announcements, Kyowa is in talks with potential distributors in Singapore and Hong Kong, Suzuki said.Around 70% of Kyowa's business still comes from automakers, while chip-equipment makers and Japan's space program contribute to the remainder. It supplies most Japanese car makers, General Motors NYSE:GM and parts for Formula One race cars.Annual sales are a modest 2 billion yen ($14 million). Still, Kyowa is larger than three-quarters of the roughly 68,000 companies that make up Japan's auto-supply chain, according to research firm Teikoku Databank. For Suzuki, trade friction is also personal, given her deep affection for the U.S. She grew up listening to rock music on U.S. armed forces radio, learned English and went to university in America. She remembers seeing Aerosmith live at their first concert in Japan.""Japan and America have a long history of friendship. I hope they can find a solution,"" she said.($1 = 145.0700 yen)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0FY:0-tariff-crossfire-hits-toyota-nissan-ford-suppliers-in-japan/"

Tesla's Emissions Credits Are at Risk After Senate's California Vote — Barrons.com,1747946340000,"Al RootCongress took another step to erode California's ability to regulate emissions affecting air quality, dealing a potentially significantly blow to Tesla's ability to profit from sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission vehicles.California has long had a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency that allowed it to regulate its own air quality. But on Thursday morning, the Senate voted to essentially eliminate that, using the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies.The California Air Resources Board, which sets emission policy for the state, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Democratic lawmakers warned that set a bad precedent for upending agency decisions. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Ron Wyden (D., Ore), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways.""That means Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.The vote is just one twist in a continuing fight over California emissions. California has successfully fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past, and it has support in the current battle.""Today, in an unprecedented and illegal attack on the nation's bedrock air quality law, the United States Senate passed Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions to block states from implementing policies to reduce cancer-causing pollution from motor vehicles,"" said CALSTART, a nonprofit advancing clean transportation technologies, in an emailed statement. ""Authorization for these policies has been a core component of the Clean Air Act for more than 50 years.""Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify a so-called waiver of preemption permitting California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations that the EPA had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that follow California's standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That is a tall order because EVs account for about 20% of California's new car sales today. They are only about 7% to 8% nationwide.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which includes General Motors and Ford Motor, supports rolling back the 2030 requirement.The California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's sales of zero-emission vehicle credits, which it receives because its all-electric fleet allows it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to auto makers that haven't met the targets have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California news. Tesla stock was up 3.6% in late Thursday trading, despite the vote, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.4%.One explanation for the move is that investors are increasingly viewing Tesla as an artificial-intelligence company than a car manufacturer. Investors are focusing on the company's plans to launch a robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June — an enterprise that depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to fully overturning the California system.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Trump's $4 Trillion Tax Shock: EV Credits Slashed, Rich Rewarded, Markets Rattled",1747932769000,"President Trump's flagship tax bill just scraped through the House in a nail-biting 215214 vote. Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the package delivers fresh tax breaks for high earners and legacy industrieswhile blowing a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase amid ballooning deficit concerns. Trump called it the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed, but markets are already calculating the long-term cost. The bill now moves to the Senate, where even GOP lawmakers are signaling major revisions ahead.Bond markets may be the first to flinch. Moody's NYSE:MCO already warned of rising debt risksand this bill could pour fuel on that fire. It extends Trump-era tax cuts, raises the SALT cap to $40,000, and adds military and immigration spending increases. At the same time, it phases out EV tax creditsincluding for Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA by 2025. In their place? A deduction for auto loan interest on U.S.-built gas vehicles. Freedom Caucus members also secured cuts to clean energy subsidies and accelerated work requirements for Medicaid, all timed just ahead of the midterms.Investors are now watching the Senate closely. Some Republicans want to make corporate tax cuts permanent. Others are pushing back on healthcare reductions and demanding deeper spending cuts. The final version could still swing dramatically. But for now, this bill looks like a near-term win for fossil fuels, high earners, and Trump's political baseand a potential headache for bondholders, clean tech, and anyone betting on long-term U.S. fiscal discipline.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:17e0c3be9094b:0-trump-s-4-trillion-tax-shock-ev-credits-slashed-rich-rewarded-markets-rattled/

US Senate votes to block California 2035 electric vehicle rules,1747929849000,"The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 that has been adopted by 11 other states representing a third of the U.S. auto market.The vote sends to President Donald Trump the measure to repeal a waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December, allowing California to mandate at least 80% of vehicles be electric vehicles by 2035. The vote is a win for General Motors NYSE:GM , Toyota TSE:7203 and other automakers that heavily lobbied against the rules and a blow to California and environmental groups that say the requirements are essential to ensuring cleaner vehicles and cutting pollution.California first announced a plan in 2020 to require that by 2035 at least 80% of new cars sold be electric and up to 20% plug-in hybrid models.""This Senate vote is illegal,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said, adding the Senate action would cost California taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in additional health care costs. ""We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.""Since 1970, California has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act.Senate Republicans rejected the advice of the parliamentarian in moving forward. In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act, which only requires a majority of the U.S. Senate.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing GM, Toyota, Volkswagen XETR:VOW , Hyundai KRX:005380 , Stellantis MIL:STLAM and others, praised the vote.""The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,"" the group's CEO, John Bozzella, said. ""In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla.""Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen denounced the vote. ""While our Republican leaders may try to put the horse back in the barn when it comes to electric vehicles, the world has already shifted under their feet,"" she said. Tesla did not immediately comment. GM praised the vote, saying it would ""align emissions standards with today’s market realities.""The Senate separately voted Thursday to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks and to bar California's low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines.These are the latest actions in recent months taking aim at electric vehicles.A separate bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday would end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. It would also phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028.If upheld by the courts, rescinding California's rules will make it easier for automakers to delay or cancel some EV production. Automakers had warned in the coming months they might have been forced to limit gas-powered vehicles in some states.California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models. Automakers say it is impossible for them to meet that figure given current EV sales, which are 10% or lower in some states adopting the rules. Vermont and Maryland have delayed compliance.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU0RF:0-us-senate-votes-to-block-california-2035-electric-vehicle-rules/"

China's BYD Outsells Tesla in Europe for First Time,1747924980000,"By Mauro OrruChinese auto giant BYD sold more electric vehicles in Europe than Tesla for the first time, a setback for Elon Musk's EV maker as it faces growing competition overseas.Tesla registered 7,165 battery-electric vehicles in Europe last month, down 49% on year according to data from Jato Dynamics, a consumer research group. In contrast, registrations for BYD more than doubled to 7,231 vehicles.""Although the difference between the two brands' monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,"" said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics. ""This is a watershed moment for Europe's car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.""Tesla sales in Europe have been languishing for months as the company grapples with stiff competition and backlash from Chief Executive Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. New car registrations for Tesla models in the European Union slumped 36% in March, 47% in February and 50% in January, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an industry body.The company in April posted a 71% fall in net income for the first quarter. Musk said at the time that he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla as investors were concerned that he had taken his eye off the ball.Meanwhile, BYD has been expanding rapidly in Europe even as the EU raised tariffs on China-made EVs. BYD's registrations, including plug-in hybrids, more than quadrupled in April from a year earlier, according to Jato Dynamics data. The research group attributed that growth to a broad and competitive lineup of fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.BYD in April reported a doubling in net profit for the first quarter. The company sold more battery EVs than Tesla in the first three months of the year, retaining the crown as the world's top EV seller.Jato Dynamics said BYD's rapid expansion in Europe had already pushed the Chinese company ahead of legacy brands, outselling Fiat and Seat in France.Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522007140:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time/

Tesla Stock Drops. The 'Big Beautiful Bill' Is Big Trouble and There's Another Vote to Watch. — Barrons.com,1747917900000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling in early trading Thursday after the House of Representatives passed its tax-and-spend bill. And its not the only vote that matters Thursday.Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were off 1.9% at $328.39, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.The House passed its budget bill on Thursday, and it included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay $250 and $100 annual fees, respectively. It also terminated credits on most clean energy initiatives, including those for new and used electric vehicles. None of that is good Tesla.But there is another vote coming Thursday, this one in the Senate, which is voting on a Congressional Review Act measure Thursday designed to essentially eliminate a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency that lets California regulate its air emissions.The CRA can be used to overturn federal agency actions.It's a controversial step. For starters, California has been regulating its air quality since the late 1960s. And Republicans have maneuvered around Senate filibuster rules. Democrats aren't happy with the strategy. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways."" Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.However the vote turns out, it appears to be just one step in a lengthy fight over California emissions. California has fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past.The Senate vote isn't the first salvo from the Republican-controlled Congress. Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify the "" waiver of preemption"" for California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations, which the Environmental Protection Agency had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that have adopted California standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of California's new car sales today. EVs are only about 7% to 8% of nationwide new car sales.Changes could be a problem for Tesla because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California air quality news. Coming into Thursday trading, shares were up almost 19% in May.One explanation for the move is AI. Investors are thinking more about the company's plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. The success of that business depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to overturn the California system fully.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

His political views have triggered waves of protests against Tesla in the U.S. and Europe, leading to a slump in sales.Additionally, production halts to retool factories to make the redesigned Model Y crossover globally caused a drop in manufacturing and sales in the first quarter.Analysts have also attributed lower sales to customers waiting for less-expensive versions of the new Model Y, Tesla's best-selling vehicle, to become more widely available.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU0QZ:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time-report-says/"

The YU7, for instance, has a driving range of up to up to 835 kilometres (519 miles) per charge, versus the redesigned Model Y that was launched in January with a range of up to 719 kilometres. ""The Model Y is priced from 263,500 yuan ($36,574) and these (YU7) configurations should make the car 60,000-70,000 yuan more expensive,"" Lei said. ""But we'll talk about the price in July.""

EV Owners Face Annual Fee Under Proposed Tax Bill — Barrons.com,1747868640000,"Al RootThe latest version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill includes another hit to the electric vehicle industry.The legislation includes a provision for the Federal Highway Administration to impose a $250 annual fee on all-electric vehicles and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.The FHA helps build and maintain roads — and gets most of its money from gasoline taxes. With all-electric cars using no gas, EV drivers get (small) free lunch paid for by drivers of gas-guzzling vehicles.The free lunch might be less than drivers of gasoline-powered cars would guess, though. Already, 37 states collect annual EV fees ranging from $50 to $250 a year. The average is about $142, according to Atlas Public Policy. Some other states collect fees at public charging stations.As for traditional cars, the amount an average driver might contribute to the FHA's Highway Trust Fund is probably about $100 annually. The new law might seem a little punitive toward EVs, but EVs are a little heavier than gasoline-powered vehicles. More weight can equal more wear and tear on the roads.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents many auto makers in Washington, including General Motors and Ford Motor, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which isn't a part of the AAI, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The latest version of the bill also ends the $7,500 purchase tax credit for qualifying electric vehicles.And earlier this month, the House voted to strip California's ability to regulate its air quality. The House resolution would need Senate approval and the president's signature to become law.That legislation could be a problem because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.California is currently requiring that roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of new car sales today.

Ahead of his first meeting in March, there was a media report that Musk would be briefed on secret war plans for China, something Musk, Trump and others denied. Musk, at the time, called the report ""pure propaganda"" and urged legal action against leakers. Musk's businesses Starlink and SpaceX already have a number of Pentagon contracts, raising questions about conflicts of interest as he advocates for innovation and re-prioritization of Pentagon spending to find efficiencies. Trump's planned Golden Dome missile defense shield, which would require hundreds of sensors and other satellites to keep watch for incoming ballistic missiles, would be a natural fit for SpaceX and its Starlink unit. The opportunities for his companies, SpaceX in particular, under Trump could drive billions of dollars of revenue to his firms. The White House has previously said Musk will recuse himself if any conflicts of interest arise between his business dealings and his role in cutting federal government spending. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has made cuts across the U.S. government, including at the Pentagon.Musk said on Tuesday he will cut his political spending substantially, the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT115:0-us-defense-secretary-hegseth-meets-musk-for-second-time-at-pentagon/"

Uber Stock Is Dropping. Blame Elon Musk and Tesla. — Barrons.com,1747861560000,"Al RootUber Technologies stock fell Wednesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he didn't need to buy the ride-hailing company. Wait. Was that on the table?Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday afternoon in Austin, Texas, where Tesla plans to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in June. Faber asked why Tesla doesn't buy Uber to give its business an immediate boost.""There's no need,"" answered Musk.Uber has created a digital platform to manage demand for rides and the supply of drivers. Musk says Tesla can develop an app of its own. What is more, ""we have millions of cars that will be able to operate autonomously,"" he said.Musk is referring to Tesla vehicles owned by regular car drivers, which will be able to operate autonomously when Tesla's full self-driving software gets good enough. He envisions Tesla owners renting out their vehicles to Tesla to make money when they aren't using them. It would be like Airbnb, but for cars.Uber stock lost 3.5%, closing at $88.67, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The effects of autonomous-driving technology have been debated for months. Fear about self-driving cars, and how they might affect companies such as Uber, likely reached its peak a year ago, around the time Musk announced that Tesla would host a robo-taxi event in August. The event was eventually held in October.From the end of 2023 into the summer of 2024, Uber stock declined about 5%.Still, Uber has its own self-driving strategy, announcing deals with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to Uber's networks in Austin and Atlanta. That helped calm investors' nerves. Coming into Wednesday trading, Uber stock was up about 55% from its summer 2024 lows.Investors are still waiting to see how the self-driving ride-hailing market works, but it doesn't have to be a winner-take-all market. For starters, fleets of cars are expensive. Musk believes one of Tesla's key advantages is all the car buyers who have already paid for Teslas. Having a partner like Uber could lower capital costs for Waymo, or even for Tesla.There is also something to be said for the Uber brand. ""Uber"" has essentially become the verb for using a ride-hailing service.Musk's comments might have surprised investors, a little, eliminating any small price premium reflecting the long odds of a buyout.The challenge now is to understand and assess the development of the robo-taxi market in the coming years, and then to pick winners and losers.Uber is valued at $190 billion, more than General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis combined. Tesla is valued north of $1 trillion.Exactly how much is related to robo-taxis is hard to say. Most bullish Tesla analysts say a majority of the value is due to Tesla's AI expertise, which teaches cars to drive themselves.Alphabet, which controls Waymo, is valued at $2 trillion. How much Waymo of that represents is hard to say. Most of Alphabet's money still comes from Google's search business. Still, Waymo's progress has been substantial. It completes more than 250,000 driverless rides a week and announced Tuesday it had passed 10 million fully autonomous paid rides.It is safe to say there are hundreds of billions, even trillions, of value at stake in driverless cars. That is a large enough market to keep investors optimistic about Uber.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Wolfspeed was aiming to work out a Chapter 11 plan that has support of a majority of its creditors.Tesla fell 2.7%. CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday indicated he was committed to the electric-vehicle company. The chief executive told a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, and also said he would step back from political spending. Musk also told CNBC in an interview that Tesla was on track for a June launch of robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, adding the rollout would be slow.Nvidia was down 1.9%.

Tesla Stock Drops. Its Self-Driving Cars May Not Be Self Driving After All. — Barrons.com,1747858560000,"Al RootTesla stock rose early Wednesday but couldn't hold gains, and shares sold off with the market. Still, it's been a strong May for shares. Comments Elon Musk made on Tuesday show just how important June will be for the shares.One surprise from Musk, however, is that Tesla's first self-driving taxis might not be as self-driving as investors expect.Tesla stock traded as high as $347.25 but closed at $334.62, down 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Last week, Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber in Austin, Texas. Musk confirmed that Tesla plans to start robo-taxi service in the city by the end of June. He also indicated that there would be a small number of cars initially, humans would supervise operations, and the self-driving Teslas would only be able to go where the company was confident they could succeed.Having humans oversee and potentially intervene as tele0perators might not be exactly what investors expected for a robotaxi service, though. Musk has his reasons. ""We're going to be extremely paranoid about deployment, as we should.""""It's prudent for us to start with a small number,"" he added. That could be as low as 10. The goal is to be at a thousand in a few months and ""hundreds of thousands"" by the end of 2026. Any Tesla that has the correct hardware can become a robo-taxi when the AI-trained self-driving software gets good enough. At that point, Tesla owners can elect to use their vehicles to make money in the robo-taxi network when they aren't using their vehicles.That's the goal, anyway. Musk also reiterated his expectation that Tesla could license its technology to other auto makers. Seeing Teslas drive themselves in Austin successfully could be a catalyst for a deal.Musk also addressed self-driving technology competition with BYD. He's confident Tesla has a superior product, citing local independent testing.Earlier on Tuesday, via video at a conference in Qatar, Musk also said that he expects to be CEO in five years — and he had a lot to say. Musk said he would spend less time in Washington, D.C., in April, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He added that he expects to reduce his political spending. The reduction can have a significant impact on 2025 midterm races,"" says Carl Tobias, Williams Chair at the University of Richmond Law School. He hopes Musk's D.C. departure will reduce or end some of the ""destructive activity"" undertaken by DOGE. Investors hope less politics can help heal any brand damage from Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration.Musk stepping back from politics and speaking positively about this company and Tesla's AI technology are to be expected. Still, it's what investors wanted to hear — now Musk needs to deliver.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla's Robotaxi Revolution: Is it Too Late to Buy the Stock?,1747842900000,"Robotaxi is a word that once was the exclusive to the world of science fiction. As it turns out, Demolition Man is about to manifest itself in reality. Elon Musk revealed that Tesla ( TSLA ) is going to begin deploying self-driving taxi cabs to the streets of the US. It’s only a matter of time before transportation as a whole is drastically changed forever. The democratization of getting from point A to point B. Henry Ford is blushing somewhere.Of course, I understand that Elon isn’t everybody’s favorite anymore. Political motivations have created diverging feelings amongst us. For those that know me, at this point you realize that I couldn’t care less about politics. In my opinion, it’s theatre, sensationalized to evoke your emotions and get you to click and share articles. Here, I want to look at the inner workings of Tesla’s chart and try to figure out where the next moves might run into trouble.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Tesla’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70b91188a094b:0-tesla-s-robotaxi-revolution-is-it-too-late-to-buy-the-stock/
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Tesla (TSLA) and xAI Expand GPU Buildout Plans,1747831177000,"Tesla (TSLA, Financials) and xAI are expanding their artificial intelligence infrastructure, with Elon Musk confirming continued chip purchases from Nvidia and AMD. xAI has already deployed 200,000 GPUs at its Memphis-based Colossus facility, with plans for a tenfold expansion.xAI's Colossus facility currently runs more than 200,000 GPUs. Musk said it is the most powerful training cluster in the world right now and announced plans to build a 1 million-GPU center nearby.Musk acknowledged that xAI received priority GPU shipments over Tesla in 2024. Tesla's own Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, continues to train Autopilot and Optimus robotics software.Environmental concerns are rising in Memphis, with reports of Clean Air Act violations linked to gas turbines used to power Colossus. These turbines emit nitrogen oxides tied to respiratory illness and ozone formation.Musk forecast that while chips remain the bottleneck for AI now, a shortage of electrical generation capacity could emerge by mid-2026. He added that U.S. innovation leads China, despite China's higher infrastructure investments.xAI spent $191 million in 2024 and another $36.8 million through February 2025 on Tesla Megapacks for energy storage.

General Motors Ceases Vehicle Exports to China From the United States,1747829160000,"General Motors Company GM last week informed its employees and dealers involved in its China export operations that it will no longer ship vehicles from the United States to China. This decision comes amid ongoing trade and tariff negotiations between the United States and China.GM had been exporting vehicles to China through its premium import brand, The Durant Guild, which accounted for less than 0.1% of its total sales in the country, per a company spokesperson. Due to major shifts in economic conditions, GM has decided to restructure the Durant Guild and streamline its operations in China. Previously, U.S.-made goods imported into China were subject to tariffs exceeding 100%, though these were temporarily reduced as part of a 90-day agreement between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2025, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 442,000 vehicles in China, marking year-over-year sales growth and the third straight quarter of increasing market share. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, jumped 53.2% compared to the same period last year. GM, which already offers the most extensive NEV lineup among global automakers in China, plans to expand its portfolio further in 2025 by introducing extended-range electric vehicles, ensuring at least one NEV option for every new locally launched model. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .In April, GM’s rival, Ford Motor Company F, paused shipments of several U.S.-built vehicles, including the F-150 Raptor, Mustang, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator, to China due to retaliatory tariffs that pushed import taxes as high as 150%. Ford is considered one of the automakers most capable of handling tariffs, as roughly 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built domestically. However, Ford may still increase prices on new vehicles if tariff woes deepen.Last month, Tesla, Inc. TSLA also halted new orders for its Model S and Model X on its Chinese website after China increased tariffs on U.S. imports. New orders for both Tesla models were also no longer accessible through the automaker's WeChat mini program in China. Rising competition from BYD and other domestic manufacturers has also hurt Tesla's sales in China.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:10ffb6a71094b:0-general-motors-ceases-vehicle-exports-to-china-from-the-united-states/
China's BYD turns up heat in Europe with launch of Dolphin Surf EV,1747827863000,"Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD's SZSE:002594 low-cost Dolphin Surf became its 10th model available in Europe on Wednesday, with the Berlin launch increasing pressure on European rivals to produce more affordable alternatives.The car will sell at three price points, from 22,990 euros ($26,100) for a 322-kilometre (200-mile) range, to 24,990 euros for a 507-kilometre range.Until the end of June, the three versions will be available at a discounted price of 19,990-24,990 euros, sales chief Patrick Schulz said on Wednesday.The car piles pressure on European automakers to offer more affordable electric alternatives, with cost still a major barrier to wider adoption of EVs.Only a handful of models, such as the Dacia Spring or Leapmotor's T03, are on sale in Europe for under 20,000 euros, although 11 new models priced under 25,000 euros will go on sale this year, including Volkswagen's XETR:VOW ID.2, the Renault R5, the Fiat Grand Panda, and the Hyundai Inster.""The compact segment is the next frontier for electrification in Europe,"" Maria Grazia Davino, BYD regional managing director for markets including Germany, said in Berlin. ""We think this market has huge potential.""The Chinese version of the vehicle, the Seagull, has fuelled BYD's exponential rise in China, second only to Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA Model Y in total sales in 2024 with over 442,000 registrations.Globally, sales of the model have risen 45% this year so far to 170,000, BYD said on Wednesday.BYD, which last year surpassed Tesla to become the world's largest EV manufacturer, is overhauling its European operations, widening its dealer network, offering more hybrids and hiring managers with local experience, after early stumbles in the region stymied sales.Sales data indicates the revamp is working. In Germany, sales reached 2,791 in the first four months of the year, data from Germany's motor authority KBA showed, fast approaching the 2,891 vehicles it sold all year in 2024.That success is mirrored across Europe, where sales quadrupled in the first quarter to 37,201 cars, in sharp contrast to Tesla's sales, which plunged 37.2%.BYD will enter 12 new markets in Europe this year, Davino said, with sales locations to expand to over 1,000.($1 = 0.8808 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RT0SI:0-china-s-byd-turns-up-heat-in-europe-with-launch-of-dolphin-surf-ev/"
Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day.

Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help.

"TSLA: Tesla Stock Gains as Elon Musk Vows to Bet Less on Politics, Focus on Business",1747816255000,"Billionaire CEO spoke at a Qatar conference, saying he planned to still be the Tesla boss five years from now. Shares were the only bright spot in the Big Tech realm. 🚗 Breaking Away from Mag 7 Slump- Tesla stock NASDAQ:TSLA bucked the broader Big Tech, Mag 7 slump on Tuesday, as CEO Elon Musk told a global audience he’s stepping back from political spending to refocus on the business. Speaking via video at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk said he plans to reduce his involvement in US politics — at least for now, at least financially. - “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said. “I think I’ve done enough.” - Estimates show that the billionaire-turned-unelected-politician spent as much as $300 million backing President Trump’s 2024 campaign, emerging as one of the biggest individual political contributors of the cycle. But right now, Musk says he sees “no reason” to continue funding political efforts unless something changes. 📣 Musk Seeks More Control of Tesla- In addition to dialing down his political bets, Musk made it clear he’s sticking with Tesla — and doesn’t plan on leaving anytime soon. Asked if he’d still be Tesla CEO in five years, he answered simply, “Yes,” before adding, “Well, I might die.” - In characteristic fashion, Musk added a dose of nuance to his long-term commitment: he wants voting control to avoid being kicked out by activist shareholders. Later on Tuesday in a CNBC interview, Musk said he’s aiming to increase his stake in Tesla to 25%, up from the 12.77% he currently holds — a position worth over $140 billion. - “That’s the number I’d feel comfortable at, because that’s where I have some control, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out,” Musk explained. “If I’m destroying the value of the company or if I’ve just gone flat-out crazy,” he added, “they could still remove me.” 🤫 Wall Street’s Nod of Approval- Shares of the EV maker rose during a session that saw most of the tech sector in the red. Investors appeared to appreciate Musk’s recommitment to Tesla’s future and his hint at stepping away from politics — a topic that’s drawn controversy and criticism from some shareholders and the broader public. - Less drama and more deliveries? Sounds like a plan, maybe. Especially when looking ahead to the planned robotaxi launch.

Tesla (TSLA) Faces Scrutiny as Morgan Stanley Flags Valuation Gaps,1747777368000,"Tesla (TSLA, Financials) continues to draw scrutiny from Wall Street as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said the company's valuation is increasingly difficult to justify, even after 15 years on the public market.Tesla trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 181.98x, well above most growth stocks. The stock is up more than 95% over the past 12 months but has declined 15% so far in 2025. According to TipRanks data cited in the report, much of Tesla's valuation rests on opaque or pre-commercialized business segments.Jonas maintains a Buy rating with a $410 price target, suggesting nearly 20% upside. But he said most investors continue to evaluate Tesla solely based on its electric vehicle unitassigning just $50$100 per share to that segmentwhile overlooking other high-potential verticals.Morgan Stanley's sum-of-the-parts model gives significant weight to Tesla's energy storage, robotaxi, and humanoid robot businesses. Jonas estimates the energy storage segment alone is worth $67 per share, excluding future recurring revenues.The autonomous Cybercab service is expected to launch in Austin next month with 10 to 20 vehicles. Additionally, Jonas projected that Tesla's Optimus robot, if it replaces just 1% of global human labor, could add over $300 billion in valueor about $100 per share.Jonas argued that investors' narrow focus is equivalent to valuing Amazon (AMZN, Financials) solely as a retailer or Apple (AAPL, Financials) only as a device company, missing the broader innovation ecosystem.Investors should monitor Tesla's upcoming robotaxi rollout and a potential Optimus event later in 2025 as catalysts that could reshape the company's valuation narrative.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:77874274c094b:0-tesla-tsla-faces-scrutiny-as-morgan-stanley-flags-valuation-gaps/

Elon Musk to Cut Back Political Spending — WSJ,1747774320000,"By Eliot Brown, Tali Arbel and Joseph PisaniElon Musk says he plans to cut back on political spending, after making huge donations in the 2024 election to boost President Trump.""In terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" he said in a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. ""I think I've done enough.""Musk, the world's richest person, who according to filings spent close to $300 million in 2024 to help Trump and other Republicans, indicated he still could increase spending again if conditions change.""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it, "" he said. ""I do not currently see a reason.""Musk played a polarizing role in the early weeks of the Trump administration, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency as it slashed federal spending and jobs.In April, Musk said he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla, his electric-vehicle company. Investors had grown worried that he had taken his eye off the ball, with Tesla's sales and share price dropping during his time in the White House.On Tuesday, asked if he would still be chief executive of Tesla in five years, Musk said, ""Yes."" He then added a caveat, saying, ""Well, I might die.""The Wall Street Journal recently reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tesla board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla's next CEO. The board members, concerned that Musk was spending too much time in Washington, told him he needed to spend more time on Tesla.Tesla later issued a denial and Musk criticized the article on X, his social-media platform.Musk said during the Qatar forum that he wanted enough voting control in Tesla that he can't be ousted by activist investors. He clarified in a CNBC interview later Tuesday that he would want to up his stake in the company to 25%.""That's the number I'd feel comfortable at, because that's where I have some control, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out,"" Musk said, adding that he could still be removed ""if I'm destroying the value of the company or if I've just gone flat-out crazy.""Musk currently owns a 12.77% stake in Tesla, worth more than $140 billion, according to FactSet.Musk shrugged off declining Tesla sales — deliveries fell 13% in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier — saying that while the company had lost some liberal customers over his prominent role in the Trump administration, it had gained others among his political supporters.""Our sales are doing well at this point,"" he said. ""It's already turned around.""Last month when Tesla reported first-quarter earnings, the electric-vehicle maker's net income fell by 71%, in part, on weaker demand .In the CNBC interview, Musk said Tesla was ""seeing a major rebound in demand"" and brushed off concerns about consumer reaction to his political activities. ""When you buy a product, I mean how much do you care about the political views of the CEO?""Musk also said that he expected a handful of autonomous robotaxis would be on roads in Austin, Texas, by the end of June. From there, Tesla will expand to other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. He predicted by year's end there will be hundreds of thousands of self-driving Teslas in the U.S., though not specifically robotaxis.After initially planning to stay out of the 2024 election, Musk became one of the largest individual donors in U.S. election history. Musk then turned his sights to the state level, pouring more than $23 million into a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race in April to boost a Republican-backed candidate. But the effort resulted in a loss — the liberal candidate won.Musk dismissed potential conflicts of interest in his role as a top adviser to Trump and his extensive business interests, which include SpaceX, a leading commercial space-exploration company and government contractor, and xAI, an artificial-intelligence startup.""I have not seen any case where there has been an accusation of conflict, "" he said, adding that his work is only advisory — leaving it up to others in the administration to choose whether to enact his suggested cuts.When asked on Tuesday about the Journal's reporting last year that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin since late 2022, Musk said he spoke to the Russian president once.

Cantor Sees Tesla Ahead of Lucid,1747774235000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA overtakes Lucid in Cantor's EV showdown, driven by scale advantages and a pipeline of near-term catalysts. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard favors Tesla over Lucid NASDAQ:LCID as the better U.S. EV play, citing Tesla's $1.1 trillion market capover four times Toyota'sversus Lucid's much smaller footprint.Tesla's first quarter underscored both headwinds and strengths: automotive revenue slid 9.2 % year-over-year to $14 billion, dragging total top-line to $19.34 billion and missing consensus by over $2 billion, while energy generation and storage revenues jumped 67 % to $2.73 billion. EPS came in at $0.27, $0.15 below forecasts, yet shares have rallied about 47 % since the April 22 report on easing tariff tensions and Musk's pledge to refocus on Tesla. Lucid, by contrast, remains unprofitable and far smaller in deliveries and scale.Sheppard's bullish case rests on a slate of catalysts: next month's Robotaxi launch in Texas; a lower-priced $30,000 model debut in H1 25; ongoing Full Self-Driving rollouts in China and planned European launches; Optimus humanoid robot production in 2026 with customer deliveries by 2027; and the long-awaited Semi Truck entering production in 2026. He also highlighted Musk's commitment to dial back on Dogecoin distractions and double down on Tesla operations.Why It Matters: Tesla's combination of scale, diversified revenue streams and a clear catalyst roadmap contrasts with Lucid's smaller, cash-burning model, positioning TSLA to capture the next leg of EV growth.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:31c5f1152094b:0-cantor-sees-tesla-ahead-of-lucid/
Tim Higgins: Angry Elon Is Back. That's Good for Tesla. — WSJ,1748079000000,"By Tim HigginsListening to Elon Musk these days is to hear a man who feels unfairly treated.And, as he skulks away from the White House with his tail between his legs, he is particularly thin skinned. Angry that he was cast as a Nazi. Angry that some used his politics as an excuse to attack Tesla. Angry that he's being scrutinized.We've seen this before. Musk has always had an incredibly large chip on his shoulder — one fueled by perceived slights and personal grievances, critics expressing disbelief and the chorus of social-media doubters.But history has shown that it can unleash something fierce: Angry Elon. Like the Incredible Hulk busting out of his britches and turning green, Musk goes silent before exploding. These days, Musk again seems to be fuming, his eyes darting upward, his vision clouded red with anger.And Angry Elon could be a very good thing for Tesla investors. It can focus him on executing, on proving everyone wrong. A Musk that executes can go to outer space, can make electric cars mainstream.But investors haven't seen Musk execute in a while.Instead, they've seen promises of a cheap Tesla that would fuel 20 million annual vehicle sales seemingly abandoned. They've seen the Cybertruck flop. They've seen profitability shrink and sales fall for the first time in more than a decade.Worrisome stuff to investors concerned Musk has been too distracted in Washington. Even board members appeared unnerved.But fans remembering the power of Angry Elon drew hope from signs this past week that he might be back. First, via video link to a conference in Qatar, Musk on Tuesday delivered salty answer after salty answer to concerns about the state of his companies.Asked when he might be able to turn things around at Tesla, the chief executive replied, ""It's already turned around.""Musk's proof point? Essentially, the age-old retort by Tesla fans on social media: The stock price, bro!Since announcing on April 22 that he would pare back his time in the Trump administration, Tesla shares have risen 43%. This returned the automaker to the rarefied status of being valued at slightly more than $1 trillion. Overall, those shares are still down both 11% year-to-date and 29% from an all-time high.Analysts estimate Tesla unit sales will finish the year down from 2024. This is a reversal from just a few months ago when they expected year-over-year gains.Musk's vision for the future of Tesla isn't bothered by the boring part of selling electric vehicles. Instead, his future is all about ushering in a new era of robotics — driverless cars and humanoid robots.For roughly a decade, he has said the day was near for Tesla's autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon.com's Zoox have put fully autonomous cars on public roads.On Tuesday, Musk doubled down in a second public appearance, this time on CNBC, reaffirming that Tesla is on track to begin offering driverless cars in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.The plan, he said, is to begin with probably 10 vehicles on the road in the first week, then increase that figure by tens of vehicles each week and probably reach 1,000 within a few months. He added that there would probably be hundreds of thousands of autonomous Tesla vehicles by the end of next year, if not more than one million.It's the kind of ultra-ambitious targets he has promoted before. He just needs to execute.During the CNBC interview, his recent track record in Washington was questioned and he snapped again: ""Why are you attacking this, given that we've made so much progress?""Even as he defended his DOGE efforts, Musk has begun amplifying the idea that he is stepping back from politics after realizing the Republican-controlled Congress lacks the appetite to implement spending reductions. ""I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential,"" he posted Friday.

Correction to EV Battery Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs — Barrons.com,1747773720000,"Al RootShares of battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at 263 Hong Kong dollars apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750.""The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It is stepping on the power while Honda is hitting the brakes.Tuesday, Honda said it would ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend Yen10 trillion, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by Yen3 trillion, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda's U.S.-listed American depositary receipts rose 1.2% to $29.62, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach, but also welcome the idea that the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It is also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

The Food and Drug Administration will stick to its existing process for updating Covid-19 shots for older adults and those at a high risk of severe illness. It's a softer approach than Trump officials had seemed poised to take, according to Barron's reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis.Home Depot, the biggest home-improvement retailer, reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.56 a share, missing analysts' estimates of $3.60. Revenue of $39.9 billion beat forecasts of $39.3 billion. The company said it plans to keep prices unchanged despite new tariffs. Home Depot shares were down 0.6%. Competitor Lowe's, which reports quarterly earnings Wednesday, fell 1.4%.Tesla was up 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk told a conference in Qatar that he expects to still be chief executive in five years, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla shares have declined 15% this year but have jumped about 44% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 22. Tesla sold 11,150 cars in China the past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung, up from 3,040 sold the week before. But that is down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Shares of Tesla supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology, the Chinese battery giant, soared 16% in their Hong Kong debut on Tuesday. CATL raised almost $4.6 billion in the world's largest equity offering this year.UnitedHealth gained 1.8%. The shares rose 8.2% on Monday, ending the session at $315.89. It was the stock's largest daily percentage increase since Nov 4, 2020, when it rose more than 10%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock declined 23.3% last week after UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty resigned and the company suspended its 2025 outlook.Nvidia fell 0.9%. CEO Jensen Huang said Monday the company would be opening its artificial-intelligence server platform to rival chip makers but he also warned the U.S. government's move to limit chip exports to China could hit revenue by $15 billion.D-Wave Quantum jumped 26% as its sixth-generation quantum-computing system became available over the cloud. D-Wave management highlighted the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines effectively can handle.Amer Sports rose 19% after the sporting goods and apparel company topped first-quarter adjusted earnings estimates and raised fiscal-year profit guidance.Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained 1.5% to $17.72 after analysts at Evercore ISI upgraded shares of the technology company to Outperform from In Line and raised their price target to $22 from $17.Viking Holdings, the expedition cruises company, reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss on a revenue jump of 25% to $897.1 million. The company said it was seeing ""sustained strength in demand."" Shares, however, declined 5% as analysts questioned whether Viking will be able to sustain pricing growth as the year progresses. Cruise line peers also declined. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings was off 3.9%, Carnival fell 2.1%, and Royal Caribbean was down 1.9%.Earnings reports were expected after the closing bell Tuesday from Palo Alto Networks, Keysight Technologies, and Toll Brothers.Write to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Shares of the electric-vehicle company closed up 1.9% on Thursday, even as the Trump tax-and-spending bill that was passed by the House of Representatives included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay annual fees, while the Republican-led Senate voted to revoke a California measure that banned the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. On Friday, Wedbush analysts maintained their Outperform rating on the stock and raised their price target to $500 from $350.Intuit, the owner of TurboTax and Credit Karma, rose 8% after boosting its fiscal-year outlook following stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. The company expects fiscal-year revenue of $18.72 billion to $18.76 billion, an increase of 15% from a year earlier compared with previous guidance that called for a revenue jump of 12% to 13%.Workday reported first-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates as subscription revenue rose 13% to about $2.06 billion. The software company said it anticipates second-quarter subscription revenue of $2.16 billion — up nearly 14% from a year earlier, but slightly below forecasts.

Trump Tax Bill Could 'Devastate' Clean Energy. Here Are the Few Bright Spots. — Barrons.com,1748027340000,"By Avi SalzmanInvestors knew that President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would be bad for clean energy. Subsidies for projects like solar and wind farms were bound to be gutted to pay for tax cuts. But the bill that passed the House of Representatives on Thursday was worse than most of them expected.There's a very gloomy future ahead in some areas if the bill isn't changed dramatically in the Senate.""This bill is going to be devastating to the industry if it's passed by the Senate,"" said Heather Cooper, a lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery who works with clean energy companies. ""It takes the tax credits that have been in the code for decades, and that were extended and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act, and it essentially repeals pretty much all of those incentives almost immediately for almost all types of projects.""Cooper said her clients were ""jaw-dropped and dumbfounded that this went through.""""This is a highly robust industry with hundreds of thousands of workers and employees,"" she said. A Princeton University analysis found that the bill almost entirely repeals the Inflation Reduction Act, which would jeopardize more than $500 billion of already-announced clean energy manufacturing projects.Cooper's clients are hopeful that the Senate will change the bill significantly, but she's less optimistic.Certain clean energy industries would get hit harder than others. The worst-hit areas appear to be rooftop solar and electric vehicles, which would quickly lose financial support that they had counted on for years. Areas that appear to have survived with less damage include biofuels, nuclear energy, and carbon capture. But all of those industries have their own problems beyond the bill.Rooftop solarThe bill removes a rooftop solar tax credit that allowed homeowners to take a credit worth 30% of the value of the project. It also limits how companies that lease solar panels to consumers can claim tax credits — an unexpected change that would have a particularly dramatic effect on SunRun, the leader in that industry. It also forbids companies from selling the tax credits to other buyers, taking away a mechanism that had greased the wheels of the industry.SunRun stock fell 37% on Thursday. BMO Markets analyst Ameet Thakkar downgraded SunRun's shares to Underperform and predicted that there will be ""limited political will to claw back residential credits in any Senate version."" Sunnova, another company that leases solar panels to customers, warned investors earlier this year that there's a chance it will not be able to stay in business — even before this bill was finalized.Electric vehiclesMost kinds of EVs will lose access to $7,500 tax credits that will make them less price-competitive against gasoline-powered cars. The bill would also add new fees to buyers of certain low-emission vehicles, adding charges of $250 a year for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids. The EV boom had already begun to slow, but the new costs and loss of tax breaks will almost certainly slow sales further. Tesla may weather the changes better than peers who have a smaller customer base, but it could still be hurt.Utility-scale solarUtilities install large arrays of solar panels to generate electricity. The bill will quickly remove the tax credits they receive for installing them, making them less cost-competitive with fossil-fuel-powered generators, like natural gas plants. Clean energy projects would have to start up within 60 days of passage of the bill to still be eligible.Cooper said her clients who install panels are in a rush to get equipment and get projects started.""I suspect every module manufacturer has gotten 100 phone calls today,"" she said. ""There's gonna be a lot of activity as people scramble to engage in activities in the next 60-something days.""The changes could have an impact on big utility-scale installers like NextEra Energy and AES, whose stocks fell sharply Thursday. Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith downgraded AES stock to Underperform on Tuesday, citing its ""difficult path forward"".Clean energy manufacturingThe bill was mostly a negative for companies that manufacture clean energy products like batteries and solar panels in the United States. It will phase outthe credits supporting manufacturing more quickly than expected, and impose strict rules to forbid tax breaks to companies that rely on Chinese suppliers and other ""foreign entities of concern.""That's particularly bad for battery makers, who are heavily dependent on China. First Solar, which manufactures solar panels for utilities in the U.S., should benefit from the domestic manufacturing rules. But First Solar will likely be hurt by a drop in demand for solar because of the removal of tax credits available to utilities for installing it.WindWind power is and has been in a deep rut. The bill takes away its tax credits, and sunsets credits for wind manufacturing even faster than solar. Wind equipment companies like Vestas will have to rely on overseas business for now. The one bright spot is that the stocks were already beaten down, so they reflect very low expectations.BiofuelsCredits for the production of biofuels from plant and animal byproducts survived the House bill, and production credits were even extended by an extra year. Midwestern congressional representatives like those credits, which help farmers.That political support would seem to be a boon for biofuels players like Darling Industries, Calumet and Neste. But those companies have other problems right now that make them shaky investments, and have sent all the stocks lower this year. There simply isn't enough demand for biofuels, and they're not cost-competitive when gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices are cheap like they are today. Other Trump administration policies that pull back support for clean energy are also hurting the industry.NuclearCredits for nuclear energy mostly survived the House bill, though one crucial credit will fade away a year earlier than expected.Both Democrats and Republicans favor nuclear energy, and have called for a ""renaissance."" And the credits' survival is a good sign for owners of existing nuclear reactors, like Constellation Energy.A separate production tax credit available to nuclear power is only available to projects that start construction by the end of 2028 — a relatively short timeline for companies that can take many years to get all the permits and financing. And the tax credits don't solve the bigger problem for nuclear, which is finding utilities, lenders, and a customer base who are willing to take on the financial risk of developing new reactors. Until those issues are cleared up, start-ups like Oklo and Nuscale could still face challenges.Carbon captureThe bill also continues to support carbon capture, a process that involves siphoning off carbon emissions from industrial plants and oil wells, and then liquefying the carbon and storing it underground. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil have been investing in the area, and could profit off the credits. But demand for carbon capture is still scarce, and Trump's rollback of other environmental rules calls into question whether companies will continue to pursue low-carbon strategies.There also aren't many ways for investors to buy into the industry. Occidental Petroleum, the oil company that is farthest along in its carbon-capture efforts, has other problems that have sunk its stock in recent years, like high indebtedness.Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Elon Musk says ‘I don’t follow BYD’ — but the Chinese EV giant is hard to ignore,1747771607000,"“I don’t follow BYD” – that’s what Elon Musk said in a recent interview with CNBC.The billionaire chief executive of Tesla Inc NASDAQ:TSLA also went on to state that he doesn’t think about competitors at all. His entire focus is solely on making the TSLA product as perfect as humanly possible.While the aforementioned comment reflects Musk’s commitment to innovation, ignoring rivals, particularly BYD, could prove a misstep on his part. Here’s why.BYD’s market dominanceBYD has already surpassed Tesla Inc to become the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles – and that’s when it doesn’t even sell its vehicles in the world’s second-largest auto market, the US.While the multinational based out of Austin, Texas, was once the undisputed leader in the EV space, BYD’s rapid expansion, including the assembly lines it has already established in Brazil, Hungary, Thailand, and Uzbekistan, signals its intent to dominate globally.Elon Musk himself acknowledged recently that without trade barriers, BYD could “demolish most other car companies.” So, if Tesla doesn’t track BYD’s moves, it could end up losing ground in key markets.BYD’s cost advantageBYD’s ability to produce EVs at significantly lower costs is a major threat to Tesla Inc. In fact, experts are now convinced that “no one can match BYD on price, period.”Tesla’s premium pricing strategy works in some markets, but affordability is a key driver of mass adoption. Therefore, if the US electric vehicles behemoth doesn’t analyse BYD’s cost-saving strategies, it may struggle to compete in price-sensitive regions.That’s part of the reason why TSLA is already finding it incrementally more difficult to expand its share in China, which, according to Elon Musk, is “the most competitive auto market.”BYD’s technological advancementsBYD has established itself globally as much more than just a budget EV maker with innovations that sometimes seem light years ahead of its rivals.But if he still ignores BYD’s tech advancements, TSLA risks being blindsided by innovations that could redefine the market.

Tesla Slides as Grok Rolls Into Federal Agencies,1748016227000,"Shares of Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA fell nearly 1% after Reuters reported that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiencynicknamed DOGEhas begun using a customized version of its Grok chatbot across multiple federal departments, including Homeland Security, without formal agency approval. Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters the aim is to sift data and auto-generate reports, with Grok launched by Musk's xAI in 2023. Analysts warn this unvetted deployment may breach long-standing privacy safeguards and give Musk unfair access to nonpublic federal contracting information. Two of the sources said DOGE staff pushed DHS officials to adopt Grok, even though it hasn't been vetted; it's unclear what specific datasets have been fed into the system.

Elon Musk Shores Up Tesla Leadership and Starlink Plans,1747769704000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA commits Musk's five-year horizon, teases Starlink IPO prospects. Tesla vows Elon Musk will remain CEO through 2030, providing more definitive leadership visibility amid concerns over his political engagements and time split with SpaceX and the Trump Administration.Despite personal blowback from his interventionist statements, Musk said he did what needed to be done, noting that the brand has offset some political fallout with additional sales from right-leaning buyers, even as delivery reports have shown steep declines in North America and Europe. He plans to dial back political spending after forthcoming election defeats and defended his dual roles, underscoring that his commitment to Tesla is ironclad over the next five years.On the SpaceX front, Musk added that Starlink may pursue an IPO eventually, though he's in no rush, highlighting growing confidence in the satellite-internet business after adding roughly 2 million subscribers worldwide. He also confirmed he'll press ahead with his lawsuit against OpenAI, despite the AI pioneer partially reversing its for-profit restructuring plan. Musk's remarks come as investors and analysts grapple with how his political profile and multi-company leadership might influence brand perception and operational focus.Why It Matters: Locking in Musk's CEO tenure for another half-decade reduces one major uncertainty for investors, while Starlink's eventual public listing could unlock substantial value outside Tesla. Tesla stock has taken a hit, with analysts' average 12-month target now at $285.79 that's an 18.6% downside from current levels. The spread is wild though: some see it heading as high as $452, while others think it could crater to just $19. That kind of divergence screams uncertainty.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his right-wing political views and his work for U.S. President Donald Trump. Musk has said he will reduce his work for Trump and focus on Tesla. ""My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days, every few weeks, and to be helpful where I can be helpful,"" he said. A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.""The only things that matter in the long term are autonomy and Optimus,"" Musk told CNBC.Autonomous vehicle technology has been hard to commercialize, with tight regulations and heavy investments forcing many companies to give up. Those still in the race, including Alphabet's Waymo, have faced increased scrutiny.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating collisions involving Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance software in reduced roadway visibility conditions since October. The U.S. road safety regulator asked Tesla last week to answer questions on its paid robotaxi service launch to assess how the cars will perform in poor weather.Tesla is in talks with major automakers to license the FSD software that is expected to underpin its robotaxis, Musk said.To power his broader artificial intelligence vision, Musk's xAI startup has been ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models, and its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called ""Colossus,"" is touted as the world's largest. xAI will deploy a million of Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA advanced Blackwell chips at a new facility near Memphis, Musk said. ""So long as Nvidia is better than what we make, we'll keep buying from Nvidia,"" he said. xAI bought a 1-million -square-foot property in Southwest Memphis, Tennessee, the Greater Memphis Chamber said in March.

Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

"Elon Musk Drops Bombshell: Staying at Tesla, Ditching Politics--Stock Reacts Fast",1747768870000,"Elon Musk wants you to know he's not going anywhere. In a remote appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum, the Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA CEO said he plans to lead the company for at least another five years a much-needed dose of reassurance for shareholders rattled by sliding sales and courtroom drama around his scrapped $56 billion pay package. Musk also made it clear: this isn't about the money. It's a reasonable control thing, he said, pushing back on the idea that his push for more Tesla shares is rooted in wealth accumulation.On the business front, Musk downplayed Tesla's recent stumbles, claiming the company's downturn has already turned around. While sales remain weak in Europe, he argued other regions are holding strong and doesn't expect any meaningful shortfall. Investors seemed to like the optimism Tesla shares popped 2.4% at 12.38pm. That bounce offers a breather after the stock shed 14% this year amid concerns about EV demand, pricing pressure, and leadership distractions.Musk also addressed the elephant in the room: his politics. He admitted past political spending may have hurt Tesla's appeal on the left, but claimed it gained support elsewhere. Looking ahead, Musk said he plans to spend a lot less on politics, signaling a shift back toward focus and execution. His parting message?

"Tariff crossfire hits Toyota, Nissan, Ford suppliers in Japan",1747967270000,"Four decades ago, Hiroko Suzuki's father threaded the needle of a U.S. trade war by pushing the family auto-parts business into newer niche products. Now, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are so sweeping they threaten her own attempt to diversify the 78-year-old company into medical devices.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has called the U.S. tariffs, including 25% on automobiles, a ""national crisis"" for the world's fourth-largest economy. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, headed to Washington on Friday for a third round of talks.The worry is evident at companies like Kyowa Industrial, a maker of prototype parts and race-car components based in Takasaki, north of Tokyo. Kyowa, which employs 120 people, was among six auto suppliers that told Reuters they were concerned about their ability to withstand the tariff pressure on Japan's car industry.""What in the world are we going to do?"" Suzuki, Kyowa's third-generation president, recalled thinking when the tariffs were announced. ""This is going to be bad."" The problems Kyowa and other auto suppliers face illustrate a decades-long shift in Japan, which no longer floods the world with chips and consumer electronics and is reliant on an auto industry threatened by intense Chinese competition. That marks a contrast with the 1980s, when the U.S. slapped trade barriers on a rising Japan and its then-barnstorming exports.This report, which is based on interviews with a dozen people, including industry executives, bankers and senior government officials, provides a first-hand account of how one firm is grappling with the uncertainty, and details the deepening squeeze on the automotive supply chain at a time of profound disruption.Kyowa and thousands of other small manufacturers comprise an auto-supply network that has for decades pursued a ""monozukuri"" (literally, ""making things"") approach to production. That culture of incremental improvement and assembly-line efficiency, based on methods developed by Toyota, helped make Japan a juggernaut. But the shift to battery-powered smart cars has meant software, in which EV makers such as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and China's BYD SZSE:002594 excel, has become a bigger selling point.Kyowa started developing neurosurgery instruments in 2016 after Suzuki, now 65, realised the rise of EVs would eventually hammer demand for engine components. It began selling the instruments in the U.S. last year, only to find that Trump's tariffs also applied to medical devices.Kyowa doesn't export auto components to the U.S., but Suzuki worries automakers will force suppliers to cut prices to offset tariffs. So far, that hasn't happened to her.One Subaru Corp TSE:7270 supplier said his company may have to start looking for partners expanding outside the U.S. Major automakers have largely offered muted support for suppliers since Trump's tariff announcements. Last month, Toyota TSE:7203 , Nissan TSE:7201 and Ford NYSE:F sent letters to the U.S. arms of some Japanese suppliers asking for cooperation in the face of tariffs, according to copies reviewed by Reuters, without offering specifics.The letters haven't been previously reported.Nissan told suppliers they should stick to previously agreed prices. It said it was ""not obliged"" to bear the costs of tariffs but that it would shoulder some of the hit for up to four weeks to help secure its supply chain. It added that it could later seek to recover any support payments to suppliers.Reuters couldn't determine how much support, if any, Nissan extended. The automakers haven't sent follow-up letters, according to two suppliers, who allowed Reuters to review the correspondence on condition of anonymity.Nissan told Reuters it was working with suppliers to mitigate the tariff impact and contain costs, including through localisation.Toyota said it would seek to protect its suppliers, dealers, and employees while maintaining customers' trust as it navigated the uncertainty created by the tariffs. Ford told Reuters it was working with suppliers to assess their exposure and potentially reconfigure processes and sourcing. In its letter, Toyota said it understood the ""complexity and financial burden some suppliers are facing"" and asked suppliers to identify and share mitigation measures. Toyota would work with suppliers ""in good faith"", it said.Some Toyota suppliers, including Denso TSE:6902 , have not given earnings forecasts for the coming year, citing uncertainty.Julie Boote, an analyst at research firm Pelham Smithers Associates, said the trade war posed an ""emergency"" for Japan's auto industry that would hasten consolidation.""In order to survive, these automakers will have to work together,"" she said. SQUEEZED ON COSTJapanese manufacturers traditionally put pressure on smaller suppliers to lower prices, said Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member who is now a professor at Keio University. If the tariffs remain in place in the longer term, it would spell more damage for regional economies hollowed out by demographic decline, she said.The risks for Japan are already clear. The economy shrank in the first quarter, and Tokyo has compiled emergency economic measures to ease the pain of tariffs.""Automobile exports are just too important to Japan for a 25% tariff to stay in place,"" said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now a director at consulting firm Eurasia Group. Boling said the U.S. is unlikely to go below the 10% it agreed with Britain.Trump introduced a 25% tariff on automobiles and later a 24% tariff on all Japanese goods. The latter was slashed to 10% for 90 days, which runs out in July.Akazawa, the trade envoy, on Tuesday said Japan was sticking to its guns and wanted tariffs eliminated. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations.A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration wanted trading partners to align with U.S. efforts to achieve ""fairness and balance in our trading relationships and protect U.S. economic and national security.""Two senior Japanese officials told Reuters Japan's auto industry was increasingly looking like a laggard and needed to use the tariffs as an opportunity to implement sweeping changes to catch up with EV rivals.In a statement, the trade ministry said that regardless of U.S. tariffs, Japan's auto industry needed to respond to significant changes in the competitive environment.Japan's top auto suppliers, called Tier 1, procure parts from Tier 2 suppliers, and so on down the chain. At the bottom are firms that can be little more than neighbourhood workshops grinding out a single part.Government officials have previously urged smaller companies to innovate and consolidate, to gain scale.At regional lender Ashikaga Bank, an automotive industry team supports some 200 companies, around 80% of which are Tier 2 or lower suppliers. A member of the team not authorised to speak publicly said they worried tariffs would lead to higher vehicle prices and a decline in Japanese car sales in the U.S., hitting the bank's clients.Shinichi Iizuka, president of Toa Kogyo, a suspension maker in Subaru's hometown of Ota, near Takasaki, said the tariff burden will likely be shared by consumers, car dealers, automakers and suppliers. Some 70% of Subaru's car sales are in the U.S., where it relies on both local manufacturing and imports. On Monday, Subaru said it would raise prices on several U.S. models.Subaru CFO Shinsuke Toda this month said it was willing to talk with suppliers about sharing their burden, adding the situation remained unclear.IT'S PERSONALSuzuki's drive to diversify Kyowa Industrial into medical devices mirrors the pivot made by her father during the 1980s trade friction, when Kyowa ditched mass production of less-profitable auto parts to focus on higher-margin prototypes and racing-engine components. Suzuki took over in 2000 and her father died in 2013.Before Trump's tariffs, Suzuki had planned to build a U.S. track record in sales of medical equipment to smooth entry into other markets. With the advent of the U.S. trade barriers, she said her team considered moving production to the U.S., where costs are high, or shifting the sales focus to Asia.Given the uncertainty around Trump's announcements, Kyowa is in talks with potential distributors in Singapore and Hong Kong, Suzuki said.Around 70% of Kyowa's business still comes from automakers, while chip-equipment makers and Japan's space program contribute to the remainder. It supplies most Japanese car makers, General Motors NYSE:GM and parts for Formula One race cars.Annual sales are a modest 2 billion yen ($14 million). Still, Kyowa is larger than three-quarters of the roughly 68,000 companies that make up Japan's auto-supply chain, according to research firm Teikoku Databank. For Suzuki, trade friction is also personal, given her deep affection for the U.S. She grew up listening to rock music on U.S. armed forces radio, learned English and went to university in America. She remembers seeing Aerosmith live at their first concert in Japan.""Japan and America have a long history of friendship. I hope they can find a solution,"" she said.($1 = 145.0700 yen)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0FY:0-tariff-crossfire-hits-toyota-nissan-ford-suppliers-in-japan/"

Tesla's Emissions Credits Are at Risk After Senate's California Vote — Barrons.com,1747946340000,"Al RootCongress took another step to erode California's ability to regulate emissions affecting air quality, dealing a potentially significantly blow to Tesla's ability to profit from sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission vehicles.California has long had a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency that allowed it to regulate its own air quality. But on Thursday morning, the Senate voted to essentially eliminate that, using the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies.The California Air Resources Board, which sets emission policy for the state, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Democratic lawmakers warned that set a bad precedent for upending agency decisions. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Ron Wyden (D., Ore), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways.""That means Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.The vote is just one twist in a continuing fight over California emissions. California has successfully fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past, and it has support in the current battle.""Today, in an unprecedented and illegal attack on the nation's bedrock air quality law, the United States Senate passed Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions to block states from implementing policies to reduce cancer-causing pollution from motor vehicles,"" said CALSTART, a nonprofit advancing clean transportation technologies, in an emailed statement. ""Authorization for these policies has been a core component of the Clean Air Act for more than 50 years.""Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify a so-called waiver of preemption permitting California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations that the EPA had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that follow California's standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That is a tall order because EVs account for about 20% of California's new car sales today. They are only about 7% to 8% nationwide.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which includes General Motors and Ford Motor, supports rolling back the 2030 requirement.The California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's sales of zero-emission vehicle credits, which it receives because its all-electric fleet allows it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to auto makers that haven't met the targets have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California news. Tesla stock was up 3.6% in late Thursday trading, despite the vote, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.4%.One explanation for the move is that investors are increasingly viewing Tesla as an artificial-intelligence company than a car manufacturer. Investors are focusing on the company's plans to launch a robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June — an enterprise that depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to fully overturning the California system.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The vote is a win for General Motors NYSE:GM , Toyota TSE:7203 and other automakers that heavily lobbied against the rules and a blow to California and environmental groups that say the requirements are essential to ensuring cleaner vehicles and cutting pollution.California first announced a plan in 2020 to require that by 2035 at least 80% of new cars sold be electric and up to 20% plug-in hybrid models.""This Senate vote is illegal,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said, adding the Senate action would cost California taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in additional health care costs. ""We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.""Since 1970, California has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act.Senate Republicans rejected the advice of the parliamentarian in moving forward.

Tesla did not immediately comment. GM praised the vote, saying it would ""align emissions standards with today’s market realities.""The Senate separately voted Thursday to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks and to bar California's low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines.These are the latest actions in recent months taking aim at electric vehicles.A separate bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday would end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. It would also phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028.If upheld by the courts, rescinding California's rules will make it easier for automakers to delay or cancel some EV production. Automakers had warned in the coming months they might have been forced to limit gas-powered vehicles in some states.California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models.

Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities.The tokens' launch outside the U.S. comes amid growing interest in blending traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. While tokenized securities have yet to gain widespread adoption, proponents say they hold the potential to significantly reshape how people access and invest in financial markets.In a January opinion piece for the Washington Post, Robinhood NASDAQ:HOOD CEO Vlad Tenev said tokenization could also allow retail investors to access private companies' stocks. Kraken's tokens, called xStocks, will be available in select markets outside the United States, it said, without naming the markets.

Tesla Reportedly Loses Spot as Europe's Top EV Seller to BYD,1747918066000,"Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA Europe sales in April were exceeded by Chinese competitor BYD for the first time, multiple media reports said Thursday, citing market researcher Jato Dynamics.

Tesla Stock Drops. The 'Big Beautiful Bill' Is Big Trouble and There's Another Vote to Watch. — Barrons.com,1747917900000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling in early trading Thursday after the House of Representatives passed its tax-and-spend bill. And its not the only vote that matters Thursday.Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were off 1.9% at $328.39, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.The House passed its budget bill on Thursday, and it included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay $250 and $100 annual fees, respectively. It also terminated credits on most clean energy initiatives, including those for new and used electric vehicles. None of that is good Tesla.But there is another vote coming Thursday, this one in the Senate, which is voting on a Congressional Review Act measure Thursday designed to essentially eliminate a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency that lets California regulate its air emissions.The CRA can be used to overturn federal agency actions.It's a controversial step. For starters, California has been regulating its air quality since the late 1960s. And Republicans have maneuvered around Senate filibuster rules. Democrats aren't happy with the strategy. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways."" Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.However the vote turns out, it appears to be just one step in a lengthy fight over California emissions. California has fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past.The Senate vote isn't the first salvo from the Republican-controlled Congress. Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify the "" waiver of preemption"" for California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations, which the Environmental Protection Agency had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that have adopted California standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of California's new car sales today. EVs are only about 7% to 8% of nationwide new car sales.Changes could be a problem for Tesla because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California air quality news. Coming into Thursday trading, shares were up almost 19% in May.One explanation for the move is AI. Investors are thinking more about the company's plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. The success of that business depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to overturn the California system fully.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

BEV registrations surged 28% in April from last year, largely driven by Chinese car brands.Despite the EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, registrations of such cars increased 59% in the month from a year earlier, while carmakers from Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States recorded 26% growth. WEAK TESLA DEMANDThe company reported its first drop in annual deliveries last year, and analysts expect another fall this year after a 13% decline in the first quarter.Musk said earlier this week that Tesla had already turned around sales, and demand was strong in regions apart from Europe. His political views have triggered waves of protests against Tesla in the U.S. and Europe, leading to a slump in sales.Additionally, production halts to retool factories to make the redesigned Model Y crossover globally caused a drop in manufacturing and sales in the first quarter.Analysts have also attributed lower sales to customers waiting for less-expensive versions of the new Model Y, Tesla's best-selling vehicle, to become more widely available.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU0QZ:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time-report-says/"

""The Model Y is priced from 263,500 yuan ($36,574) and these (YU7) configurations should make the car 60,000-70,000 yuan more expensive,"" Lei said. ""But we'll talk about the price in July.""

The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics ,1747763100000,"Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we’ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the “World’s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.”As this trend gains traction, it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we’ll explore four stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), the Global X Robotics & AI ETF (BOTZ) and Tesla (TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolutionGrowth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it’s a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world’s most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla’s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia ,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia’s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank’s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don’t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfd373905094b:0-the-next-major-tech-stock-trend-humanoid-robotics/

EV Owners Face Annual Fee Under Proposed Tax Bill — Barrons.com,1747868640000,"Al RootThe latest version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill includes another hit to the electric vehicle industry.The legislation includes a provision for the Federal Highway Administration to impose a $250 annual fee on all-electric vehicles and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.The FHA helps build and maintain roads — and gets most of its money from gasoline taxes. With all-electric cars using no gas, EV drivers get (small) free lunch paid for by drivers of gas-guzzling vehicles.The free lunch might be less than drivers of gasoline-powered cars would guess, though. Already, 37 states collect annual EV fees ranging from $50 to $250 a year. The average is about $142, according to Atlas Public Policy. Some other states collect fees at public charging stations.As for traditional cars, the amount an average driver might contribute to the FHA's Highway Trust Fund is probably about $100 annually. The new law might seem a little punitive toward EVs, but EVs are a little heavier than gasoline-powered vehicles. More weight can equal more wear and tear on the roads.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents many auto makers in Washington, including General Motors and Ford Motor, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which isn't a part of the AAI, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The latest version of the bill also ends the $7,500 purchase tax credit for qualifying electric vehicles.And earlier this month, the House voted to strip California's ability to regulate its air quality. The House resolution would need Senate approval and the president's signature to become law.That legislation could be a problem because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.California is currently requiring that roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of new car sales today. The AAI supports a slackening of California EV regulation.Electric vehicles appear to be losing policy support on multiple fronts.

US Defense Secretary Hegseth meets Musk for second time at Pentagon,1747866002000,"U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met billionaire Elon Musk at the Pentagon on Wednesday, officials said, the second known time the close ally of President Donald Trump has visited the department's headquarters. In March, Musk, whose businesses have a number of Defense Department contracts, was granted an unprecedented top-level meeting at the Pentagon. ""The Secretary met with Elon Musk and other members of the X AI team this morning,"" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. ""The Department of Defense is committed to engaging with AI industry CEOs to ensure our warfighters are equipped to face 21st century threats,"" Parnell added.

Ahead of his first meeting in March, there was a media report that Musk would be briefed on secret war plans for China, something Musk, Trump and others denied. Musk, at the time, called the report ""pure propaganda"" and urged legal action against leakers. Musk's businesses Starlink and SpaceX already have a number of Pentagon contracts, raising questions about conflicts of interest as he advocates for innovation and re-prioritization of Pentagon spending to find efficiencies. Trump's planned Golden Dome missile defense shield, which would require hundreds of sensors and other satellites to keep watch for incoming ballistic missiles, would be a natural fit for SpaceX and its Starlink unit. The opportunities for his companies, SpaceX in particular, under Trump could drive billions of dollars of revenue to his firms. The White House has previously said Musk will recuse himself if any conflicts of interest arise between his business dealings and his role in cutting federal government spending. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has made cuts across the U.S. government, including at the Pentagon.Musk said on Tuesday he will cut his political spending substantially, the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT115:0-us-defense-secretary-hegseth-meets-musk-for-second-time-at-pentagon/"
US Senate to vote this week on bill to bar California 2035 EV plan,1747754111000,"The U.S. Senate plans to vote this week to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 that has been adopted by 11 other states, Majority Leader John Thune said on Tuesday.The U.S. House approved legislation on May 1 to repeal a waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December, allowing California to mandate at least 80% electric vehicles by 2035.Major automakers had urged the action, saying the rules are not feasible. California says the rules are essential to cut pollution and contends the vote is illegal.Thune said the action effectively imposes a stringent nationwide EV mandate because of California's size and other states adopting it. ""Automakers around the country would be forced to close down a significant part of their traditional vehicle production with serious consequences,"" Thune said. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors NYSE:GM Toyota TSE:7203 Volkswagen XETR:VOW Hyundai KRX:005380 and other major automakers has warned car companies could be ""forced to substantially reduce the number of overall vehicles for sale to inflate their proportion of electric vehicle sales."" The California Air Resources Board rules have been adopted by another 11 states, including New York, Massachusetts and Oregon accounting for nearly 40% of the U.S. auto market — but Vermont and Maryland have delayed compliance . The U.S. House separately voted earlier to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks. Democrats say the Senate is violating the rules by moving ahead. In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act, which only requires a majority of the U.S. Senate. California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models. Automakers say it is impossible for them to meet that figure given current EV sales, which are 10% or lower in some states adopting the rules. California says EVs must hit 68% of new vehicle sales by 2030. The U.S. Transportation Department is separately moving to undo aggressive fuel economy rules adopted by Biden and plans to declare that the Biden administration exceeded its authority in considering EVs when writing the rules.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RS0LJ:0-us-senate-to-vote-this-week-on-bill-to-bar-california-2035-ev-plan/"

Tesla's China Sales Stink. The Stock Is Rising Because of Musk. — Barrons.com,1747753320000,"Al RootTesla stock jumped early Tuesday despite more weak sales data. Comments from CEO Elon Musk might be helping.Shares have been on a tear since the company reported first-quarter earnings, leading to a stretched valuation for even a hot growth stock.Tesla shares added 1.1% to $345.86 in early trading, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%.Musk said at a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, according to Bloomberg. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The statement isn't a big surprise for investors, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He has some work to do at Tesla. Tuesday's stock gains come despite Tesla selling 11,150 cars in China this past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung. That is a big improvement from the 3,040 sold the week before, but results are still down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Investors have been looking for a recovery in Tesla's sales after the number of vehicles delivered dipped 13% in the first quarter from a year ago. It hasn't gotten there yet. In the first seven weeks of the second quarter, Tesla sold about 48,000 vehicles in China, down 24% from the comparable time a year ago.Despite the weak sales, coming into Tuesday trading, Tesla stock was up about 44% since the company reported its first-quarter earnings on April 22. That left shares trading for about 172 times estimated 2025 earnings, up from closer to 72 times a year ago.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas sees the valuation getting even higher before it gets better, although that doesn't mean he believes the stock is going down.The valuation-multiple expansion is hard for value-oriented investors to understand. A year ago, Tesla shares were roughly $200 and Wall Street projected 2025 earnings roughly $3. Now, shares are north of $340, and Wall Street's 2025 EPS estimate is below $2.The stock has risen while estimates have fallen. ""Nearly 15 years after going public, investors struggle to justify the value of Tesla as much as ever before,"" wrote Jonas on Monday, adding he sees the valuation problem getting ""worse before it gets better.""The problem is the future. Tesla is investing heavily in AI and robotics, and those businesses don't generate substantial earnings yet. ""The majority of the company's current $1.1 trillion market [value] is based on businesses that have either poor disclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all,"" added Jonas.He rates Tesla shares Buy and has a $410 price target for the stock, valuing the company at roughly $1.3 trillion. Only $240 billion, or $75 a share, of the valuation comes from the car business.The majority of his value comes from AI-related businesses such as self-driving cars. He doesn't have the robot business in his model, which could easily be worth $100 a share, by his math. Including that number for robots, Tesla's nonautomotive businesses are worth some $1.4 trillion, despite low or no earnings at this point.Jonas' views essentially sums up the difference between Tesla bulls and bears these days. The bulls are full of AI optimism. The bears are confused.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Uber Stock Is Dropping. Blame Elon Musk and Tesla. — Barrons.com,1747861560000,"Al RootUber Technologies stock fell Wednesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he didn't need to buy the ride-hailing company. Wait. Was that on the table?Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday afternoon in Austin, Texas, where Tesla plans to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in June. Faber asked why Tesla doesn't buy Uber to give its business an immediate boost.""There's no need,"" answered Musk.Uber has created a digital platform to manage demand for rides and the supply of drivers. Musk says Tesla can develop an app of its own. What is more, ""we have millions of cars that will be able to operate autonomously,"" he said.Musk is referring to Tesla vehicles owned by regular car drivers, which will be able to operate autonomously when Tesla's full self-driving software gets good enough. He envisions Tesla owners renting out their vehicles to Tesla to make money when they aren't using them. It would be like Airbnb, but for cars.Uber stock lost 3.5%, closing at $88.67, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The effects of autonomous-driving technology have been debated for months. Fear about self-driving cars, and how they might affect companies such as Uber, likely reached its peak a year ago, around the time Musk announced that Tesla would host a robo-taxi event in August. The event was eventually held in October.From the end of 2023 into the summer of 2024, Uber stock declined about 5%.Still, Uber has its own self-driving strategy, announcing deals with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to Uber's networks in Austin and Atlanta. That helped calm investors' nerves. Coming into Wednesday trading, Uber stock was up about 55% from its summer 2024 lows.Investors are still waiting to see how the self-driving ride-hailing market works, but it doesn't have to be a winner-take-all market. For starters, fleets of cars are expensive. Musk believes one of Tesla's key advantages is all the car buyers who have already paid for Teslas. Having a partner like Uber could lower capital costs for Waymo, or even for Tesla.There is also something to be said for the Uber brand. ""Uber"" has essentially become the verb for using a ride-hailing service.Musk's comments might have surprised investors, a little, eliminating any small price premium reflecting the long odds of a buyout.The challenge now is to understand and assess the development of the robo-taxi market in the coming years, and then to pick winners and losers.Uber is valued at $190 billion, more than General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis combined. Tesla is valued north of $1 trillion.Exactly how much is related to robo-taxis is hard to say. Most bullish Tesla analysts say a majority of the value is due to Tesla's AI expertise, which teaches cars to drive themselves.Alphabet, which controls Waymo, is valued at $2 trillion. How much Waymo of that represents is hard to say. Most of Alphabet's money still comes from Google's search business. Still, Waymo's progress has been substantial. It completes more than 250,000 driverless rides a week and announced Tuesday it had passed 10 million fully autonomous paid rides.It is safe to say there are hundreds of billions, even trillions, of value at stake in driverless cars. That is a large enough market to keep investors optimistic about Uber.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Wolfspeed was aiming to work out a Chapter 11 plan that has support of a majority of its creditors.Tesla fell 2.7%. CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday indicated he was committed to the electric-vehicle company. The chief executive told a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, and also said he would step back from political spending. Musk also told CNBC in an interview that Tesla was on track for a June launch of robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, adding the rollout would be slow.Nvidia was down 1.9%. CEO Jensen Huang again slammed U.S. curbs on the chip maker's exports to China.

Tesla Stock Drops. Its Self-Driving Cars May Not Be Self Driving After All. — Barrons.com,1747858560000,"Al RootTesla stock rose early Wednesday but couldn't hold gains, and shares sold off with the market. Still, it's been a strong May for shares. Comments Elon Musk made on Tuesday show just how important June will be for the shares.One surprise from Musk, however, is that Tesla's first self-driving taxis might not be as self-driving as investors expect.Tesla stock traded as high as $347.25 but closed at $334.62, down 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Last week, Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber in Austin, Texas. Musk confirmed that Tesla plans to start robo-taxi service in the city by the end of June. He also indicated that there would be a small number of cars initially, humans would supervise operations, and the self-driving Teslas would only be able to go where the company was confident they could succeed.Having humans oversee and potentially intervene as tele0perators might not be exactly what investors expected for a robotaxi service, though. Musk has his reasons. ""We're going to be extremely paranoid about deployment, as we should.""""It's prudent for us to start with a small number,"" he added. That could be as low as 10. The goal is to be at a thousand in a few months and ""hundreds of thousands"" by the end of 2026. Any Tesla that has the correct hardware can become a robo-taxi when the AI-trained self-driving software gets good enough. At that point, Tesla owners can elect to use their vehicles to make money in the robo-taxi network when they aren't using their vehicles.That's the goal, anyway. Musk also reiterated his expectation that Tesla could license its technology to other auto makers. Seeing Teslas drive themselves in Austin successfully could be a catalyst for a deal.Musk also addressed self-driving technology competition with BYD. He's confident Tesla has a superior product, citing local independent testing.Earlier on Tuesday, via video at a conference in Qatar, Musk also said that he expects to be CEO in five years — and he had a lot to say. Musk said he would spend less time in Washington, D.C., in April, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He added that he expects to reduce his political spending. The reduction can have a significant impact on 2025 midterm races,"" says Carl Tobias, Williams Chair at the University of Richmond Law School. He hopes Musk's D.C. departure will reduce or end some of the ""destructive activity"" undertaken by DOGE. Investors hope less politics can help heal any brand damage from Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration.Musk stepping back from politics and speaking positively about this company and Tesla's AI technology are to be expected.

Update: CATL Goes Public in Hong Kong. The Tesla Battery Supplier Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs. — Barrons.com,1747749120000,"Al RootShares of electric-vehicle-battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at HKD$263 apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750."" The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It's stepping on the gas while Honda is hitting the break.Tuesday, Honda announced plans to ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend 10 trillion Yen, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by 3 trillion Yen, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda's U.S.-listed American Depository Receipts were up 0.8% in early trading, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach while also pleased the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It's also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla's Robotaxi Revolution: Is it Too Late to Buy the Stock?,1747842900000,"Robotaxi is a word that once was the exclusive to the world of science fiction. As it turns out, Demolition Man is about to manifest itself in reality. Elon Musk revealed that Tesla ( TSLA ) is going to begin deploying self-driving taxi cabs to the streets of the US. It’s only a matter of time before transportation as a whole is drastically changed forever. The democratization of getting from point A to point B. Henry Ford is blushing somewhere.Of course, I understand that Elon isn’t everybody’s favorite anymore. Political motivations have created diverging feelings amongst us. For those that know me, at this point you realize that I couldn’t care less about politics. In my opinion, it’s theatre, sensationalized to evoke your emotions and get you to click and share articles. Here, I want to look at the inner workings of Tesla’s chart and try to figure out where the next moves might run into trouble.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Tesla’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70b91188a094b:0-tesla-s-robotaxi-revolution-is-it-too-late-to-buy-the-stock/

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

General Motors Ceases Vehicle Exports to China From the United States,1747829160000,"General Motors Company GM last week informed its employees and dealers involved in its China export operations that it will no longer ship vehicles from the United States to China. This decision comes amid ongoing trade and tariff negotiations between the United States and China.GM had been exporting vehicles to China through its premium import brand, The Durant Guild, which accounted for less than 0.1% of its total sales in the country, per a company spokesperson. Due to major shifts in economic conditions, GM has decided to restructure the Durant Guild and streamline its operations in China. Previously, U.S.-made goods imported into China were subject to tariffs exceeding 100%, though these were temporarily reduced as part of a 90-day agreement between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2025, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 442,000 vehicles in China, marking year-over-year sales growth and the third straight quarter of increasing market share. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, jumped 53.2% compared to the same period last year. GM, which already offers the most extensive NEV lineup among global automakers in China, plans to expand its portfolio further in 2025 by introducing extended-range electric vehicles, ensuring at least one NEV option for every new locally launched model. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .In April, GM’s rival, Ford Motor Company F, paused shipments of several U.S.-built vehicles, including the F-150 Raptor, Mustang, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator, to China due to retaliatory tariffs that pushed import taxes as high as 150%. Ford is considered one of the automakers most capable of handling tariffs, as roughly 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built domestically. However, Ford may still increase prices on new vehicles if tariff woes deepen.Last month, Tesla, Inc. TSLA also halted new orders for its Model S and Model X on its Chinese website after China increased tariffs on U.S. imports. New orders for both Tesla models were also no longer accessible through the automaker's WeChat mini program in China. Rising competition from BYD and other domestic manufacturers has also hurt Tesla's sales in China.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:10ffb6a71094b:0-general-motors-ceases-vehicle-exports-to-china-from-the-united-states/
Musk Says Tesla Situation 'Has Already Turned Around:' Bloomberg,1747747656000,,https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250520:A3381979:0/
China's BYD turns up heat in Europe with launch of Dolphin Surf EV,1747827863000,"Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD's SZSE:002594 low-cost Dolphin Surf became its 10th model available in Europe on Wednesday, with the Berlin launch increasing pressure on European rivals to produce more affordable alternatives.The car will sell at three price points, from 22,990 euros ($26,100) for a 322-kilometre (200-mile) range, to 24,990 euros for a 507-kilometre range.Until the end of June, the three versions will be available at a discounted price of 19,990-24,990 euros, sales chief Patrick Schulz said on Wednesday.The car piles pressure on European automakers to offer more affordable electric alternatives, with cost still a major barrier to wider adoption of EVs.Only a handful of models, such as the Dacia Spring or Leapmotor's T03, are on sale in Europe for under 20,000 euros, although 11 new models priced under 25,000 euros will go on sale this year, including Volkswagen's XETR:VOW ID.2, the Renault R5, the Fiat Grand Panda, and the Hyundai Inster.""The compact segment is the next frontier for electrification in Europe,"" Maria Grazia Davino, BYD regional managing director for markets including Germany, said in Berlin. ""We think this market has huge potential.""The Chinese version of the vehicle, the Seagull, has fuelled BYD's exponential rise in China, second only to Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA Model Y in total sales in 2024 with over 442,000 registrations.Globally, sales of the model have risen 45% this year so far to 170,000, BYD said on Wednesday.BYD, which last year surpassed Tesla to become the world's largest EV manufacturer, is overhauling its European operations, widening its dealer network, offering more hybrids and hiring managers with local experience, after early stumbles in the region stymied sales.Sales data indicates the revamp is working. In Germany, sales reached 2,791 in the first four months of the year, data from Germany's motor authority KBA showed, fast approaching the 2,891 vehicles it sold all year in 2024.That success is mirrored across Europe, where sales quadrupled in the first quarter to 37,201 cars, in sharp contrast to Tesla's sales, which plunged 37.2%.BYD will enter 12 new markets in Europe this year, Davino said, with sales locations to expand to over 1,000.($1 = 0.8808 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RT0SI:0-china-s-byd-turns-up-heat-in-europe-with-launch-of-dolphin-surf-ev/"

Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help.

CATL Goes Public in Hong Kong. The Tesla Battery Supplier Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs. — Barrons.com,1747746060000,"Al RootShares of electric-vehicle-battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Thursday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at HKD$263 apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750."" The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It's stepping on the gas while Honda is hitting the break.Tuesday, Honda announced plans to ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend 10 trillion Yen, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by 3 trillion Yen, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda stock was up 0.8% in overseas trading, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were flat.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another.

"TSLA: Tesla Stock Gains as Elon Musk Vows to Bet Less on Politics, Focus on Business",1747816255000,"Billionaire CEO spoke at a Qatar conference, saying he planned to still be the Tesla boss five years from now. Shares were the only bright spot in the Big Tech realm. 🚗 Breaking Away from Mag 7 Slump- Tesla stock NASDAQ:TSLA bucked the broader Big Tech, Mag 7 slump on Tuesday, as CEO Elon Musk told a global audience he’s stepping back from political spending to refocus on the business. Speaking via video at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk said he plans to reduce his involvement in US politics — at least for now, at least financially. - “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said. “I think I’ve done enough.” - Estimates show that the billionaire-turned-unelected-politician spent as much as $300 million backing President Trump’s 2024 campaign, emerging as one of the biggest individual political contributors of the cycle. But right now, Musk says he sees “no reason” to continue funding political efforts unless something changes. 📣 Musk Seeks More Control of Tesla- In addition to dialing down his political bets, Musk made it clear he’s sticking with Tesla — and doesn’t plan on leaving anytime soon. Asked if he’d still be Tesla CEO in five years, he answered simply, “Yes,” before adding, “Well, I might die.” - In characteristic fashion, Musk added a dose of nuance to his long-term commitment: he wants voting control to avoid being kicked out by activist shareholders. Later on Tuesday in a CNBC interview, Musk said he’s aiming to increase his stake in Tesla to 25%, up from the 12.77% he currently holds — a position worth over $140 billion. - “That’s the number I’d feel comfortable at, because that’s where I have some control, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out,” Musk explained. “If I’m destroying the value of the company or if I’ve just gone flat-out crazy,” he added, “they could still remove me.” 🤫 Wall Street’s Nod of Approval- Shares of the EV maker rose during a session that saw most of the tech sector in the red. Investors appeared to appreciate Musk’s recommitment to Tesla’s future and his hint at stepping away from politics — a topic that’s drawn controversy and criticism from some shareholders and the broader public. - Less drama and more deliveries? Sounds like a plan, maybe. Especially when looking ahead to the planned robotaxi launch.

Wall Street Loves China's Battery Beast--Even the Pentagon Can't Stop It,1747743395000,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd (CATL) just pulled off the biggest listing of the yearand did it with style. The Chinese battery leader's shares jumped 16% in their Hong Kong debut after raising $4.6 billion, a number that could climb to $5.3 billion with full allotment. The offering attracted massive interest from both institutional and retail investors, despite CATL being blacklisted by the Pentagon earlier this yeara move the company continues to deny relevance to. The stock opened at HK$263 and closed well above that, even trading higher than its Shenzhen counterparta rare feat for dual-listed Chinese names.CATL, the dominant force behind 38% of the global EV battery market, supplies Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , Volkswagen, Ford, and others. It's also stepping on the gas with new tech: batteries that can deliver over 500km of range in just five minutes of charging and up to 1,500km fully charged. That kind of leap, combined with a forward earnings multiple around 17x, has some analysts seeing upside potential of up to 50%. Jefferies' Johnson Wan noted the setup was a no-brainer buy, citing solid fundamentals, global tailwinds, and a fresh $7.6 billion earmarked for overseas expansionespecially into Europe, where margins are wider and demand is climbing.Options trading volume on day one topped 34,000 contracts, the highest in a decade for Hong Kong IPOs with listed options, and sentiment leaned heavily bullish. Backed by big names like Qatar Investment Authority and Hillhouse, CATL's listing could help revive Hong Kong's IPO scene, lifting total issuance above $22 billion for the year. JPMorgan and Bank of America, despite political pushback from a U.S. congressional committee, stayed on the dealsignaling confidence in CATL's growth story. Chairman Robin Zeng called the listing a milestone in its push for a zero-carbon future, while the broader market seems to agree: investors want in, and they're willing to look past the noise to bet on the next leg of the global EV race.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:36a2c0669094b:0-wall-street-loves-china-s-battery-beast-even-the-pentagon-can-t-stop-it/

General Motors Urges Lawmakers to Block EV Mandate as EV Demand Slows,1747743240000,"General Motors Company GM is urging lawmakers to block California’s strict zero-emission vehicle mandate, signaling a significant reversal in the automaker’s stance as demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States begins to slow, per the Wall Street Journal.Per an internal email sent by GM to thousands of salaried employees last week, emissions regulations that are not aligned with market conditions threaten the company’s business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable.Once a supporter of California’s plan to phase out gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035, GM is now lobbying against it. The company is encouraging employees to contact Senators to revoke California’s waiver, which permits the state to enforce stricter emissions rules. These rules have been adopted by 11 other states. GM had previously aligned its EV strategy with California's goals, but declining EV demand and market pressures have prompted a strategic shift. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .California aims for 35% of all new vehicle sales to be electric or plug-in hybrid (PHEV) by 2026. However, in the first quarter, EVs accounted for 20.8% of sales and PHEVs 3.7%, totaling 24.5%, which is roughly 10 percentage points below the target and slightly down from the previous quarter.As EV sales fall short of projections, major automakers like GM and Ford Motor Company F are scaling back their EV initiatives. GM has abandoned its plan to produce 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and postponed several key launches as consumers prefer more affordable options and federal tax incentives face potential rollbacks.In the first four months of 2025, Ford’s EV sales declined 2.9% year over year to 27,409 units. Also, the company's Model e segment, which features all-electric models, continues to struggle amid stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024, exacerbated by ongoing pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. The company is expected to incur huge losses in its EV business this year as well. Another auto giant, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, is also struggling with falling demand for EVs. In the first quarter, Tesla deliveries fell 13% year over year to 336,681 units. Automotive margins are also on the decline amid falling volumes and generous discount offers. The metric came in at 11.3% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 15.5% reported in the corresponding quarter of 2024. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c8c334c74094b:0-general-motors-urges-lawmakers-to-block-ev-mandate-as-ev-demand-slows/

"High-Yield ETFs: Big Payouts, Bigger Trade-Offs?",1747743240000,"While a significant amount of money continues to flow into low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs, the ETF universe is becoming increasingly complex. Most new ETFs being launched are actively managed, and many make use of derivatives.Two recent regulatory changes—the “ETF Rule” and the “Derivatives Rule”—have made it easier for providers to launch ETFs and incorporate derivatives into their strategies. The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking.Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:Buffer or defined outcome ETFsLeveraged or inverse single-stock ETFsOption-based income ETFsSome of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs. (See: Buffer ETFs Attract Billions as Investors Seek Shelter from Market Turmoil)This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts.We analyzed the performance of 24 single-stock covered call ETFs in the YieldMax suite from their respective inception dates. We focused on YieldMax because it is the clear leader in this niche, significantly ahead of competitors despite a recent surge in similar offerings.Many of YieldMax’s ETFs launched in 2023—providing a limited, yet more substantial, performance history compared to most rivals, which are even newer.Despite their eye-popping distribution rates, these products tend to underperform on a total return basis due to steep declines in share price. Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, only two managed to slightly outperform their respective underlying stocks.Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy WorksYieldMax currently offers 48 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of over $10 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market.According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap.These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income.To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spread strategies to further enhance yields.The YieldMax Reddit community has around 44,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income.The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums—and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM.Yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly payout and dividing it by the fund’s latest NAV. However, yields can vary significantly from month to month as income from selling options depends on fluctuations in the underlying stock, implied volatility, and other factors.Performance Since InceptionWe analyzed the total return—including distributions—of 24 YieldMax single-stock ETFs from their inception versus their respective underlying stocks. Some stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat—but in all cases except those tracking PayPal PYPL and Marathon Digital MARA, the ETF underperformed the stock.For the four most popular products, the performance gap was substantial—showing that investors may be leaving a lot of money on the table in pursuit of yield.YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY )The most popular product in the suite celebrated its one-year anniversary in February and now boasts $4 billion in assets. It is also the highest-yielding single-stock ETF in the lineup, offering a distribution rate of 136%. Since inception, it has delivered a total return of 286%, while MSTR stock has surged 457% during the same period.Once a little-known, money-losing software firm, Strategy MSTR has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and now trades like a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. Its stock commands a significant premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings.Some experts believe the financial engineering behind MSTY—and the premium valuation—may be unsustainable. If you're bullish on bitcoin, why not consider the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which charges just 0.25% and closely tracks the price of the asset?TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY)The oldest product in the suite holds $1.2 billion in assets. Since its debut in November 2022, the ETF has gained approximately 22%—significantly underperforming Tesla TSLA shares, which are up about 102% over the same period. It has also lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, which have gained 53% and 85%, respectively.For context, low-cost index funds like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM charge just 0.02% and 0.15% in fees, while most option income products charge close to 1%. TSLY currently boasts a striking yield of nearly 107%.NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY )The second most popular product in the family has generated a total return of about 187% since its inception in May 2023. However, shares of the AI darling NVIDIA NVDA have risen approximately 372% over the same period. Still, the ETF has attracted $1.3 billion in assets.YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY )CONY, which tracks Coinbase COIN—a major beneficiary of bitcoin’s rise—has returned 120% since its debut in August 2023. Over the same period, COIN stock has gained about 209%. The ETF currently sports a yield of 97% and has about $1.1 billion in assets.Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFsThese ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price. In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if the stock falls—creating an asymmetric risk-reward profile.By contrast, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI—which helped launch the covered call trend—uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of about 125 stocks. (Read: What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?)The fund then sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate monthly income. This portfolio doesn’t experience the outsized moves seen in names like Strategy or Coinbase, which explains why the performance shortfall may not be too striking.Bottom LineYou should only invest in a fund tied to a single stock if you're bullish on that specific name—in which case, you're generally better off owning the stock directly. If you expect the stock to decline, it’s best to steer clear of any product linked to it.These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound. However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don’t expect jumbo distributions.If you’re drawn to high monthly income and can accept an asymmetric risk-reward profile—as well as potentially unfavorable and inconsistent tax treatment—these funds may still appeal to you.ETFs have democratized access to markets, and innovation in the space has been remarkable. But with complex products like these, it’s essential for investors to fully understand how they work—and what outcomes are realistic.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ab88debad094b:0-high-yield-etfs-big-payouts-bigger-trade-offs/

Tesla (TSLA) Faces Scrutiny as Morgan Stanley Flags Valuation Gaps,1747777368000,"Tesla (TSLA, Financials) continues to draw scrutiny from Wall Street as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said the company's valuation is increasingly difficult to justify, even after 15 years on the public market.Tesla trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 181.98x, well above most growth stocks. The stock is up more than 95% over the past 12 months but has declined 15% so far in 2025. According to TipRanks data cited in the report, much of Tesla's valuation rests on opaque or pre-commercialized business segments.Jonas maintains a Buy rating with a $410 price target, suggesting nearly 20% upside. But he said most investors continue to evaluate Tesla solely based on its electric vehicle unitassigning just $50$100 per share to that segmentwhile overlooking other high-potential verticals.Morgan Stanley's sum-of-the-parts model gives significant weight to Tesla's energy storage, robotaxi, and humanoid robot businesses. Jonas estimates the energy storage segment alone is worth $67 per share, excluding future recurring revenues.The autonomous Cybercab service is expected to launch in Austin next month with 10 to 20 vehicles. Additionally, Jonas projected that Tesla's Optimus robot, if it replaces just 1% of global human labor, could add over $300 billion in valueor about $100 per share.Jonas argued that investors' narrow focus is equivalent to valuing Amazon (AMZN, Financials) solely as a retailer or Apple (AAPL, Financials) only as a device company, missing the broader innovation ecosystem.Investors should monitor Tesla's upcoming robotaxi rollout and a potential Optimus event later in 2025 as catalysts that could reshape the company's valuation narrative.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:77874274c094b:0-tesla-tsla-faces-scrutiny-as-morgan-stanley-flags-valuation-gaps/

Tesla Sets Record With $139 Million Pay Package for Finance Chief — WSJ,1747733400000,"By Theo FrancisElon Musk isn't the only Tesla executive rewriting the compensation playbook. The electric carmaker's finance chief, Vaibhav Taneja, received a pay package of $139 million last year.That's more than most CEOs and the highest amount paid to a chief financial officer since modern reporting began in 2006, according to Equilar. It eclipses the $86 million package that hydrogen-truck maker Nikola gave its then-CFO in 2020. Nikola filed for bankruptcy this year.Taneja's compensation was tied to stock options and equity awards he received in October 2024 that recognized his promotion to CFO in August 2023. The 47-year-old has held other financial roles at Tesla since 2017.Taneja's boss, meanwhile, is still working without a paycheck. Tesla's board has formed a special committee to review Musk's compensation. His pay has been tied up in legal fights since a multibillion stock grant was thrown out by a court. Tesla has appealed that decision.Tesla's shares were trading near $250 at the time of Taneja's equity award, which vests — or becomes fully Taneja's property to sell or exercise — over four years. They closed around $342 on Monday.The award came during a period of mixed results for Tesla. While the stock soared toward the end of the year following the election of President Trump, global vehicle deliveries fell for the first time in more than a decade. In the first quarter, deliveries fell 13% and net profit fell 71%.Tesla and Taneja didn't respond to requests for comment. In an April 30 regulatory filing discussing the award, Tesla said it reviewed its compensation to reflect individual performance and retention in light of current equity awards.Write to Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250520002575:0/

Alphabet's Waymo gets California nod for robotaxi expansion in San Francisco Bay Area,1747701998000,"Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG self-driving unit Waymo said on Monday it received approval from California to expand its robotaxi operations in more areas of the San Francisco Peninsula and further south, including San Jose.Waymo's permission from California comes as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA gears up to roll out a paid robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, next month. CEO Elon Musk has said the electric vehicle maker will expand the service to California later this year.Waymo requested authorization to expand its operations in March and received 23 responses in support and no protests from stakeholders, California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement.Waymo, however, said it would not expand the services in the San Francisco Bay Area immediately.""We want to bring Waymo One to more of the Bay Area, and any expansion of the service will happen methodically over time,"" a company spokesperson said. The spokesperson did not provide any reason for that decision and said there were ""no imminent plans or timeline to share.""Waymo is the only U.S. firm to run uncrewed robotaxi services carrying paying passengers. The company has more than 1,500 vehicles on the road across San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin, Texas, and runs over 250,000 rides a week.Self-driving vehicle companies have been under increased regulatory scrutiny following a major accident in 2023 in San Francisco involving a robotaxi from General Motors' NYSE:GM Cruise, which later shut operations.Waymo, which has been growing its presence steadily, is recalling more than 1,200 self-driving vehicles to update software and address risks of collisions with chains, gates and other roadway barriers, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last week. U.S. auto safety investigators had opened a probe last year.NHTSA has been investigating Tesla's full self-driving collisions in reduced roadway visibility conditions since October and asked the company last week to answer questions on its robotaxi launch plans to assess how the vehicles would perform in poor weather.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RS00B:0-alphabet-s-waymo-gets-california-nod-for-robotaxi-expansion-in-san-francisco-bay-area/"
Elon Musk to Cut Back Political Spending — WSJ,1747774320000,"By Eliot Brown, Tali Arbel and Joseph PisaniElon Musk says he plans to cut back on political spending, after making huge donations in the 2024 election to boost President Trump.""In terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" he said in a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. ""I think I've done enough.""Musk, the world's richest person, who according to filings spent close to $300 million in 2024 to help Trump and other Republicans, indicated he still could increase spending again if conditions change.""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it, "" he said. ""I do not currently see a reason.""Musk played a polarizing role in the early weeks of the Trump administration, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency as it slashed federal spending and jobs.In April, Musk said he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla, his electric-vehicle company. Investors had grown worried that he had taken his eye off the ball, with Tesla's sales and share price dropping during his time in the White House.On Tuesday, asked if he would still be chief executive of Tesla in five years, Musk said, ""Yes."" He then added a caveat, saying, ""Well, I might die.""The Wall Street Journal recently reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tesla board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla's next CEO. The board members, concerned that Musk was spending too much time in Washington, told him he needed to spend more time on Tesla.Tesla later issued a denial and Musk criticized the article on X, his social-media platform.Musk said during the Qatar forum that he wanted enough voting control in Tesla that he can't be ousted by activist investors. He clarified in a CNBC interview later Tuesday that he would want to up his stake in the company to 25%.""That's the number I'd feel comfortable at, because that's where I have some control, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out,"" Musk said, adding that he could still be removed ""if I'm destroying the value of the company or if I've just gone flat-out crazy.""Musk currently owns a 12.77% stake in Tesla, worth more than $140 billion, according to FactSet.Musk shrugged off declining Tesla sales — deliveries fell 13% in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier — saying that while the company had lost some liberal customers over his prominent role in the Trump administration, it had gained others among his political supporters.""Our sales are doing well at this point,"" he said. ""It's already turned around.""Last month when Tesla reported first-quarter earnings, the electric-vehicle maker's net income fell by 71%, in part, on weaker demand .In the CNBC interview, Musk said Tesla was ""seeing a major rebound in demand"" and brushed off concerns about consumer reaction to his political activities. ""When you buy a product, I mean how much do you care about the political views of the CEO?""Musk also said that he expected a handful of autonomous robotaxis would be on roads in Austin, Texas, by the end of June. From there, Tesla will expand to other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. He predicted by year's end there will be hundreds of thousands of self-driving Teslas in the U.S., though not specifically robotaxis.After initially planning to stay out of the 2024 election, Musk became one of the largest individual donors in U.S. election history. Musk then turned his sights to the state level, pouring more than $23 million into a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race in April to boost a Republican-backed candidate. But the effort resulted in a loss — the liberal candidate won.Musk dismissed potential conflicts of interest in his role as a top adviser to Trump and his extensive business interests, which include SpaceX, a leading commercial space-exploration company and government contractor, and xAI, an artificial-intelligence startup.""I have not seen any case where there has been an accusation of conflict, "" he said, adding that his work is only advisory — leaving it up to others in the administration to choose whether to enact his suggested cuts.When asked on Tuesday about the Journal's reporting last year that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin since late 2022, Musk said he spoke to the Russian president once.

Cantor Sees Tesla Ahead of Lucid,1747774235000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA overtakes Lucid in Cantor's EV showdown, driven by scale advantages and a pipeline of near-term catalysts. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard favors Tesla over Lucid NASDAQ:LCID as the better U.S. EV play, citing Tesla's $1.1 trillion market capover four times Toyota'sversus Lucid's much smaller footprint.Tesla's first quarter underscored both headwinds and strengths: automotive revenue slid 9.2 % year-over-year to $14 billion, dragging total top-line to $19.34 billion and missing consensus by over $2 billion, while energy generation and storage revenues jumped 67 % to $2.73 billion. EPS came in at $0.27, $0.15 below forecasts, yet shares have rallied about 47 % since the April 22 report on easing tariff tensions and Musk's pledge to refocus on Tesla. Lucid, by contrast, remains unprofitable and far smaller in deliveries and scale.Sheppard's bullish case rests on a slate of catalysts: next month's Robotaxi launch in Texas; a lower-priced $30,000 model debut in H1 25; ongoing Full Self-Driving rollouts in China and planned European launches; Optimus humanoid robot production in 2026 with customer deliveries by 2027; and the long-awaited Semi Truck entering production in 2026.

US expected to declare Biden fuel economy rules exceeded legal authority,1747698772000,"The U.S. Transportation Department is expected to declare that fuel economy rules issued under then President Joe Biden exceeded the government's legal authority by including electric vehicles in setting the rules, automaker officials said Monday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday submitted its interpretive rule, ""Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program"" to the White House for review.The prior administration had ""illegally used CAFE standards as a backdoor electric vehicle mandate – driving the price of cars up,"" he said in a statement.Removing EVs from the calculations for credits and the regulatory mandates could result in lower overall fuel economy requirements.NHTSA in June said it would hike CAFE requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 liters per 100 km) by 2031 from 39.1 mpg currently for light-duty vehicles.Last year, 120 Republican lawmakers said NHTSA exceeded its authority by adopting fuel economy standards ""that effectively mandate EVs while at the same time force the internal combustion engine out of the market.""The lawmakers said the agency ""accounted for EVs in its regulatory baseline and factored that baseline into its determination of the maximum achievable CAFE standards.""House Republicans last week proposed killing the EV tax credit and repealing fuel efficiency rules designed to prod automakers into building more zero-emission vehicles as part of a broad-based tax reform bill.Federal law requires NHTSA to set CAFE standards at the maximum feasible level.The Environmental Protection Agency said it was beginning the effort to reverse the Biden administration's parallel vehicle emissions rules that would force automakers to build a rising number of EVs but has not begun any effort to rescind California's legal authority for its 2035 EV rules. EPA is also reconsidering rules awarding credits for ""start-stop"" technology, which is in around half of new vehicles.NHTSA said last year the rule would reduce gasoline consumption by 64 billion gallons and cut emissions by 659 million metric tons.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RR143:0-us-expected-to-declare-biden-fuel-economy-rules-exceeded-legal-authority/"
"Musk says he'll resume working '24/7' at his companies, X outage mostly restored",1748103474000,"Elon Musk's social media platform X was largely restored for most users after an outage that impacted tens of thousands of users in the United States on Saturday, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com, following which he said that he is ""back to spending 24/7"" at his companies.At its peak around 8:51 a.m. ET (1251 GMT), there were more than 25,800 incidents of people reporting issues with the social media platform, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources including users. The number of outages has since gone below 650, as of 12:09 p.m. ET.""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.

Thousands of users in other countries, such as Germany, Spain, France, India, Canada, Australia, and Britain, also experienced issues with accessing the social media platform at the height of the outage, according to Downdetector data.X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the outage.Musk, who spent nearly $300 million to back U.S. President Donald Trump's presidential campaign and other Republicans last year, said on Tuesday he will cut his political spending substantially, signalling that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.He led the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs and cancel billions of dollars in contracts and grants.However, his political views triggered waves of protests against Tesla in the U.S. and Europe, leading to a slump in sales, with the automaker reporting its first drop in annual deliveries last year.The amount of time Musk has spent at Tesla has concerned some investors. Looking to ease those worries, Musk told investors last month he would reduce his time with DOGE to a day or two a week from May.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L2N3RW01X:0-musk-says-he-ll-resume-working-24-7-at-his-companies-x-outage-mostly-restored/"
Correction to EV Battery Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs — Barrons.com,1747773720000,"Al RootShares of battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at 263 Hong Kong dollars apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750.""The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It is stepping on the power while Honda is hitting the brakes.Tuesday, Honda said it would ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend Yen10 trillion, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by Yen3 trillion, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda's U.S.-listed American depositary receipts rose 1.2% to $29.62, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach, but also welcome the idea that the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It is also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tim Higgins: Angry Elon Is Back. That's Good for Tesla. — WSJ,1748079000000,"By Tim HigginsListening to Elon Musk these days is to hear a man who feels unfairly treated.And, as he skulks away from the White House with his tail between his legs, he is particularly thin skinned. Angry that he was cast as a Nazi. Angry that some used his politics as an excuse to attack Tesla. Angry that he's being scrutinized.We've seen this before. Musk has always had an incredibly large chip on his shoulder — one fueled by perceived slights and personal grievances, critics expressing disbelief and the chorus of social-media doubters.But history has shown that it can unleash something fierce: Angry Elon. Like the Incredible Hulk busting out of his britches and turning green, Musk goes silent before exploding. These days, Musk again seems to be fuming, his eyes darting upward, his vision clouded red with anger.And Angry Elon could be a very good thing for Tesla investors. It can focus him on executing, on proving everyone wrong. A Musk that executes can go to outer space, can make electric cars mainstream.But investors haven't seen Musk execute in a while.Instead, they've seen promises of a cheap Tesla that would fuel 20 million annual vehicle sales seemingly abandoned. They've seen the Cybertruck flop. They've seen profitability shrink and sales fall for the first time in more than a decade.Worrisome stuff to investors concerned Musk has been too distracted in Washington. Even board members appeared unnerved.But fans remembering the power of Angry Elon drew hope from signs this past week that he might be back. First, via video link to a conference in Qatar, Musk on Tuesday delivered salty answer after salty answer to concerns about the state of his companies.Asked when he might be able to turn things around at Tesla, the chief executive replied, ""It's already turned around.""Musk's proof point? Essentially, the age-old retort by Tesla fans on social media: The stock price, bro!Since announcing on April 22 that he would pare back his time in the Trump administration, Tesla shares have risen 43%. This returned the automaker to the rarefied status of being valued at slightly more than $1 trillion. Overall, those shares are still down both 11% year-to-date and 29% from an all-time high.Analysts estimate Tesla unit sales will finish the year down from 2024. This is a reversal from just a few months ago when they expected year-over-year gains.Musk's vision for the future of Tesla isn't bothered by the boring part of selling electric vehicles. Instead, his future is all about ushering in a new era of robotics — driverless cars and humanoid robots.For roughly a decade, he has said the day was near for Tesla's autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon.com's Zoox have put fully autonomous cars on public roads.On Tuesday, Musk doubled down in a second public appearance, this time on CNBC, reaffirming that Tesla is on track to begin offering driverless cars in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.The plan, he said, is to begin with probably 10 vehicles on the road in the first week, then increase that figure by tens of vehicles each week and probably reach 1,000 within a few months. He added that there would probably be hundreds of thousands of autonomous Tesla vehicles by the end of next year, if not more than one million.It's the kind of ultra-ambitious targets he has promoted before. He just needs to execute.During the CNBC interview, his recent track record in Washington was questioned and he snapped again: ""Why are you attacking this, given that we've made so much progress?""Even as he defended his DOGE efforts, Musk has begun amplifying the idea that he is stepping back from politics after realizing the Republican-controlled Congress lacks the appetite to implement spending reductions. ""I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential,"" he posted Friday. "" @DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.""And robots are his solution.Seeing glimpses of Angry Elon excites supporters the same way Optimistic Elon did almost a year ago at the Tesla annual meeting. His enthusiasm — dancing around on stage — seemed to signal he was dialed in after more than a year of distractions from buying Twitter.After shareholders re-approved his massive pay package, Musk stood on stage painting a bright Tesla future filled with humanoid robots and driverless cars. He suggested that could drive the company's valuation to more than $30 trillion.Now, supporters are hoping Angry Elon is ready to finally deliver.""War time Elon is activated,"" a popular X account called Autism Capital posted in response to Musk's Qatar appearance. Others crowed something similar. ""Elon is in WAR TIME CEO mode,"" a MAGA social-media account posted Wednesday. ""He is done playing around. Total laser focus on execution.""Tesla was founded on a rather unlikely idea of making EVs cool and mainstream. For much of its existence, Tesla has faced criticism that it couldn't succeed. And Musk was out there selling investors and customers on the idea that the vision was, in fact, possible.He just needed to execute. And once he did, it was a real game-changer. Tesla hit its stride in late 2019 and 2020, becoming consistently profitable and cementing Musk's image as one of the most successful entrepreneurs of a generation.Of course, past success isn't a guarantee of future success.Even Tesla's position as the global leader of electric vehicles is under threat from Chinese rivals, such as BYD. It outsold the U.S. EV maker in Europe for the first time last month.Musk, who has long praised his Chinese competitors, claimed he wasn't following the sales race. ""I don't really think about competitors,"" Musk said on CNBC. ""I just think about making the products as perfect as possible.""He just needs to execute.Write to Tim Higgins at tim.higgins@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250524001145:0/

The Food and Drug Administration will stick to its existing process for updating Covid-19 shots for older adults and those at a high risk of severe illness. It's a softer approach than Trump officials had seemed poised to take, according to Barron's reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis.Home Depot, the biggest home-improvement retailer, reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.56 a share, missing analysts' estimates of $3.60. Revenue of $39.9 billion beat forecasts of $39.3 billion. The company said it plans to keep prices unchanged despite new tariffs. Home Depot shares were down 0.6%. Competitor Lowe's, which reports quarterly earnings Wednesday, fell 1.4%.Tesla was up 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk told a conference in Qatar that he expects to still be chief executive in five years, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla shares have declined 15% this year but have jumped about 44% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 22.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Tesla Just Made It Nearly Impossible for Small Investors to Sue The Company's Executive,1747686571000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA just rewrote the rules of the gameagain. In a recent SEC filing, the company announced it will now block shareholders who own less than 3% of its stock from filing derivative lawsuits against its executives or board. That threshold? About 97 million shares, or roughly $34 billion at Friday's close. This follows Tesla's shift from Delaware to Texas incorporation, where a new law gives companies the green light to set their own barriers to such lawsuitssomething Delaware doesn't allow.The timing isn't lost on anyone. Back in 2018, Richard Tornetta filed suit over Elon Musk's massive $56 billion pay package, owning just nine shares. A Delaware judge sided with Tornetta last year, voiding the package and calling it unfair to shareholders. Musk is now appealing. But with Tesla's new bylaw in place, future Tornettas might not even get through the door. It's a preemptive shield, born in Texas, that could reshape how corporate power is challengedif it's challenged at all.For investors, this move could cut both ways. On one hand, it limits legal distractions and could streamline decision-making. On the other, it raises questions about checks and balances at one of the world's most closely watched companies. If this approach catches on with other Texas-incorporated firms, it may mark the start of a broader shiftone where only the biggest shareholders get a seat in the courtroom.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8d520adb4094b:0-tesla-just-made-it-nearly-impossible-for-small-investors-to-sue-the-company-s-executive/

Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe.

Shares of the electric-vehicle company closed up 1.9% on Thursday, even as the Trump tax-and-spending bill that was passed by the House of Representatives included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay annual fees, while the Republican-led Senate voted to revoke a California measure that banned the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. On Friday, Wedbush analysts maintained their Outperform rating on the stock and raised their price target to $500 from $350.Intuit, the owner of TurboTax and Credit Karma, rose 8% after boosting its fiscal-year outlook following stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue. The company expects fiscal-year revenue of $18.72 billion to $18.76 billion, an increase of 15% from a year earlier compared with previous guidance that called for a revenue jump of 12% to 13%.Workday reported first-quarter adjusted earnings that beat analysts' estimates as subscription revenue rose 13% to about $2.06 billion. The software company said it anticipates second-quarter subscription revenue of $2.16 billion — up nearly 14% from a year earlier, but slightly below forecasts. Shares fell 12.5%.Nuclear energy stocks surged after President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders that were meant to kickstart the production of nuclear power in the U.S., including a directive to speed up the construction of advanced reactors at federal sites.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent.

Elon Musk says ‘I don’t follow BYD’ — but the Chinese EV giant is hard to ignore,1747771607000,"“I don’t follow BYD” – that’s what Elon Musk said in a recent interview with CNBC.The billionaire chief executive of Tesla Inc NASDAQ:TSLA also went on to state that he doesn’t think about competitors at all. His entire focus is solely on making the TSLA product as perfect as humanly possible.While the aforementioned comment reflects Musk’s commitment to innovation, ignoring rivals, particularly BYD, could prove a misstep on his part. Here’s why.BYD’s market dominanceBYD has already surpassed Tesla Inc to become the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles – and that’s when it doesn’t even sell its vehicles in the world’s second-largest auto market, the US.While the multinational based out of Austin, Texas, was once the undisputed leader in the EV space, BYD’s rapid expansion, including the assembly lines it has already established in Brazil, Hungary, Thailand, and Uzbekistan, signals its intent to dominate globally.Elon Musk himself acknowledged recently that without trade barriers, BYD could “demolish most other car companies.” So, if Tesla doesn’t track BYD’s moves, it could end up losing ground in key markets.BYD’s cost advantageBYD’s ability to produce EVs at significantly lower costs is a major threat to Tesla Inc. In fact, experts are now convinced that “no one can match BYD on price, period.”Tesla’s premium pricing strategy works in some markets, but affordability is a key driver of mass adoption. Therefore, if the US electric vehicles behemoth doesn’t analyse BYD’s cost-saving strategies, it may struggle to compete in price-sensitive regions.That’s part of the reason why TSLA is already finding it incrementally more difficult to expand its share in China, which, according to Elon Musk, is “the most competitive auto market.”BYD’s technological advancementsBYD has established itself globally as much more than just a budget EV maker with innovations that sometimes seem light years ahead of its rivals.But if he still ignores BYD’s tech advancements, TSLA risks being blindsided by innovations that could redefine the market. Plus, BYD is offering multiple levels of autonomy on its vehicles for a fraction of the cost compared to Tesla, and its latest charging technology claims to charge an EV in less than 5 minutes, versus 15 minutes for TSLA.Note that analysts are already losing faith in Tesla stock, given the consensus rating currently sits at “hold,” with the average price target indicating potential downside of nearly 20% from here.China’s EV dominanceFinally, China is the world’s largest EV market, and BYD benefits from solid government support. Between 2015 and 2020, BYD received $4.3 billion in state subsidies.Tesla must monitor how BYD leverages this advantage to expand globally. So, ignoring BYD or not following it, as Musk claimed in a CNBC interview today, is not an option.The billionaire must track its strategies, pricing, and innovations to ensure Tesla Inc remains competitive in the evolving EV landscape.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:38e0c86e7094b:0-elon-musk-says-i-don-t-follow-byd-but-the-chinese-ev-giant-is-hard-to-ignore/
Trump Tax Bill Could 'Devastate' Clean Energy. Here Are the Few Bright Spots. — Barrons.com,1748027340000,"By Avi SalzmanInvestors knew that President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would be bad for clean energy. Subsidies for projects like solar and wind farms were bound to be gutted to pay for tax cuts. But the bill that passed the House of Representatives on Thursday was worse than most of them expected.There's a very gloomy future ahead in some areas if the bill isn't changed dramatically in the Senate.""This bill is going to be devastating to the industry if it's passed by the Senate,"" said Heather Cooper, a lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery who works with clean energy companies. ""It takes the tax credits that have been in the code for decades, and that were extended and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act, and it essentially repeals pretty much all of those incentives almost immediately for almost all types of projects.""Cooper said her clients were ""jaw-dropped and dumbfounded that this went through.""""This is a highly robust industry with hundreds of thousands of workers and employees,"" she said. A Princeton University analysis found that the bill almost entirely repeals the Inflation Reduction Act, which would jeopardize more than $500 billion of already-announced clean energy manufacturing projects.Cooper's clients are hopeful that the Senate will change the bill significantly, but she's less optimistic.Certain clean energy industries would get hit harder than others. The worst-hit areas appear to be rooftop solar and electric vehicles, which would quickly lose financial support that they had counted on for years. Areas that appear to have survived with less damage include biofuels, nuclear energy, and carbon capture. But all of those industries have their own problems beyond the bill.Rooftop solarThe bill removes a rooftop solar tax credit that allowed homeowners to take a credit worth 30% of the value of the project. It also limits how companies that lease solar panels to consumers can claim tax credits — an unexpected change that would have a particularly dramatic effect on SunRun, the leader in that industry. It also forbids companies from selling the tax credits to other buyers, taking away a mechanism that had greased the wheels of the industry.SunRun stock fell 37% on Thursday. BMO Markets analyst Ameet Thakkar downgraded SunRun's shares to Underperform and predicted that there will be ""limited political will to claw back residential credits in any Senate version."" Sunnova, another company that leases solar panels to customers, warned investors earlier this year that there's a chance it will not be able to stay in business — even before this bill was finalized.Electric vehiclesMost kinds of EVs will lose access to $7,500 tax credits that will make them less price-competitive against gasoline-powered cars. The bill would also add new fees to buyers of certain low-emission vehicles, adding charges of $250 a year for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids. The EV boom had already begun to slow, but the new costs and loss of tax breaks will almost certainly slow sales further. Tesla may weather the changes better than peers who have a smaller customer base, but it could still be hurt.Utility-scale solarUtilities install large arrays of solar panels to generate electricity. The bill will quickly remove the tax credits they receive for installing them, making them less cost-competitive with fossil-fuel-powered generators, like natural gas plants. Clean energy projects would have to start up within 60 days of passage of the bill to still be eligible.Cooper said her clients who install panels are in a rush to get equipment and get projects started.""I suspect every module manufacturer has gotten 100 phone calls today,"" she said. ""There's gonna be a lot of activity as people scramble to engage in activities in the next 60-something days.""The changes could have an impact on big utility-scale installers like NextEra Energy and AES, whose stocks fell sharply Thursday. Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith downgraded AES stock to Underperform on Tuesday, citing its ""difficult path forward"".Clean energy manufacturingThe bill was mostly a negative for companies that manufacture clean energy products like batteries and solar panels in the United States. It will phase outthe credits supporting manufacturing more quickly than expected, and impose strict rules to forbid tax breaks to companies that rely on Chinese suppliers and other ""foreign entities of concern.""That's particularly bad for battery makers, who are heavily dependent on China. First Solar, which manufactures solar panels for utilities in the U.S., should benefit from the domestic manufacturing rules. But First Solar will likely be hurt by a drop in demand for solar because of the removal of tax credits available to utilities for installing it.WindWind power is and has been in a deep rut. The bill takes away its tax credits, and sunsets credits for wind manufacturing even faster than solar. Wind equipment companies like Vestas will have to rely on overseas business for now. The one bright spot is that the stocks were already beaten down, so they reflect very low expectations.BiofuelsCredits for the production of biofuels from plant and animal byproducts survived the House bill, and production credits were even extended by an extra year. Midwestern congressional representatives like those credits, which help farmers.That political support would seem to be a boon for biofuels players like Darling Industries, Calumet and Neste. But those companies have other problems right now that make them shaky investments, and have sent all the stocks lower this year. There simply isn't enough demand for biofuels, and they're not cost-competitive when gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices are cheap like they are today. Other Trump administration policies that pull back support for clean energy are also hurting the industry.NuclearCredits for nuclear energy mostly survived the House bill, though one crucial credit will fade away a year earlier than expected.Both Democrats and Republicans favor nuclear energy, and have called for a ""renaissance."" And the credits' survival is a good sign for owners of existing nuclear reactors, like Constellation Energy.A separate production tax credit available to nuclear power is only available to projects that start construction by the end of 2028 — a relatively short timeline for companies that can take many years to get all the permits and financing. And the tax credits don't solve the bigger problem for nuclear, which is finding utilities, lenders, and a customer base who are willing to take on the financial risk of developing new reactors. Until those issues are cleared up, start-ups like Oklo and Nuscale could still face challenges.Carbon captureThe bill also continues to support carbon capture, a process that involves siphoning off carbon emissions from industrial plants and oil wells, and then liquefying the carbon and storing it underground. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil have been investing in the area, and could profit off the credits. But demand for carbon capture is still scarce, and Trump's rollback of other environmental rules calls into question whether companies will continue to pursue low-carbon strategies.There also aren't many ways for investors to buy into the industry. Occidental Petroleum, the oil company that is farthest along in its carbon-capture efforts, has other problems that have sunk its stock in recent years, like high indebtedness.Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Stock Is Falling. There's a New Board Member. — Barrons.com,1747660020000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling early Monday.

He will serve on the audit committee and his appointment is effective on June 1.Hartung spent a quarter-century at Chipotle, starting when the restaurant chain had less than 200 stores. Today, Chipotle has more than 3,700 locations.The move, for now, expands Tesla's board to nine. The other members are board chair Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, J.B. Straubel, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and of course, Elon Musk.Tesla also included the disclosure that a son-in-law of Hartung has been a ""non-executive, salaried employee of Tesla since December 2016, and does not share a household with Mr. Hartung.""Expansion of the board with outside finance experience will likely be seen as a positive for the company, although board members don't typically move stocks.

China's Factory Boom Can't Hide a Crumbling Consumer Engine,1747659462000,"Industrial output in China just beat expectationsbut investors aren't celebrating yet. Factories posted a solid 6.1% year-on-year growth in April, surprising to the upside despite trade war aftershocks. But consumer spending? That's where the story softens. Retail sales came in weaker than expected at 5.1%, and car salestypically a reliable growth driverbarely moved. Even with subsidies in play, Chinese households are still hesitant to open their wallets, pointing to broader issues with wage growth, job security, and ongoing deflationary pressure.The property market remains a drag. Investment in real estate continues to fall, home prices are slipping faster, and household savings are hitting record highs as consumers shift more cash into time deposits. That's not a great sign for domestic demand. Infrastructure is holding up thanks to government bond issuance, but manufacturing investment is beginning to look shaky. Trade may have gotten a temporary breather from the 90-day US tariff pause, but uncertainty around the next phase could still weigh on corporate planning. Exporters have been rerouting shipments to Southeast Asia and Europebut that workaround has its limits.Even so, the resilience in China's factory data has prompted analysts at Nomura, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan to raise their 2025 growth forecasts to around 4.5%. That's still shy of Beijing's 5% target. For companies like Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and others deeply tied to China's economic health, the picture remains nuanced: production is holding up, but without a real revival in consumer confidence, the runway for sustainable growth could be shorter than hoped. The next few monthsespecially with policymakers hinting at more supportcould be critical in setting the tone for the rest of the year.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:91a731d1b094b:0-china-s-factory-boom-can-t-hide-a-crumbling-consumer-engine/
Elon Musk Shores Up Tesla Leadership and Starlink Plans,1747769704000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA commits Musk's five-year horizon, teases Starlink IPO prospects. Tesla vows Elon Musk will remain CEO through 2030, providing more definitive leadership visibility amid concerns over his political engagements and time split with SpaceX and the Trump Administration.Despite personal blowback from his interventionist statements, Musk said he did what needed to be done, noting that the brand has offset some political fallout with additional sales from right-leaning buyers, even as delivery reports have shown steep declines in North America and Europe. He plans to dial back political spending after forthcoming election defeats and defended his dual roles, underscoring that his commitment to Tesla is ironclad over the next five years.On the SpaceX front, Musk added that Starlink may pursue an IPO eventually, though he's in no rush, highlighting growing confidence in the satellite-internet business after adding roughly 2 million subscribers worldwide. He also confirmed he'll press ahead with his lawsuit against OpenAI, despite the AI pioneer partially reversing its for-profit restructuring plan. Musk's remarks come as investors and analysts grapple with how his political profile and multi-company leadership might influence brand perception and operational focus.Why It Matters: Locking in Musk's CEO tenure for another half-decade reduces one major uncertainty for investors, while Starlink's eventual public listing could unlock substantial value outside Tesla. Tesla stock has taken a hit, with analysts' average 12-month target now at $285.79 that's an 18.6% downside from current levels. The spread is wild though: some see it heading as high as $452, while others think it could crater to just $19. That kind of divergence screams uncertainty.

Why Tesla’s 60% Surge Should Keep Going Into Summer,1747659300000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:TSLA] Shares of Tesla Inc. NASDAQ:TSLA closed just under $350 last week , capping off a blistering rally that has seen the stock climb 60% from its April lows. While it still has ground to cover before revisiting the highs near $500 from last December, momentum is clearly back . The company is starting to look more like Tesla, which energized investors in 2020 and 2021: ambitious, dynamic, and positioned for long-term dominance.Much of this move began after the company's latest earnings report in late April. Though the results fell short of Wall Street's expectations on a headline basis, the update cleared a cloud of uncertainty over the stock. Since then, sentiment has flipped decisively, with retail and institutional investors jumping back in.Musk Refocuses and Markets ApproveIn addition to the shift in sentiment post-earnings , CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he would be stepping back from White House-related efforts to dedicate more time to Tesla has also helped calm investor nerves. With confidence restored in leadership focus, the narrative quickly returned to the company's product pipeline, growth initiatives , and competitive advantages.The improving mood has now been supercharged by broader macro headlines, specifically around U.S. and China trade tensions . Developments suggesting a rollback of certain tariffs have helped power the latest leg higher, particularly given how sensitive Tesla's supply chain and demand dynamics are to the global EV ecosystem.$1 Trillion Market Cap ReclaimedTesla's valuation has surged in tandem with its share price. Last week, the company reclaimed a $1 trillion market cap for the first time in months, adding psychological weight to the rally. Market cap milestones don't impact fundamentals directly, but they do influence narrative, and the narrative right now is one of resurgence.At the technical level, shares are trading in a strong uptrend. The stock has cleared key  heavy-volume resistance points , and momentum indicators continue strengthening. The RSI is now around 70 , indicating overbought conditions, but not yet at the type of extended levels that would typically flash warning signs. This momentum could extend through the summer with the bulls firmly in contro l.Analysts Are Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:TSLA] The recent wave of analyst upgrades adds further weight to the bullish outlook. Last week, Mizuho's Vijay Rakesh boosted his price target on Tesla to $390 from $325, maintaining an Outperform rating . Rakesh cited the positive impact of easing trade tensions, particularly concerning electric vehicle parts imports, as a key driver.While he flagged the potential headwind of reduced EV subsidies in the U.S., he maintained a confident view of Tesla's macro setup and growth path  in the automotive space.This echoes Piper Sandler's move earlier this month when they issued a fresh $400 target on the stock . Taken together, these revised outlooks point to a growing consensus: Tesla's upside may only just be reawakening.Even after the recent run, these targets imply 12% to 15% additional upside , with some bulls calling for more if economic conditions remain favorable.Room to Run Into the SummerOne of the most encouraging aspects of Tesla's rebound is how balanced the rally has been. This isn't just a short squeeze or a speculative pop; it's a sustained move supported by technicals, macro tailwinds, and analyst validation . If trade headlines continue to improve, and the company delivers on growth metrics in the second half of the year, the stock could continue pushing toward those higher price targets.While the relative strength index is something to monitor, the current positioning suggests any short-term pullback could be shallow and met with eager buying. With institutional sentiment turning more positive and Tesla returning to a leadership role in tech, investors are beginning to price in a scenario where the stock retests and potentially surpasses its previous highs .Why This Rally May Still Be in Its Early StagesTesla has already made a 60% move in a matter of weeks, but the catalysts behind the rally suggest it may still be in the early days.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his right-wing political views and his work for U.S. President Donald Trump. Musk has said he will reduce his work for Trump and focus on Tesla. ""My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days, every few weeks, and to be helpful where I can be helpful,"" he said. A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.""The only things that matter in the long term are autonomy and Optimus,"" Musk told CNBC.Autonomous vehicle technology has been hard to commercialize, with tight regulations and heavy investments forcing many companies to give up. Those still in the race, including Alphabet's Waymo, have faced increased scrutiny.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating collisions involving Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance software in reduced roadway visibility conditions since October. The U.S. road safety regulator asked Tesla last week to answer questions on its paid robotaxi service launch to assess how the cars will perform in poor weather.Tesla is in talks with major automakers to license the FSD software that is expected to underpin its robotaxis, Musk said.To power his broader artificial intelligence vision, Musk's xAI startup has been ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models, and its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called ""Colossus,"" is touted as the world's largest. xAI will deploy a million of Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA advanced Blackwell chips at a new facility near Memphis, Musk said. ""So long as Nvidia is better than what we make, we'll keep buying from Nvidia,"" he said. xAI bought a 1-million -square-foot property in Southwest Memphis, Tennessee, the Greater Memphis Chamber said in March.

Stocks Decline Pre-Bell as Moody's Downgrades US Credit Ratings,1747654589000,"The benchmark US stock measures were trending downwards before the opening bell Monday as investors assessed Moody's downgrade of the world's largest economy's credit ratings. The S&P 500 declined 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 0.8%, and the Nasdaq fell 1.6% in premarket activity. The indexes finished Friday's trading session higher, with the S&P 500 recording gains for the fifth consecutive day. Moody's on Friday lowered the US government's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Aa1 from Aaa and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The downgrade reflects the increase in government debt and interest payment ratios over more than a decade ""to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" according to Moody's. The downgrade comes as the US and China recently agreed to suspend most duties on each other's goods for 90 days. The two countries had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in the March quarter, representing the first drop since the first quarter of 2022, government data showed late April. US Treasury yields moved higher in premarket action, with the two-year rate inclining 2.1 basis points to 4% and the 10-year rate advancing about 11 basis points to 4.54%. The 30-year rate climbed 12 basis points to more than 5%.

Musk also made it clear: this isn't about the money. It's a reasonable control thing, he said, pushing back on the idea that his push for more Tesla shares is rooted in wealth accumulation.On the business front, Musk downplayed Tesla's recent stumbles, claiming the company's downturn has already turned around. While sales remain weak in Europe, he argued other regions are holding strong and doesn't expect any meaningful shortfall. Investors seemed to like the optimism Tesla shares popped 2.4% at 12.38pm. That bounce offers a breather after the stock shed 14% this year amid concerns about EV demand, pricing pressure, and leadership distractions.Musk also addressed the elephant in the room: his politics. He admitted past political spending may have hurt Tesla's appeal on the left, but claimed it gained support elsewhere. Looking ahead, Musk said he plans to spend a lot less on politics, signaling a shift back toward focus and execution. His parting message?

Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

South Africa's Ramaphosa aims to mend US ties with Musk business push,1747651726000,"South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa plans to discuss business opportunities for Elon Musk's companies during a visit to Washington this week aimed at mending relations with U.S. President Donald Trump , Ramaphosa's spokesperson said on Monday.Trump has taken aim at South Africa during his second term, citing disapproval of its land reform policy and of its genocide case against U.S. ally Israel before the International Court of Justice. His administration cut funding to the country in February and last week granted refugee status to a group of white South Africans it said were facing racial discrimination - a claim the South African government denies.The two heads of state are scheduled to meet on Wednesday. And South African officials have been preparing a trade proposal to present to Trump to reset the relationship. One potential proposal would be for Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA - led by Musk, a close ally and adviser to Trump - to receive favourable tariffs on its imports into South Africa in exchange for building electric vehicle charging stations. ""(It) could be one of the points discussed,"" Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said in response to a text message query on the matter.Asked about the question of licencing for Musk's satellite company Starlink, Magwenya said: ""Certainly, the issue will be discussed."" The United States has pushed some nations facing tariffs to approve Starlink, the Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing State Department cables. Musk, who is South African-born, has previously claimed Starlink was barred from operating in South Africa because he is not Black, an allegation South African officials refuted. South Africa's telecoms regulator said in March that Starlink had not applied for a licence.Musk's false claim appeared to be taking a swipe at local Black Economic Empowerment rules, requiring foreign-owned telecommunications licencees to sell 30% of the equity in their local subsidiaries to historically disadvantaged groups.South Africa's Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen, part of the delegation travelling to the United States on Monday, said he wanted to secure trade benefits for South African farmers.South African agricultural products currently enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Under Trump's tariff regime, however, that is now at risk.""Losing these benefits would be disastrous for farmers, farm workers and the economy at large,"" Steenhuisen said in a statement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RR0DA:0-south-africa-s-ramaphosa-aims-to-mend-us-ties-with-musk-business-push/"

Markets Beware Progress of Tax and Spending Bill. How Stocks Can Get Hit. — Barrons.com,1747651560000,"When it comes to tackling the government's budget deficit, there are a lot of politicians in Washington who are good at talking the talk, but very few who walk the walk.Just as Congress is trying to push through its latest tax plan, Moody's has downgraded U.S. debt. Combined with comments yesterday from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reminding everyone that tariffs could go back up again, that's a one-two punch that could make investors nervous this week.In a way, the downgrade is purely symbolic. Moody's is the last of the three main ratings firms to do it. And the reasons given are obvious — tax cuts are reducing revenue while spending continues to increase. Despite all the rhetoric about fiscal rectitude, even the latest proposal cuts taxes way more than it reduces spending — and those spending cuts may not hold, since popular programs like Medicaid are being targeted.Some say deficits don't matter. They're right, with one big caveat. They don't matter as long as bond yields stay low.So far, so good. The 10-year Treasury yield is still at around 4.5% — about the same as where it was a year ago. But if budget worries start pushing that yield up significantly, watch out. That will drive down stocks as well as bonds.That's because higher yields reduce the relative valuation of stocks, increase companies' borrowing costs, and ultimately slow economic growth. As Friday's consumer sentiment data showed, shoppers are already worried. A warning from Walmart that prices could rise in the wake of a tariff hit does not help. Earnings from Home Depot, Lowe's, and Target this week will add some more color.For now, deficit worries may well just be hot air in a storm that blows over. But keep an eye on bond yields to learn when all the talk gets real.- Brian Swint*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R. Rublin and deputy editor Ben Levisohn today at noon when they discuss the outlook for financial markets, industry sectors, and individual stocks. Sign up here.***Bessent Dismisses Moody's U.S. Debt Downgrade as 'Lagging Indicator'Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent played down worries about Moody's decision late Friday to downgrade U.S. sovereign debt from AAA status to Aa1, telling NBC News on Sunday that ratings firm actions are ""a lagging indicator."" He blamed federal spending during the Biden administration for what Moody's cited in its reasoning.- Moody's was the last major credit-rating firm to downgrade U.S. debt, warning it is on a trajectory to increase federal government spending. Lawmakers are trying to extend President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which could add $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. - Markets have likely absorbed some of the reaction given that the U.S. hasn't had a perfect AAA rating across all major agencies for some time, said Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. He expects the impact to be minimal. - Recent Treasury auctions show net buying of U.S. debt by indirect bidders such as central banks, according to Ben Emons, chief investment officer and founder of FedWatch Advisors. Weekly Japanese Ministry of Finance data also shows Japan continuing U.S. Treasury purchases. - Trump's temporary pause of 145% tariffs on goods from China improved the macroeconomic outlook considerably, reducing recession risk and helping lift stock markets into positive territory for the year. But Treasury yields also rose from 4.1% back to nearly 4.5%. What's Next: Inflation data doesn't yet reflect the higher tariff levels that were in place in China for more than a month before last week's reprieve. Higher inflation could keep Treasury yields elevated as the Fed hesitates to cut interest rates, which could also pressure U.S. stocks, Emons said.- Laura Sanicola and Janet H. Cho***More Retailers Expected to Detail Effects of Tariffs This WeekAnalysts will listen closely to Target, Home Depot and other retailers reporting earnings this week, especially what they say about how tariffs will affect prices. Walmart said last week that it would have to raise prices to counteract rising costs from tariffs, something President Donald Trump told it to ""eat.""- Tariffs have been discussed on corporate earnings calls in the past two months the most in a decade, according to FactSet. Along the same vein, the word ""uncertainty"" has come up the most since 2020, the year the pandemic hit. Mentions of the word ""recession"" are their highest since the end of 2022. - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday he has spoken with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who said last week the retailer would raise prices in response to tariffs. Trump criticized McMillon's comments in a social media post Saturday telling Walmart to ""eat"" the tariffs and stop blaming them for rising prices. - Bessent told CNN's State of the Union that Walmart would be absorbing some of the tariffs, while acknowledging that ""some may get passed onto consumers."" But he added that inflation was down, notably in the retail price of gasoline. - Trump has insisted that the cost of U.S. tariffs on imported goods won't be borne by American consumers, despite what business leaders have been saying. Last week, the Western-wear retailer Boot Barn highlighted strong sales trends but also said demand -- and its margins -- could take a hit from tariffs. What's Next: After pausing his so-called reciprocal tariffs while bilateral trade deals are discussed, Trump now says various countries will be getting letters telling them what the tariffs on their goods will be. Bessent warned tariff rates of 10% to 49% could come back for countries that don't negotiate in good faith.- Liz Moyer***Tesla's Chinese Deliveries Will Be Closely WatchedTesla has been trying to recover from a brand backlash related to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, and another reading on its progress could come this week, with an update on the electric-vehicle maker's Chinese deliveries. Wall Street is closely watching, and analysts might need to revise second-quarter sales forecasts.- Musk promised in April that he would leave behind his work slashing the federal government and renew his focus on Tesla, where first-quarter delivery numbers fell 13% from a year earlier. Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver 7% fewer cars in the second quarter than a year ago. - Second-quarter sales were looking weak in China in the first six weeks of the quarter, based on registration data that said they fell about 26% from a year ago. April sales in European markets including France, Germany, and the U.K., fell about 49% from a year ago, after dropping 45% in the first quarter. - A figure of 13,000 deliveries in China for the week would be close to flat from a year ago and a sign that things are normalizing, while a figure below 13,000 would make Wall Street analysts reconsider second-quarter estimates. - General Motors is pushing to eliminate or modify California's EV targets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a memo sent to employees. California wants 35% of new car sales to be EVs or plug-in hybrids in 2026, and to eliminate gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. Eleven states are following its model. What's Next: California's EV goals are lofty considering current sales penetration rates are still far below its targets. GM told Barron's in an email that it continues to focus on offering the best and broadest portfolio of vehicles on the market and that it has long supported consistency in emissions regulations.- Al Root and Janet H. Cho***Crypto Industry Hopes for Victory on Stablecoins. What What Comes Next.The crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.- As soon as today, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets such as Treasury bills. - Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and give holders of coins priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy. Stablecoins, with a market value of $250 billion, underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. - The largest stablecoin, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global. Currently used mostly for trading, issuers think stablecoins could challenge traditional payments networks. - There are some issues with the industry's push. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. Second is President Donald Trump. He and his family could profit from majority ownership of stablecoin issuer World Liberty Financial. What's Next: The crypto industry has a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and crypto token issuers. Trump has been more crypto friendly than the Biden administration, but the industry is concerned regulation will get stricter without rules around how they are policed.- Joe Light***Buffett Won't Be on Stage Next Berkshire Meeting: Report It looks like Berkshire Hathaway's 2026 annual meeting in Omaha will be the Greg Abel show. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett won't be on stage to answer shareholder questions next year, according to a report.- Abel, 62, is set to take over as CEO at the beginning of next year. Buffett's daughter Susan, a member of the Berkshire board, told The Omaha World-Herald newspaper that her father felt it was appropriate for Abel to be on stage without him, given Abel's future role. - ""I'm not going to be up there,"" she recalled him saying. ""I'm going to leave it to Greg."" Barron's has reached out to Berkshire for comment. - Buffett surprised Berkshire investors on May 3 when he said he would be stepping down as CEO at year-end. Buffett answered questions for four-and-a-half hours at the recent gathering, and many Berkshire investors would have liked to see him on stage another year. - Some investors thought Buffett would agree to appear in 2026 on stage to help the city of Omaha, which generates considerable revenue from the huge crowd at the annual meeting. An estimated 40,000 people attended the 2025 meeting, but it's likely that number will shrink next year without Buffett. What's Next: An Abel-oriented Q&A session is likely to have one key benefit — more Berkshire-related questions. Many shareholders who would like to better understand the complex and diversified conglomerate have been frustrated that many questions at the annual meeting are unrelated to the company — for example, one of the first questions at the 2025 meeting was about a hot-dog business that a shareholder thought Berkshire owned but is actually owned by Berkshire Partners, a private-equity firm.- Andrew Bary***MarketWatch Wants to Hear From YouClasses and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.

Best-Performing ETFs of Last Week,1747645740000,"U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, marking the fifth consecutive day of gains and capping off a robust week for Wall Street. Investors brushed off disappointing consumer sentiment data and lingering inflation concerns to quite an extent. The S&P 500 added 5.3%, the Dow Jones advanced 3.4% and the Nasdaq rose 7.2% last week.Technology stocks powered much of the rally. NVIDIA NVDA and Tesla TSLA shares surged last week, due to Trump's Middle East dealmaking tour. Saudi Arabia approved the use of SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service for aviation and maritime use. Musk also said he plans to bring robotaxis to the country. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will send 18,000 AI chips to Saudi Arabia.Consumer Sentiment Slips, Inflation Expectations RiseDespite the market's gains, economic data revealed persistent consumer unease. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to its second-lowest level on record. Moreover, consumers now anticipate prices to rise by 7.3% over the next year, indicating an increase from 6.5% the previous month.Trade Truce Eases Investor FearsInvestor sentiment was buoyed by a 90-day tariff truce between U.S. and Chinese officials, calming fears of an escalating trade war. The agreement helped drive risk-on behavior and renewed confidence in the markets.“Markets are repricing the stagflation risk right now,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, as quoted on CNBC. “The U.S. consumer may say he/she is worried, but they aren’t spending like they are. Consumption trumps all once you filter out all the noise.”Looking Ahead: Tariff Uncertainty RemainsWhile the truce brought temporary relief, trade uncertainty looms. President Donald Trump announced that his administration will begin sending letters to various countries outlining new tariff rates within the next two to three weeks. These letters would replace direct negotiations in cases where time constraints exist.Winning ETFs in FocusAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of last week.YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF SMCY – Up 27.6% last weekThe YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF seeks current income and exposure to the share price of the common stock of Super Micro Computer, Inc., subject to a limit on potential investment gains.

The Top Corporate Board Directors — Journal Report,1747614660000,"By Theo FrancisThey oversee airlines, oil companies, home-improvement chains and makers of products ranging from deodorant to fighter jets. About half are CEOs, or once were. Roughly as many identify as women or racial or ethnic minorities.They are the 250 most influential and effective directors at big, publicly traded U.S. companies, as ranked in the inaugural Wall Street Journal Top Board Directors listing.At the very top: Edward Philip, the independent chairman of United Airlines. Philip made his name in executive roles at Lycos, a pioneering internet search company, and went on to head operations for Partners In Health, the global nonprofit bringing medical care to some of the world's poorest places.Joining Philip as the five highest-ranked directors are Home Depot's Stephanie Linnartz, who once ran sportswear brand Under Armour; Debra Reed-Klages, a former utility-company CEO on the boards of Caterpillar, Chevron and Lockheed Martin; Joseph Jimenez, a former Novartis CEO who is lead director at Procter & Gamble and on the boards of General Motors and Century Therapeutics; and Gregory Boyce, a former coal-company CEO on the board of mining company Newmont.""We're in an increasingly complex world where corporate leadership is being called on to grapple with all kinds of challenges and opportunities,"" says Rick Wartzman, co-president of Bendable Labs, the research and consulting firm that created the ranking for The Wall Street Journal Leadership Institute. ""Directors are being called on to take an ever more important role.""To find the most effective and influential directors, Bendable analyzed data on more than 4,000 nonemployee directors of S&P 500 companies, as well as data on those companies and others at which the directors served. The analysis took into account a range of third-party scores, including company performance, activist vulnerability and corporate governance, as well as data on directors' backgrounds and their roles within their boards. (See more methodology details here.)""So much of what happens in board deliberations and in board meetings, we really don't know,"" Wartzman says. ""We tried to take what is public and available and where there are credible third-party assessments of different risks to a company where boards seemed to have an important role to play.""The ranking seeks to shed light on a longstanding but elusive question in corporate governance: What makes a good director?The rise of independentsFor decades, directors even at the largest publicly traded companies were often appointed from the ranks of big shareholders, upper management and their associates in business and society. These days, no more than one or two members of the C-suite sit around the boardroom table, and most or all of the other directors count as independent under the rules of the markets the company's shares trade on. (Those rules don't cover every kind of potential conflict.)Yet boards remain notoriously difficult to evaluate. Directors oversee the company for shareholders, but management is responsible for execution. Beyond formal securities disclosures and corporate reports, it can be hard to draw a bead on what boards do. Most seek consensus and minimize disagreement, especially in public.Ultimately, corporate boards are like firehouses, says B. Espen Eckbo, a Dartmouth College finance professor who ran its corporate-governance center for two decades. Until there's a fire, it is hard to know how well they function.""The company runs itself in good times — but when it gets to some times with fires, then the board has to really step up and save the company from making big mistakes,"" says Eckbo, who wasn't involved in the Journal's ranking. ""The best way to go about it is to create a board that thinks like shareholders.""Academic research hasn't found strong evidence for director characteristics that contribute directly to company performance, although most experts believe that sizable stock ownership likely spurs directors to think more like the shareholders they represent, and that having an outside CEO on the board seems to help, but more than one isn't necessarily better.CEO experience makes directors more sensitive to the challenges faced by executives — and to the line between the board's role and the chief executive's, says Lloyd Carney, No. 73 on the list and a longtime tech executive who currently chairs the board of Grid Dynamics and sits on the boards of Visa and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.""Hire the CEO, support the CEO, fire the CEO if you have to, and always guide the long-term strategy,"" Carney says. ""The last thing you want is the board flying in every three months trying to tell you how to run the business.""Parsing the dataIn the Journal's ranking, the 250 top directors vary in the length and breadth of their board service. About half the directors sit on just one board, as do seven of the top 10 directors, while most of the rest sit on two; only a few dozen directors sit on three or four (45 and 11, respectively). Among the directors sitting on four are former Alcatel-Lucent CEO Patricia Russo, who is on the boards of Merck, General Motors, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and KKR.Half a dozen directors on the list have held a seat for at least a quarter-century — including longtime tech executive and investor Harvey Jones, an Nvidia director since 1993, and Russo, who has been on the board of Merck and predecessor Schering-Plough since 1995. Another 17 took at least one of their seats within the past year or so, including Marissa Mayer, the former Yahoo chief executive who joined AT&T's board last year. (The ranking only considers directors set to serve terms through year-end 2025.)Directors in the ranking had no role in creating it, though some are expected to be unpaid participants in a new conference series by the WSJ Leadership Institute.In all, 48 companies have at least three directors among the top 250. Home Depot and Allstate have nine apiece, while Procter & Gamble has eight and Wells Fargo has seven — in each case, majorities of each board.""Part of what makes a great board is constructive collaboration with each other and with management,"" says Linnartz, who sits on Home Depot's audit and compensation committees.At Home Depot, each director meets quarterly with a member of senior management, whether to tour stores or dig into some operational challenge, getting to know the business deeply.When the coronavirus pandemic hit two years after she joined Home Depot's board, the board's familiarity with the company and its systematic strategic planning were evident, says Linnartz. The foundation was in place for a rapid expansion of the company's business to meet demand.Individual vs. corporate factorsCompany characteristics and results play a small part in the ranking, contributing around 10% of each director's score on average. A one-year total shareholder return that surpassed other companies in the same industry, or the S&P 500 as a whole, boosted scores, while measures of poor audit quality, activist vulnerability and high-profile controversies reduced them.More influential: a measure of corporate prominence, based on the company's ranking in Fortune Magazine's list of the biggest and most influential companies, which accounted for around a fifth of the average combined score.Individual characteristics were the biggest driver in the ranking, contributing about two-thirds of directors' final scores on average.In some cases, a strong individual score made up for a poor company showing: Donald Knauss, a director of Target, McKesson and Kellanova, ranked No. 13 overall despite low corporate scores brought on by audit-quality penalties at all three companies, and penalties for activist vulnerability and litigation at McKesson and Target. Helping him: past CEO experience, serving on the boards of three such prominent companies, and leadership roles on each of the boards, including serving as lead director at Kellanova and board chairman at McKesson.Many of the highest-scoring directors got there in part by serving on or chairing at least one of three key board committees: the audit committee, tasked with a range of financial oversight; the compensation committee, which sets CEO pay; and the nomination committee, which vets candidates for board seats.The five top-ranked directors, for example, hold a combined 15 seats on those three committees, at nine S&P 500 companies, and chaired five of them. (Some serve on other committees as well.) Four also served as lead independent director or independent chairman for one or more companies: Jimenez at P&G and Century Therapeutics, Philip at United Airlines, Reed-Klages at Caterpillar and Boyce at Newmont.""Typically, those leadership positions are based on the experience the other directors value in that director,"" says Knauss, who previously ran Clorox.More is lessThe ranking also docked 15 directors for serving on all three of the key committees, on the grounds that it could blunt a director's effectiveness.That rule bumped Robyn Denholm, Tesla's high-profile board chair, from the top spot, landing her at No. 8 instead. Denholm chairs Tesla's audit committee and sits on its compensation and nominating committees, roles that contributed to criticism by Delaware's Court of Chancery when it found the company cut corners when awarding CEO Elon Musk a pay package that ran to billions of dollars in stock options.A spokesman for Denholm declined to comment.Four directors making the list did so despite receiving less than 80% shareholder support in proxy voting, including Ellen Kullman, lead director at Dell Technologies, with 62.7%, and Carney, who chairs the Grid Dynamics nominating committee, with 72.2%.Most big-company directors win 90% support or better, and analysts often consider anything under 80% as cause for concern. Investors often oppose committee chairs based on fixed voting policies or to make a statement. Some withholding support from Carney flagged that women make up less than 30% of Grid Dynamics' board.Carney notes just two of Grid Dynamics' eight nonemployee directors are white men. He concluded the board didn't need to change as it grappled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then home to nearly half of the company's employees.""We have who we need to make the company successful,"" Carney says. ""My focus is, how do I keep my employees safe, how do I keep the company executing to its true north?""One thing that is difficult to capture in any rankings: personality traits like flexibility, the courage to question decisions and a clear vision of the distinction between the board's role and management.""On paper he or she could have the most stellar background or track record but not really say much, not have much to add — is that value to the company and shareholders?"" says Constantine Alexandrakis, CEO of Russell Reynolds Associates, which places directors and helps boards evaluate their own effectiveness. ""Or are they taking up a seat that could be filled by someone who has a more thoughtful approach?""Ken Denman, No. 14 in the Journal ranking and chair of Costco Wholesale's audit committee and Motorola Solutions' governance and nominating committee, says he looks for intellectual curiosity in potential board members, as well as an understanding of the board's role in asking questions without micromanaging.""At the top level, I think board work is all about being part of an effective team,"" says Denman, who has served as CEO of several tech companies, including one acquired by Apple in 2016.""While the company may have a particular mission, a particular focus, a particular area of expertise — inevitably the world changes,"" Denman says. ""Each person has to know, here's what I can bring to the table.""Theo Francis is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter based in Washington, D.C.

"Tariff crossfire hits Toyota, Nissan, Ford suppliers in Japan",1747967270000,"Four decades ago, Hiroko Suzuki's father threaded the needle of a U.S. trade war by pushing the family auto-parts business into newer niche products. Now, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are so sweeping they threaten her own attempt to diversify the 78-year-old company into medical devices.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has called the U.S. tariffs, including 25% on automobiles, a ""national crisis"" for the world's fourth-largest economy. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, headed to Washington on Friday for a third round of talks.The worry is evident at companies like Kyowa Industrial, a maker of prototype parts and race-car components based in Takasaki, north of Tokyo. Kyowa, which employs 120 people, was among six auto suppliers that told Reuters they were concerned about their ability to withstand the tariff pressure on Japan's car industry.""What in the world are we going to do?"" Suzuki, Kyowa's third-generation president, recalled thinking when the tariffs were announced. ""This is going to be bad."" The problems Kyowa and other auto suppliers face illustrate a decades-long shift in Japan, which no longer floods the world with chips and consumer electronics and is reliant on an auto industry threatened by intense Chinese competition. That marks a contrast with the 1980s, when the U.S. slapped trade barriers on a rising Japan and its then-barnstorming exports.This report, which is based on interviews with a dozen people, including industry executives, bankers and senior government officials, provides a first-hand account of how one firm is grappling with the uncertainty, and details the deepening squeeze on the automotive supply chain at a time of profound disruption.Kyowa and thousands of other small manufacturers comprise an auto-supply network that has for decades pursued a ""monozukuri"" (literally, ""making things"") approach to production. That culture of incremental improvement and assembly-line efficiency, based on methods developed by Toyota, helped make Japan a juggernaut. But the shift to battery-powered smart cars has meant software, in which EV makers such as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and China's BYD SZSE:002594 excel, has become a bigger selling point.Kyowa started developing neurosurgery instruments in 2016 after Suzuki, now 65, realised the rise of EVs would eventually hammer demand for engine components. It began selling the instruments in the U.S. last year, only to find that Trump's tariffs also applied to medical devices.Kyowa doesn't export auto components to the U.S., but Suzuki worries automakers will force suppliers to cut prices to offset tariffs. So far, that hasn't happened to her.One Subaru Corp TSE:7270 supplier said his company may have to start looking for partners expanding outside the U.S. Major automakers have largely offered muted support for suppliers since Trump's tariff announcements. Last month, Toyota TSE:7203 , Nissan TSE:7201 and Ford NYSE:F sent letters to the U.S. arms of some Japanese suppliers asking for cooperation in the face of tariffs, according to copies reviewed by Reuters, without offering specifics.The letters haven't been previously reported.Nissan told suppliers they should stick to previously agreed prices. It said it was ""not obliged"" to bear the costs of tariffs but that it would shoulder some of the hit for up to four weeks to help secure its supply chain. It added that it could later seek to recover any support payments to suppliers.Reuters couldn't determine how much support, if any, Nissan extended. The automakers haven't sent follow-up letters, according to two suppliers, who allowed Reuters to review the correspondence on condition of anonymity.Nissan told Reuters it was working with suppliers to mitigate the tariff impact and contain costs, including through localisation.Toyota said it would seek to protect its suppliers, dealers, and employees while maintaining customers' trust as it navigated the uncertainty created by the tariffs. Ford told Reuters it was working with suppliers to assess their exposure and potentially reconfigure processes and sourcing. In its letter, Toyota said it understood the ""complexity and financial burden some suppliers are facing"" and asked suppliers to identify and share mitigation measures. Toyota would work with suppliers ""in good faith"", it said.Some Toyota suppliers, including Denso TSE:6902 , have not given earnings forecasts for the coming year, citing uncertainty.Julie Boote, an analyst at research firm Pelham Smithers Associates, said the trade war posed an ""emergency"" for Japan's auto industry that would hasten consolidation.""In order to survive, these automakers will have to work together,"" she said. SQUEEZED ON COSTJapanese manufacturers traditionally put pressure on smaller suppliers to lower prices, said Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member who is now a professor at Keio University. If the tariffs remain in place in the longer term, it would spell more damage for regional economies hollowed out by demographic decline, she said.The risks for Japan are already clear. The economy shrank in the first quarter, and Tokyo has compiled emergency economic measures to ease the pain of tariffs.""Automobile exports are just too important to Japan for a 25% tariff to stay in place,"" said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now a director at consulting firm Eurasia Group. Boling said the U.S. is unlikely to go below the 10% it agreed with Britain.Trump introduced a 25% tariff on automobiles and later a 24% tariff on all Japanese goods. The latter was slashed to 10% for 90 days, which runs out in July.Akazawa, the trade envoy, on Tuesday said Japan was sticking to its guns and wanted tariffs eliminated. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations.A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration wanted trading partners to align with U.S. efforts to achieve ""fairness and balance in our trading relationships and protect U.S. economic and national security.""Two senior Japanese officials told Reuters Japan's auto industry was increasingly looking like a laggard and needed to use the tariffs as an opportunity to implement sweeping changes to catch up with EV rivals.In a statement, the trade ministry said that regardless of U.S. tariffs, Japan's auto industry needed to respond to significant changes in the competitive environment.Japan's top auto suppliers, called Tier 1, procure parts from Tier 2 suppliers, and so on down the chain. At the bottom are firms that can be little more than neighbourhood workshops grinding out a single part.Government officials have previously urged smaller companies to innovate and consolidate, to gain scale.At regional lender Ashikaga Bank, an automotive industry team supports some 200 companies, around 80% of which are Tier 2 or lower suppliers. A member of the team not authorised to speak publicly said they worried tariffs would lead to higher vehicle prices and a decline in Japanese car sales in the U.S., hitting the bank's clients.Shinichi Iizuka, president of Toa Kogyo, a suspension maker in Subaru's hometown of Ota, near Takasaki, said the tariff burden will likely be shared by consumers, car dealers, automakers and suppliers. Some 70% of Subaru's car sales are in the U.S., where it relies on both local manufacturing and imports. On Monday, Subaru said it would raise prices on several U.S. models.Subaru CFO Shinsuke Toda this month said it was willing to talk with suppliers about sharing their burden, adding the situation remained unclear.IT'S PERSONALSuzuki's drive to diversify Kyowa Industrial into medical devices mirrors the pivot made by her father during the 1980s trade friction, when Kyowa ditched mass production of less-profitable auto parts to focus on higher-margin prototypes and racing-engine components. Suzuki took over in 2000 and her father died in 2013.Before Trump's tariffs, Suzuki had planned to build a U.S. track record in sales of medical equipment to smooth entry into other markets. With the advent of the U.S. trade barriers, she said her team considered moving production to the U.S., where costs are high, or shifting the sales focus to Asia.Given the uncertainty around Trump's announcements, Kyowa is in talks with potential distributors in Singapore and Hong Kong, Suzuki said.Around 70% of Kyowa's business still comes from automakers, while chip-equipment makers and Japan's space program contribute to the remainder. It supplies most Japanese car makers, General Motors NYSE:GM and parts for Formula One race cars.Annual sales are a modest 2 billion yen ($14 million). Still, Kyowa is larger than three-quarters of the roughly 68,000 companies that make up Japan's auto-supply chain, according to research firm Teikoku Databank. For Suzuki, trade friction is also personal, given her deep affection for the U.S. She grew up listening to rock music on U.S. armed forces radio, learned English and went to university in America. She remembers seeing Aerosmith live at their first concert in Japan.""Japan and America have a long history of friendship. I hope they can find a solution,"" she said.($1 = 145.0700 yen)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0FY:0-tariff-crossfire-hits-toyota-nissan-ford-suppliers-in-japan/"
The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics ,1747763100000,"Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we’ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the “World’s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.”As this trend gains traction, it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we’ll explore four stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), the Global X Robotics & AI ETF (BOTZ) and Tesla (TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolutionGrowth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it’s a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world’s most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla’s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia ,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia’s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank’s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don’t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfd373905094b:0-the-next-major-tech-stock-trend-humanoid-robotics/
Tesla Demand Hasn't Rebounded Yet. Watch China This Week. — Barrons.com,1747585200000,"Al RootInvestors are looking for evidence that brand ""challenges"" caused by Tesla CEO Elon Musk's politics are fading. They're still waiting. A weekly update from China could be a sign this week.Most recent sales data for the electric vehicle maker just hasn't been good, putting second-quarter delivery estimates at risk. Still, there is one caveat: Most of the data is from April, and Musk announced he would step back from some of his government responsibilities at the end of April.The first three months of the year didn't go as planned. Tesla delivered about 337,000 cars in the first quarter, down 13% from a year earlier and far below what Wall Street expected. At the start of 2025, the first-quarter delivery estimate was about 455,000 vehicles, according to FactSet. The miss even had CFO Vaibhav Taneja citing brand image ""challenges"" on his company's first-quarter earnings conference call.Those challenges might have been part of the reason Musk promised on the conference call to spend more time at Tesla than in Washington, D.C.Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was up 47% since the earnings report. An outside observer might assume some sales pickup has contributed to gains. They would be wrong.April sales in key European markets, including France, Germany, and the U.K., fell about 49% from a year ago after dropping about 45% in the first quarter.Tesla's April U.S. sales dropped about 13% after falling 9% in the first quarter. (Tesla's California sales dipped 15% in the first quarter.)April losses accelerated while things were supposed to be getting better with a new version of the Model Y shipping. The model refresh pickup has been slower than expected. Tesla forecaster, who goes by @troyteslike on X and who is widely followed by Wall Street, projects U.S. Model Y production of about 84,000 in the second quarter, up 17% from the first quarter but down about 12% from a year ago.In China, the second quarter started weakly, likely because of U.S.-China trade tensions. Tesla sales in the first six weeks of the second quarter, based on registration data followed by Wall Street, fell about 26% from a year ago. Chinese sales were roughly flat in the first quarter.Investors can look for 13,000 Chinese deliveries from last week when the number becomes available. That would be close to flat from a year ago and a sign that things were normalizing. Below 13,000, and Wall Street will start to reconsider second-quarter estimates.Currently, Wall Street expects about 412,000 cars delivered, up more than 20% from the first quarter but down 7% from last year.What the impact of falling delivery estimates on the stock is hard to say. They haven't impacted the stock lately. The stock market, of course, is forward-looking. Right now, investors are excited about self-driving taxis and robots. (Tesla is planning to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.) Still, growing car sales certainly couldn't hurt the situation.Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 13% year to date, 12 percentage points behind the S&P 500.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

BYD Tops Tesla (TSLA) in European EV Sales for First Time,1747949636000,"BYD overtook Tesla (TSLA, Financials) in European electric vehicle sales for the first time in April, according to JATO Dynamics. BYD logged 7,231 registrations, just ahead of Tesla's 7,165.That's a big shift for the region, where Tesla has long been the dominant EV player. BYD only entered most of Europe in late 2022.Electric vehicle demand across Europe is still growing. BEV sales rose 28% year over year in April, with Chinese automakers leading the charge.Chinese EV brands grew 59% during the month, while Western and Asian rivals saw slower gains at 26%, despite new EU tariffs on Chinese cars.Tesla's numbers have been sliding. The company posted a 13% drop in Q1 deliveries and may see another yearly decline.Elon Musk says sales are bouncing back outside Europe. But analysts point to political protests and factory retooling as drags on demand.Some customers are also waiting for cheaper versions of Tesla's new Model Y, which are still rolling out.Investors should watch for how EU policy, price cuts, and June sales shape the next leg of the EV battle in Europe.Check Tesla insider trades.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e890ff9a1094b:0-byd-tops-tesla-tsla-in-european-ev-sales-for-first-time/
Top Midday Stories: Musk Says He is Committed to Being Tesla CEO for Next 5 Years; Home Depot Maintains Fiscal 2025 Guidance,1747755667000,"All three major US stock indexes were down in late-morning trading Tuesday, similar to Monday as investors processed Moody's recent downgrade of US credit before staging a late rally. In company news, Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg TV that poor sales figures that have plagued the EV-maker this year have ""already turned around."" The CEO said the company ""lost some sales on the left and gained some sales on the right,"" and that the Tesla's stock is ""trading near all-time highs."" Musk also said he is committed to being Tesla's CEO for the next five years. Tesla shares were up 1.2%. Home Depot NYSE:HD reported fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings Tuesday of $3.56 per diluted share, down from $3.67 a year earlier and below FactSet's consensus analyst estimate of $3.60. Fiscal Q1 net sales were $39.86 billion, up from $36.42 billion a year ago and above the FactSet consensus of $39.3 billion. The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 guidance calling for adjusted EPS to decline about 2% from $15.24 a year earlier, with sales growth pegged at about 2.8%. Home Depot shares were up 0.1%. Over 79% of Shell LSE:SHEL shareholders voted against a resolution Tuesday at the company's annual general meeting asking the oil giant to disclose more information about how its forecasts for liquified natural gas demand, production, sales and new projects are consistent with net-zero emissions targets, Bloomberg reported.

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

US Senate to vote this week on bill to bar California 2035 EV plan,1747754111000,"The U.S. Senate plans to vote this week to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 that has been adopted by 11 other states, Majority Leader John Thune said on Tuesday.The U.S. House approved legislation on May 1 to repeal a waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December, allowing California to mandate at least 80% electric vehicles by 2035.Major automakers had urged the action, saying the rules are not feasible. California says the rules are essential to cut pollution and contends the vote is illegal.Thune said the action effectively imposes a stringent nationwide EV mandate because of California's size and other states adopting it. ""Automakers around the country would be forced to close down a significant part of their traditional vehicle production with serious consequences,"" Thune said. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors NYSE:GM Toyota TSE:7203 Volkswagen XETR:VOW Hyundai KRX:005380 and other major automakers has warned car companies could be ""forced to substantially reduce the number of overall vehicles for sale to inflate their proportion of electric vehicle sales."" The California Air Resources Board rules have been adopted by another 11 states, including New York, Massachusetts and Oregon accounting for nearly 40% of the U.S. auto market — but Vermont and Maryland have delayed compliance . The U.S. House separately voted earlier to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks. Democrats say the Senate is violating the rules by moving ahead. In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act, which only requires a majority of the U.S. Senate. California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models. Automakers say it is impossible for them to meet that figure given current EV sales, which are 10% or lower in some states adopting the rules. California says EVs must hit 68% of new vehicle sales by 2030. The U.S. Transportation Department is separately moving to undo aggressive fuel economy rules adopted by Biden and plans to declare that the Biden administration exceeded its authority in considering EVs when writing the rules.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RS0LJ:0-us-senate-to-vote-this-week-on-bill-to-bar-california-2035-ev-plan/"

Tesla's Emissions Credits Are at Risk After Senate's California Vote — Barrons.com,1747946340000,"Al RootCongress took another step to erode California's ability to regulate emissions affecting air quality, dealing a potentially significantly blow to Tesla's ability to profit from sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission vehicles.California has long had a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency that allowed it to regulate its own air quality. But on Thursday morning, the Senate voted to essentially eliminate that, using the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies.The California Air Resources Board, which sets emission policy for the state, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Democratic lawmakers warned that set a bad precedent for upending agency decisions. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Ron Wyden (D., Ore), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways.""That means Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.The vote is just one twist in a continuing fight over California emissions. California has successfully fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past, and it has support in the current battle.""Today, in an unprecedented and illegal attack on the nation's bedrock air quality law, the United States Senate passed Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions to block states from implementing policies to reduce cancer-causing pollution from motor vehicles,"" said CALSTART, a nonprofit advancing clean transportation technologies, in an emailed statement. ""Authorization for these policies has been a core component of the Clean Air Act for more than 50 years.""Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify a so-called waiver of preemption permitting California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations that the EPA had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that follow California's standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That is a tall order because EVs account for about 20% of California's new car sales today. They are only about 7% to 8% nationwide.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which includes General Motors and Ford Motor, supports rolling back the 2030 requirement.The California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's sales of zero-emission vehicle credits, which it receives because its all-electric fleet allows it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to auto makers that haven't met the targets have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California news. Tesla stock was up 3.6% in late Thursday trading, despite the vote, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.4%.One explanation for the move is that investors are increasingly viewing Tesla as an artificial-intelligence company than a car manufacturer. Investors are focusing on the company's plans to launch a robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June — an enterprise that depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to fully overturning the California system.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla's China Sales Stink. The Stock Is Rising Because of Musk. — Barrons.com,1747753320000,"Al RootTesla stock jumped early Tuesday despite more weak sales data. Comments from CEO Elon Musk might be helping.Shares have been on a tear since the company reported first-quarter earnings, leading to a stretched valuation for even a hot growth stock.Tesla shares added 1.1% to $345.86 in early trading, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%.Musk said at a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, according to Bloomberg. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The statement isn't a big surprise for investors, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He has some work to do at Tesla. Tuesday's stock gains come despite Tesla selling 11,150 cars in China this past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung. That is a big improvement from the 3,040 sold the week before, but results are still down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Investors have been looking for a recovery in Tesla's sales after the number of vehicles delivered dipped 13% in the first quarter from a year ago. It hasn't gotten there yet. In the first seven weeks of the second quarter, Tesla sold about 48,000 vehicles in China, down 24% from the comparable time a year ago.Despite the weak sales, coming into Tuesday trading, Tesla stock was up about 44% since the company reported its first-quarter earnings on April 22. That left shares trading for about 172 times estimated 2025 earnings, up from closer to 72 times a year ago.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas sees the valuation getting even higher before it gets better, although that doesn't mean he believes the stock is going down.The valuation-multiple expansion is hard for value-oriented investors to understand. A year ago, Tesla shares were roughly $200 and Wall Street projected 2025 earnings roughly $3. Now, shares are north of $340, and Wall Street's 2025 EPS estimate is below $2.The stock has risen while estimates have fallen. ""Nearly 15 years after going public, investors struggle to justify the value of Tesla as much as ever before,"" wrote Jonas on Monday, adding he sees the valuation problem getting ""worse before it gets better.""The problem is the future. Tesla is investing heavily in AI and robotics, and those businesses don't generate substantial earnings yet. ""The majority of the company's current $1.1 trillion market [value] is based on businesses that have either poor disclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all,"" added Jonas.He rates Tesla shares Buy and has a $410 price target for the stock, valuing the company at roughly $1.3 trillion. Only $240 billion, or $75 a share, of the valuation comes from the car business.The majority of his value comes from AI-related businesses such as self-driving cars. He doesn't have the robot business in his model, which could easily be worth $100 a share, by his math.

Funds: How Fund Managers Are Grappling With 'Autocracy Risk' — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Lewis BrahamThe reason Yves Choueifaty avoids Chinese stocks isn't that there's a trade war. It's that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has virtually unlimited power. To the chief investment officer of Paris-based asset manager Tobam, autocracy itself is China's crucial risk factor.Tobam designed the Tobam Lbrty All World Equity Index, which is tracked by the Westwood Lbrty Global Equity exchange-traded fund. Launched in March, the ETF excludes stocks of autocratic countries such as China, Russia, Turkey, and Thailand — not on ethical grounds, but investment ones.""There is no sustainable [economic] prosperity without solid democratic institutions,"" Choueifaty says. He points to research conducted by Nobel Prize--winning economist Daron Acemoglu indicating that the economic growth of autocracies lags behind democracies.Other fund managers don't exclude autocracies but incorporate what one could call an ""autocracy risk factor"" into their stock analysis. ""We're a growth strategy,"" says David Eiswert, manager of the top-performing T. Rowe Price Global Stock fund. ""What we say is we want to be on 'the right side of change.' That's how we think about normal markets, where the rules are fair. But then in China, we basically developed a strategy where we said we need to be on the right side of Xi. It's not about change; it's about understanding policy, understanding the companies that are favored. That's a really hard game."" The fund currently has just a 3% China stock weighting.The rules are never fair for citizens or businesses in autocracies because the dictator is above the law and there are no checks and balances from other branches of government. That creates an environment in which corruption and bribery are necessary to gain access to the ruler and either win his favor or avoid his wrath. It also means that economic policies are uncertain and can shift overnight based on the autocrat's whims. Such uncertainty increases market volatility and reduces the equity valuations investors should be willing to pay.""A lot of times when autocrats are in a democracy and begin to take control, the first thing they do is try to appease the oligarchs,"" Eiswert says. ""That happened in Nazi Germany, in Turkey, and in Russia. [The autocrat says:] 'You get to run the steel mills. You get to run the energy [industry]. Of course, I'm going to take my cut, but you're going to get rewarded.' ""At first, the stock prices of those companies go up. But eventually, Eiswert says, investors recognize ""'this market is no longer allocating capital in a way we understand.' And then you get compression of [stock valuation] multiples.""Eiswert has begun to see that pattern in the U.S. under President Donald Trump. ""An analogy would be Tesla, when [Elon] Musk backed Trump, and then Trump won,"" he says. ""Tesla's [stock] fundamentals were quite weak, but the stock price in the back half of 2024 went straight up. So the market was initially telling you, 'Oh, we get this. This guy's got an unfair advantage right now.' So the first stage is reward the oligarchs. The leader picks the winners."" But the next stage is those stocks fall — which Tesla, down 17% this year, has done.Analyzing autocracy risk means seeing tariffs only as symptoms of a larger problem. This is an important distinction because the market tends to rally whenever Trump pauses the tariffs. But it's the unchecked power he now has in the executive branch to impose them without congressional approval, which tariffs needed in the past, that is the real risk, as it creates uncertainty.This concentration of executive power grew before even Trump's current term. One could see an early autocracy risk signal in the July 2024 Supreme Court ruling extending absolute immunity to prosecution for presidential acts, essentially rendering any president — Republican or Democrat — above the law. Such presidential power has only expanded as Trump has dismantled formerly independent regulatory agencies, challenged basic Constitutional rights like due process, and cut deals with oligarchs seeking his favor.Eiswert sees the latest tariff-off rallies as short term. ""I think the market is pretty sure we're not on an upward sloping line,"" he says. So, what should investors do? Stick with U.S. stock funds that invest in high-quality but reasonably valued large companies that can perform well in difficult environments. (Small companies don't have the same political clout as large ones.) Or consider a global fund that can reduce or increase its U.S. exposure as the manager sees fit. Eiswert has cut his U.S. weighting from 67.5% a year ago to 58.0% as of April 30.Even the strictest autocracies, like China, often have investment opportunities. This is where active management can pay off. ""We do come to binary conclusions, but we do it stock by stock, not country by country,"" says manager Andrew Foster of the top-performing Seafarer Overseas Growth and Income fund. ""If I went around and said I'm going to not invest in certain countries in the emerging markets because of their politics, I don't think I'd invest in a single one ever. I'd be disappointed in the current politics of each."" Instead, he looks for high-quality stocks that are least exposed to autocratic control.It would be foolish to exclude the U.S. entirely, as it's still far from being like China and Russia. ""There is a recession of democracy across the world, including in the U.S.,"" Choueifaty says. ""But for the time being, the United States is in a much better situation. Opponents are not killed. Journalists are not killed.""Barring an extreme turn of events, it's likely to remain that way.Email: editors@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250514001121:0/

"Trump's $4 Trillion Tax Shock: EV Credits Slashed, Rich Rewarded, Markets Rattled",1747932769000,"President Trump's flagship tax bill just scraped through the House in a nail-biting 215214 vote. Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the package delivers fresh tax breaks for high earners and legacy industrieswhile blowing a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase amid ballooning deficit concerns. Trump called it the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed, but markets are already calculating the long-term cost. The bill now moves to the Senate, where even GOP lawmakers are signaling major revisions ahead.Bond markets may be the first to flinch. Moody's NYSE:MCO already warned of rising debt risksand this bill could pour fuel on that fire. It extends Trump-era tax cuts, raises the SALT cap to $40,000, and adds military and immigration spending increases. At the same time, it phases out EV tax creditsincluding for Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA by 2025. In their place? A deduction for auto loan interest on U.S.-built gas vehicles. Freedom Caucus members also secured cuts to clean energy subsidies and accelerated work requirements for Medicaid, all timed just ahead of the midterms.Investors are now watching the Senate closely. Some Republicans want to make corporate tax cuts permanent. Others are pushing back on healthcare reductions and demanding deeper spending cuts. The final version could still swing dramatically.

"S&P 500 Climbs on Week, Led by Technology, Consumer Discretionary",1747428317000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.3% this week in a broad climb that pushed the market benchmark back into positive territory for the year. The market benchmark ended Friday's session at 5,958.38 and is now up 7% for the month and 1.3% for 2025. The week started with a relief rally as the Trump administration unveiled a trade deal with China just days after announcing another such deal with the UK. The deal between the US and China calls for a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties on each other's goods. The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. On Friday, Trump said the US will unilaterally set tariffs for many other countries soon. ""We will be telling people what they will be paying to do business in the United States,"" he said. Still, stocks held on to the week's gains, especially in the technology sector, as a number of corporate deals were signed amid Trump's Middle East tour. All of the S&P 500's sectors posted weekly gains. Technology rose 8.1%, followed by a 7.7% gain in consumer discretionary, a 6.6% rise in communication services and a 5.5% increase in industrials. Energy and financials rose more than 3% each, followed by smaller gains in other sectors. Super Micro Computer NASDAQ:SMCI had the largest percentage increase in the technology sector, surging 44% as the company said it signed a memorandum of understanding with DataVolt to develop hyperscale AI campuses in Saudi Arabia. The agreement depends on finalizing one or more binding contracts, with the minimum market value of the planned products estimated at $20 billion, it said. First Solar NASDAQ:FSLR was also strong, soaring 27% amid a number of positive analyst actions including a rating upgrade from Wolfe Research. First Solar may benefit from a ""favorable"" US utility-scale solar tax policy, as only ""relatively minor changes"" were proposed in the Republican budget, UBS said in a note to clients while raising its price target on the stock. The consumer discretionary sector was boosted by a 17% jump in Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA shares. Following the trade deal between the US and China, the electric vehicle maker intends to ship components to the US from China for Cybercab and Semi trucks by the end of May, according to a Reuters report. In communication services, Fox's NASDAQ:FOX shares climbed 12% as the media company reported a surprise increase in its fiscal third-quarter earnings. The company's quarterly revenue topped market estimates as the Super Bowl LIX drove sharp gains in its advertising sales. Health care was the weakest sector, eking out a gain of just 0.3%. UnitedHealth Group NYSE:UNH had the largest percentage drop in the sector, falling 23% as a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the matter said the company is facing a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice over possible Medicare fraud tied to its Medicare Advantage operations.

US Senate votes to block California 2035 electric vehicle rules,1747929849000,"The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 that has been adopted by 11 other states representing a third of the U.S. auto market.The vote sends to President Donald Trump the measure to repeal a waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December, allowing California to mandate at least 80% of vehicles be electric vehicles by 2035. The vote is a win for General Motors NYSE:GM , Toyota TSE:7203 and other automakers that heavily lobbied against the rules and a blow to California and environmental groups that say the requirements are essential to ensuring cleaner vehicles and cutting pollution.California first announced a plan in 2020 to require that by 2035 at least 80% of new cars sold be electric and up to 20% plug-in hybrid models.""This Senate vote is illegal,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said, adding the Senate action would cost California taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in additional health care costs. ""We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.""Since 1970, California has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act.Senate Republicans rejected the advice of the parliamentarian in moving forward.

""In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla.""Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen denounced the vote. ""While our Republican leaders may try to put the horse back in the barn when it comes to electric vehicles, the world has already shifted under their feet,"" she said. Tesla did not immediately comment. GM praised the vote, saying it would ""align emissions standards with today’s market realities.""The Senate separately voted Thursday to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks and to bar California's low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines.These are the latest actions in recent months taking aim at electric vehicles.A separate bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday would end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. It would also phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028.If upheld by the courts, rescinding California's rules will make it easier for automakers to delay or cancel some EV production. Automakers had warned in the coming months they might have been forced to limit gas-powered vehicles in some states.California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models. Automakers say it is impossible for them to meet that figure given current EV sales, which are 10% or lower in some states adopting the rules.

Update: CATL Goes Public in Hong Kong. The Tesla Battery Supplier Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs. — Barrons.com,1747749120000,"Al RootShares of electric-vehicle-battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at HKD$263 apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750."" The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It's stepping on the gas while Honda is hitting the break.Tuesday, Honda announced plans to ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend 10 trillion Yen, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by 3 trillion Yen, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda's U.S.-listed American Depository Receipts were up 0.8% in early trading, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach while also pleased the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It's also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The latter is due to start in Austin, Texas, in June.Easing trade tensions between China and the U.S., which boosted most shares, also helped, pointed out Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster in a recent tweet.""Ride-hailing is a massive opportunity,"" he wrote. ""This year in the U.S., Uber and Lyft are expected to generate about $90 billion in gross bookings across roughly four billion rides ... Tesla is projected to generate approximately $100 billion in total revenue this year. In other words, ride-hailing could materially move the needle.""That's what investors are betting on.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

China's BYD Outsells Tesla in Europe for First Time,1747924980000,"By Mauro OrruChinese auto giant BYD sold more electric vehicles in Europe than Tesla for the first time, a setback for Elon Musk's EV maker as it faces growing competition overseas.Tesla registered 7,165 battery-electric vehicles in Europe last month, down 49% on year according to data from Jato Dynamics, a consumer research group. In contrast, registrations for BYD more than doubled to 7,231 vehicles.""Although the difference between the two brands' monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,"" said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics. ""This is a watershed moment for Europe's car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.""Tesla sales in Europe have been languishing for months as the company grapples with stiff competition and backlash from Chief Executive Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. New car registrations for Tesla models in the European Union slumped 36% in March, 47% in February and 50% in January, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an industry body.The company in April posted a 71% fall in net income for the first quarter. Musk said at the time that he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla as investors were concerned that he had taken his eye off the ball.Meanwhile, BYD has been expanding rapidly in Europe even as the EU raised tariffs on China-made EVs. BYD's registrations, including plug-in hybrids, more than quadrupled in April from a year earlier, according to Jato Dynamics data. The research group attributed that growth to a broad and competitive lineup of fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.BYD in April reported a doubling in net profit for the first quarter. The company sold more battery EVs than Tesla in the first three months of the year, retaining the crown as the world's top EV seller.Jato Dynamics said BYD's rapid expansion in Europe had already pushed the Chinese company ahead of legacy brands, outselling Fiat and Seat in France.Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522007140:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time/

Kraken launches tokens to offer 24/7 trading of U.S. equities,1747923186000,"Crypto exchange Kraken said on Thursday it is launching tokens of U.S. equities that will trade around the clock, giving non-U.S. investors exposure to high-profile companies such as Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA .Tokenization refers to the process of issuing digital representations of publicly-traded securities. Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities.The tokens' launch outside the U.S. comes amid growing interest in blending traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. While tokenized securities have yet to gain widespread adoption, proponents say they hold the potential to significantly reshape how people access and invest in financial markets.In a January opinion piece for the Washington Post, Robinhood NASDAQ:HOOD CEO Vlad Tenev said tokenization could also allow retail investors to access private companies' stocks. Kraken's tokens, called xStocks, will be available in select markets outside the United States, it said, without naming the markets.

"Nvidia seeks Shanghai R&D site after US chip curbs, say sources",1747407998000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA is seeking a site in Shanghai for a research and development centre, three sources close to the matter said, reflecting the strategic significance of the Chinese market where U.S. curbs on advanced chip exports have hit sales.The U.S. chipmaker began the search in early 2025 and is primarily evaluating locations in Shanghai's Minhang and Xuhui districts, one of the sources said. The project gained momentum after a surprise visit to China by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month, said two of the sources.Huang, who has consistently said China is critical to Nvidia's growth, made his visit immediately after the U.S. placed new restrictions on China-bound shipments of its H20 chips, the only AI chip the company can sell legally in China.Huang met senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier He Lifeng and Shanghai's mayor Gong Zheng.Reuters reported earlier this month that Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of the H20 chip for China in the next two months, as it seeks to prop up sales in the country, where it has been lost market share to domestic rivals such as Huawei. ""We are not sending any GPU (graphics processor unit) designs to China to be modified to comply with export controls,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company is leasing a new space for existing employees in China, but no core intellectual property or GPU designs are being sent to that facility or any others in the country, the spokesperson added. When asked by reporters in Taipei on Friday if the report about its plan to set up a research center in Shanghai was true, Huang said: ""We already have a research center in Shanghai. We have 2,000 people in Pudong. Nvidia has been in China for 30 years.""Nvidia currently has offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to its website. China generated $17 billion in revenue for Nvidia in the fiscal year ending January 26, accounting for 13% of the company's total sales. The local government of Shanghai, which hosts China's largest foreign business community, including firms such as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , has expressed willingness to offer incentives for the Nvidia project, including tax reductions, said two of the sources.The local authorities are also considering offering a substantial amount of land to Nvidia for its China R&D centre, one source added. The Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources declined to be named, as the plan is not public.Following his visit to China, Huang told CNBC that the country's AI market could reach approximately $50 billion within the next two-to-three years. He said that being excluded from this rapidly expanding sector would represent a ""tremendous loss"" for Nvidia, especially as competition with Huawei intensifies.During an earnings call in February, before H20 chip sales to China were restricted, Nvidia executives said the company's sales to China were about half the level before U.S. export controls.Since 2022, the U.S. government has imposed restrictions on the export of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China, citing concerns over potential military applications. The Financial Times first reported on Friday about Nvidia's plan to build a R&D centre in China.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RO137:0-nvidia-seeks-shanghai-r-d-site-after-us-chip-curbs-say-sources/"

GM's New LMR Battery Could Change the Game: Is it Ready to Lead?,1747399860000,"General Motors GM is setting the stage for a big leap in EV battery innovation. The company just revealed plans for a new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery technology that could dramatically lower costs and boost the performance of its largest electric vehicles (EVs). If all goes according to plan, GM could become the first automaker to bring LMR prismatic battery cells to market — a move targeted for 2028.These new batteries are designed for GM’s full-size electric trucks and SUVs like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR chemistry swaps out pricey materials like nickel and cobalt for more common and affordable manganese. This shift not only cuts raw material costs but could also help GM improve the range and weight efficiency of its EVs.GM claims that LMR batteries offer 33% higher energy density than today’s top lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, all while maintaining comparable costs. This means more miles per charge without driving up sticker prices.Production is already on the horizon. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution, aims to begin preproduction in late 2027 and full commercial production in 2028. It’s all part of GM’s broader push to scale its Ultium platform and improve EV profitability.But GM isn’t the only auto giant chasing this battery breakthrough. Ford F is also in the race, and it's moving fast. Last month, the company announced that it is developing its own LMR battery chemistry at its Ion Park R&D center in Michigan. Ford has already begun pilot production of second-generation cells and aims to roll out LMR-powered EVs before the decade ends.Ford sees LMR as the “what’s next” solution following its current use of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and LFP batteries. The company believes the chemistry could unlock longer-range, lower-cost EVs, especially crucial for scaling up mass-market adoption.Tesla TSLA, meanwhile, planted early seeds in this space. CEO Elon Musk floated the idea of high-manganese batteries as far back as 2020 during Tesla’s “Battery Day.” At the time, he said Tesla aimed to create cathodes with one-third manganese content to stretch its nickel supply further. Tesla holds patents related to LMR chemistry, but it is yet to share firm production plans.GM looks set to be the first to market with LMR batteries, Ford is close behind, while Tesla's earlier concepts still await a clear update.The Zacks Rundown for General MotorsShares of General Motors have lost around 6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 13%. From a valuation standpoint, GM trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 5.28, significantly below the industry. It carries a Value Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2025 sales and EPS implies a 6% and 12% decline, respectively, year on year. Estimates have been southbound over the past 30 days for the current and next quarter, as well as for 2025 and 2026.GM stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:b6722f056094b:0-gm-s-new-lmr-battery-could-change-the-game-is-it-ready-to-lead/

Wall Street Loves China's Battery Beast--Even the Pentagon Can't Stop It,1747743395000,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd (CATL) just pulled off the biggest listing of the yearand did it with style. The Chinese battery leader's shares jumped 16% in their Hong Kong debut after raising $4.6 billion, a number that could climb to $5.3 billion with full allotment. The offering attracted massive interest from both institutional and retail investors, despite CATL being blacklisted by the Pentagon earlier this yeara move the company continues to deny relevance to. The stock opened at HK$263 and closed well above that, even trading higher than its Shenzhen counterparta rare feat for dual-listed Chinese names.CATL, the dominant force behind 38% of the global EV battery market, supplies Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , Volkswagen, Ford, and others. It's also stepping on the gas with new tech: batteries that can deliver over 500km of range in just five minutes of charging and up to 1,500km fully charged. That kind of leap, combined with a forward earnings multiple around 17x, has some analysts seeing upside potential of up to 50%. Jefferies' Johnson Wan noted the setup was a no-brainer buy, citing solid fundamentals, global tailwinds, and a fresh $7.6 billion earmarked for overseas expansionespecially into Europe, where margins are wider and demand is climbing.Options trading volume on day one topped 34,000 contracts, the highest in a decade for Hong Kong IPOs with listed options, and sentiment leaned heavily bullish. Backed by big names like Qatar Investment Authority and Hillhouse, CATL's listing could help revive Hong Kong's IPO scene, lifting total issuance above $22 billion for the year. JPMorgan and Bank of America, despite political pushback from a U.S. congressional committee, stayed on the dealsignaling confidence in CATL's growth story. Chairman Robin Zeng called the listing a milestone in its push for a zero-carbon future, while the broader market seems to agree: investors want in, and they're willing to look past the noise to bet on the next leg of the global EV race.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:36a2c0669094b:0-wall-street-loves-china-s-battery-beast-even-the-pentagon-can-t-stop-it/

General Motors Urges Lawmakers to Block EV Mandate as EV Demand Slows,1747743240000,"General Motors Company GM is urging lawmakers to block California’s strict zero-emission vehicle mandate, signaling a significant reversal in the automaker’s stance as demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States begins to slow, per the Wall Street Journal.Per an internal email sent by GM to thousands of salaried employees last week, emissions regulations that are not aligned with market conditions threaten the company’s business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable.Once a supporter of California’s plan to phase out gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035, GM is now lobbying against it. The company is encouraging employees to contact Senators to revoke California’s waiver, which permits the state to enforce stricter emissions rules. These rules have been adopted by 11 other states. GM had previously aligned its EV strategy with California's goals, but declining EV demand and market pressures have prompted a strategic shift. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .California aims for 35% of all new vehicle sales to be electric or plug-in hybrid (PHEV) by 2026. However, in the first quarter, EVs accounted for 20.8% of sales and PHEVs 3.7%, totaling 24.5%, which is roughly 10 percentage points below the target and slightly down from the previous quarter.As EV sales fall short of projections, major automakers like GM and Ford Motor Company F are scaling back their EV initiatives. GM has abandoned its plan to produce 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and postponed several key launches as consumers prefer more affordable options and federal tax incentives face potential rollbacks.In the first four months of 2025, Ford’s EV sales declined 2.9% year over year to 27,409 units. Also, the company's Model e segment, which features all-electric models, continues to struggle amid stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024, exacerbated by ongoing pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. The company is expected to incur huge losses in its EV business this year as well. Another auto giant, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, is also struggling with falling demand for EVs. In the first quarter, Tesla deliveries fell 13% year over year to 336,681 units. Automotive margins are also on the decline amid falling volumes and generous discount offers. The metric came in at 11.3% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 15.5% reported in the corresponding quarter of 2024. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c8c334c74094b:0-general-motors-urges-lawmakers-to-block-ev-mandate-as-ev-demand-slows/

Tesla Stock Drops. The 'Big Beautiful Bill' Is Big Trouble and There's Another Vote to Watch. — Barrons.com,1747917900000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling in early trading Thursday after the House of Representatives passed its tax-and-spend bill. And its not the only vote that matters Thursday.Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were off 1.9% at $328.39, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.The House passed its budget bill on Thursday, and it included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay $250 and $100 annual fees, respectively. It also terminated credits on most clean energy initiatives, including those for new and used electric vehicles. None of that is good Tesla.But there is another vote coming Thursday, this one in the Senate, which is voting on a Congressional Review Act measure Thursday designed to essentially eliminate a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency that lets California regulate its air emissions.The CRA can be used to overturn federal agency actions.It's a controversial step. For starters, California has been regulating its air quality since the late 1960s. And Republicans have maneuvered around Senate filibuster rules. Democrats aren't happy with the strategy. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways."" Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.However the vote turns out, it appears to be just one step in a lengthy fight over California emissions. California has fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past.The Senate vote isn't the first salvo from the Republican-controlled Congress. Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify the "" waiver of preemption"" for California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations, which the Environmental Protection Agency had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that have adopted California standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of California's new car sales today. EVs are only about 7% to 8% of nationwide new car sales.Changes could be a problem for Tesla because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California air quality news. Coming into Thursday trading, shares were up almost 19% in May.One explanation for the move is AI. Investors are thinking more about the company's plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. The success of that business depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to overturn the California system fully.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"High-Yield ETFs: Big Payouts, Bigger Trade-Offs?",1747743240000,"While a significant amount of money continues to flow into low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs, the ETF universe is becoming increasingly complex. Most new ETFs being launched are actively managed, and many make use of derivatives.Two recent regulatory changes—the “ETF Rule” and the “Derivatives Rule”—have made it easier for providers to launch ETFs and incorporate derivatives into their strategies. The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking.Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:Buffer or defined outcome ETFsLeveraged or inverse single-stock ETFsOption-based income ETFsSome of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs. (See: Buffer ETFs Attract Billions as Investors Seek Shelter from Market Turmoil)This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts.We analyzed the performance of 24 single-stock covered call ETFs in the YieldMax suite from their respective inception dates. We focused on YieldMax because it is the clear leader in this niche, significantly ahead of competitors despite a recent surge in similar offerings.Many of YieldMax’s ETFs launched in 2023—providing a limited, yet more substantial, performance history compared to most rivals, which are even newer.Despite their eye-popping distribution rates, these products tend to underperform on a total return basis due to steep declines in share price. Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, only two managed to slightly outperform their respective underlying stocks.Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy WorksYieldMax currently offers 48 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of over $10 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market.According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap.These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income.To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spread strategies to further enhance yields.The YieldMax Reddit community has around 44,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income.The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums—and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM.Yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly payout and dividing it by the fund’s latest NAV. However, yields can vary significantly from month to month as income from selling options depends on fluctuations in the underlying stock, implied volatility, and other factors.Performance Since InceptionWe analyzed the total return—including distributions—of 24 YieldMax single-stock ETFs from their inception versus their respective underlying stocks. Some stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat—but in all cases except those tracking PayPal PYPL and Marathon Digital MARA, the ETF underperformed the stock.For the four most popular products, the performance gap was substantial—showing that investors may be leaving a lot of money on the table in pursuit of yield.YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY )The most popular product in the suite celebrated its one-year anniversary in February and now boasts $4 billion in assets. It is also the highest-yielding single-stock ETF in the lineup, offering a distribution rate of 136%. Since inception, it has delivered a total return of 286%, while MSTR stock has surged 457% during the same period.Once a little-known, money-losing software firm, Strategy MSTR has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and now trades like a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. Its stock commands a significant premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings.Some experts believe the financial engineering behind MSTY—and the premium valuation—may be unsustainable. If you're bullish on bitcoin, why not consider the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which charges just 0.25% and closely tracks the price of the asset?TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY)The oldest product in the suite holds $1.2 billion in assets. Since its debut in November 2022, the ETF has gained approximately 22%—significantly underperforming Tesla TSLA shares, which are up about 102% over the same period. It has also lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, which have gained 53% and 85%, respectively.For context, low-cost index funds like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM charge just 0.02% and 0.15% in fees, while most option income products charge close to 1%. TSLY currently boasts a striking yield of nearly 107%.NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY )The second most popular product in the family has generated a total return of about 187% since its inception in May 2023. However, shares of the AI darling NVIDIA NVDA have risen approximately 372% over the same period. Still, the ETF has attracted $1.3 billion in assets.YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY )CONY, which tracks Coinbase COIN—a major beneficiary of bitcoin’s rise—has returned 120% since its debut in August 2023. Over the same period, COIN stock has gained about 209%. The ETF currently sports a yield of 97% and has about $1.1 billion in assets.Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFsThese ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price. In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if the stock falls—creating an asymmetric risk-reward profile.By contrast, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI—which helped launch the covered call trend—uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of about 125 stocks. (Read: What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?)The fund then sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate monthly income. This portfolio doesn’t experience the outsized moves seen in names like Strategy or Coinbase, which explains why the performance shortfall may not be too striking.Bottom LineYou should only invest in a fund tied to a single stock if you're bullish on that specific name—in which case, you're generally better off owning the stock directly. If you expect the stock to decline, it’s best to steer clear of any product linked to it.These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound. However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don’t expect jumbo distributions.If you’re drawn to high monthly income and can accept an asymmetric risk-reward profile—as well as potentially unfavorable and inconsistent tax treatment—these funds may still appeal to you.ETFs have democratized access to markets, and innovation in the space has been remarkable. But with complex products like these, it’s essential for investors to fully understand how they work—and what outcomes are realistic.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ab88debad094b:0-high-yield-etfs-big-payouts-bigger-trade-offs/

BEV registrations surged 28% in April from last year, largely driven by Chinese car brands.Despite the EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, registrations of such cars increased 59% in the month from a year earlier, while carmakers from Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States recorded 26% growth. WEAK TESLA DEMANDThe company reported its first drop in annual deliveries last year, and analysts expect another fall this year after a 13% decline in the first quarter.Musk said earlier this week that Tesla had already turned around sales, and demand was strong in regions apart from Europe. His political views have triggered waves of protests against Tesla in the U.S. and Europe, leading to a slump in sales.Additionally, production halts to retool factories to make the redesigned Model Y crossover globally caused a drop in manufacturing and sales in the first quarter.Analysts have also attributed lower sales to customers waiting for less-expensive versions of the new Model Y, Tesla's best-selling vehicle, to become more widely available.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU0QZ:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time-report-says/"

Tesla Sets Record With $139 Million Pay Package for Finance Chief — WSJ,1747733400000,"By Theo FrancisElon Musk isn't the only Tesla executive rewriting the compensation playbook. The electric carmaker's finance chief, Vaibhav Taneja, received a pay package of $139 million last year.That's more than most CEOs and the highest amount paid to a chief financial officer since modern reporting began in 2006, according to Equilar. It eclipses the $86 million package that hydrogen-truck maker Nikola gave its then-CFO in 2020. Nikola filed for bankruptcy this year.Taneja's compensation was tied to stock options and equity awards he received in October 2024 that recognized his promotion to CFO in August 2023. The 47-year-old has held other financial roles at Tesla since 2017.Taneja's boss, meanwhile, is still working without a paycheck. Tesla's board has formed a special committee to review Musk's compensation. His pay has been tied up in legal fights since a multibillion stock grant was thrown out by a court. Tesla has appealed that decision.Tesla's shares were trading near $250 at the time of Taneja's equity award, which vests — or becomes fully Taneja's property to sell or exercise — over four years. They closed around $342 on Monday.The award came during a period of mixed results for Tesla. While the stock soared toward the end of the year following the election of President Trump, global vehicle deliveries fell for the first time in more than a decade.

EV Owners Face Annual Fee Under Proposed Tax Bill — Barrons.com,1747868640000,"Al RootThe latest version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill includes another hit to the electric vehicle industry.The legislation includes a provision for the Federal Highway Administration to impose a $250 annual fee on all-electric vehicles and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.The FHA helps build and maintain roads — and gets most of its money from gasoline taxes. With all-electric cars using no gas, EV drivers get (small) free lunch paid for by drivers of gas-guzzling vehicles.The free lunch might be less than drivers of gasoline-powered cars would guess, though. Already, 37 states collect annual EV fees ranging from $50 to $250 a year. The average is about $142, according to Atlas Public Policy. Some other states collect fees at public charging stations.As for traditional cars, the amount an average driver might contribute to the FHA's Highway Trust Fund is probably about $100 annually. The new law might seem a little punitive toward EVs, but EVs are a little heavier than gasoline-powered vehicles. More weight can equal more wear and tear on the roads.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents many auto makers in Washington, including General Motors and Ford Motor, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which isn't a part of the AAI, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The latest version of the bill also ends the $7,500 purchase tax credit for qualifying electric vehicles.And earlier this month, the House voted to strip California's ability to regulate its air quality. The House resolution would need Senate approval and the president's signature to become law.That legislation could be a problem because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.California is currently requiring that roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of new car sales today. The AAI supports a slackening of California EV regulation.Electric vehicles appear to be losing policy support on multiple fronts. The annual highway levy is likely the least of the industry's concerns.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

US Defense Secretary Hegseth meets Musk for second time at Pentagon,1747866002000,"U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met billionaire Elon Musk at the Pentagon on Wednesday, officials said, the second known time the close ally of President Donald Trump has visited the department's headquarters. In March, Musk, whose businesses have a number of Defense Department contracts, was granted an unprecedented top-level meeting at the Pentagon. ""The Secretary met with Elon Musk and other members of the X AI team this morning,"" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. ""The Department of Defense is committed to engaging with AI industry CEOs to ensure our warfighters are equipped to face 21st century threats,"" Parnell added. The meeting was first reported by Reuters.Earlier on Wednesday, Hegseth's pastor, Brooks Potteiger, had said on X: ""It's not everyday you walk past Elon Musk en route to preach."" Potteiger spoke at a Christian prayer service at the Pentagon on Wednesday.Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ahead of his first meeting in March, there was a media report that Musk would be briefed on secret war plans for China, something Musk, Trump and others denied. Musk, at the time, called the report ""pure propaganda"" and urged legal action against leakers. Musk's businesses Starlink and SpaceX already have a number of Pentagon contracts, raising questions about conflicts of interest as he advocates for innovation and re-prioritization of Pentagon spending to find efficiencies. Trump's planned Golden Dome missile defense shield, which would require hundreds of sensors and other satellites to keep watch for incoming ballistic missiles, would be a natural fit for SpaceX and its Starlink unit. The opportunities for his companies, SpaceX in particular, under Trump could drive billions of dollars of revenue to his firms. The White House has previously said Musk will recuse himself if any conflicts of interest arise between his business dealings and his role in cutting federal government spending. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has made cuts across the U.S. government, including at the Pentagon.Musk said on Tuesday he will cut his political spending substantially, the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT115:0-us-defense-secretary-hegseth-meets-musk-for-second-time-at-pentagon/"

US expected to declare Biden fuel economy rules exceeded legal authority,1747698772000,"The U.S. Transportation Department is expected to declare that fuel economy rules issued under then President Joe Biden exceeded the government's legal authority by including electric vehicles in setting the rules, automaker officials said Monday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday submitted its interpretive rule, ""Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program"" to the White House for review.The prior administration had ""illegally used CAFE standards as a backdoor electric vehicle mandate – driving the price of cars up,"" he said in a statement.Removing EVs from the calculations for credits and the regulatory mandates could result in lower overall fuel economy requirements.NHTSA in June said it would hike CAFE requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 liters per 100 km) by 2031 from 39.1 mpg currently for light-duty vehicles.Last year, 120 Republican lawmakers said NHTSA exceeded its authority by adopting fuel economy standards ""that effectively mandate EVs while at the same time force the internal combustion engine out of the market.""The lawmakers said the agency ""accounted for EVs in its regulatory baseline and factored that baseline into its determination of the maximum achievable CAFE standards.""House Republicans last week proposed killing the EV tax credit and repealing fuel efficiency rules designed to prod automakers into building more zero-emission vehicles as part of a broad-based tax reform bill.Federal law requires NHTSA to set CAFE standards at the maximum feasible level.The Environmental Protection Agency said it was beginning the effort to reverse the Biden administration's parallel vehicle emissions rules that would force automakers to build a rising number of EVs but has not begun any effort to rescind California's legal authority for its 2035 EV rules. EPA is also reconsidering rules awarding credits for ""start-stop"" technology, which is in around half of new vehicles.NHTSA said last year the rule would reduce gasoline consumption by 64 billion gallons and cut emissions by 659 million metric tons.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RR143:0-us-expected-to-declare-biden-fuel-economy-rules-exceeded-legal-authority/"

Uber Stock Is Dropping. Blame Elon Musk and Tesla. — Barrons.com,1747861560000,"Al RootUber Technologies stock fell Wednesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he didn't need to buy the ride-hailing company. Wait. Was that on the table?Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday afternoon in Austin, Texas, where Tesla plans to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in June. Faber asked why Tesla doesn't buy Uber to give its business an immediate boost.""There's no need,"" answered Musk.Uber has created a digital platform to manage demand for rides and the supply of drivers. Musk says Tesla can develop an app of its own. What is more, ""we have millions of cars that will be able to operate autonomously,"" he said.Musk is referring to Tesla vehicles owned by regular car drivers, which will be able to operate autonomously when Tesla's full self-driving software gets good enough. He envisions Tesla owners renting out their vehicles to Tesla to make money when they aren't using them. It would be like Airbnb, but for cars.Uber stock lost 3.5%, closing at $88.67, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The effects of autonomous-driving technology have been debated for months. Fear about self-driving cars, and how they might affect companies such as Uber, likely reached its peak a year ago, around the time Musk announced that Tesla would host a robo-taxi event in August. The event was eventually held in October.From the end of 2023 into the summer of 2024, Uber stock declined about 5%.Still, Uber has its own self-driving strategy, announcing deals with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to Uber's networks in Austin and Atlanta. That helped calm investors' nerves. Coming into Wednesday trading, Uber stock was up about 55% from its summer 2024 lows.Investors are still waiting to see how the self-driving ride-hailing market works, but it doesn't have to be a winner-take-all market. For starters, fleets of cars are expensive. Musk believes one of Tesla's key advantages is all the car buyers who have already paid for Teslas. Having a partner like Uber could lower capital costs for Waymo, or even for Tesla.There is also something to be said for the Uber brand. ""Uber"" has essentially become the verb for using a ride-hailing service.Musk's comments might have surprised investors, a little, eliminating any small price premium reflecting the long odds of a buyout.The challenge now is to understand and assess the development of the robo-taxi market in the coming years, and then to pick winners and losers.Uber is valued at $190 billion, more than General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis combined. Tesla is valued north of $1 trillion.Exactly how much is related to robo-taxis is hard to say. Most bullish Tesla analysts say a majority of the value is due to Tesla's AI expertise, which teaches cars to drive themselves.Alphabet, which controls Waymo, is valued at $2 trillion. How much Waymo of that represents is hard to say. Most of Alphabet's money still comes from Google's search business. Still, Waymo's progress has been substantial. It completes more than 250,000 driverless rides a week and announced Tuesday it had passed 10 million fully autonomous paid rides.It is safe to say there are hundreds of billions, even trillions, of value at stake in driverless cars. That is a large enough market to keep investors optimistic about Uber.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Insider Sells $198 Million in Shares While Musk's U.S. Role Looms,1747324854000,"May 15 - Robyn Denholm, Tesla's board chair, sold about $198 million of her company shares over the past six months, according to a New York Times analysis of securities filings.Those sales, which bring her lifetime profit from Tesla stock to more than $530 million since 2018, were executed under a prearranged trading plan set last summer.The timing coincided with CEO Elon Musk's stint in the Trump administration, which has been linked to a drop in car sales and contributed to Tesla's first-quarter profit falling to its lowest level in four years.Denholm earned her shares through options granted between 2014 and 2020. For example, she exercised roughly 112,000 options at about $24.73 per share before immediately selling them above $270 each.Critics say such insider sales can signal wavering confidence.

Tesla Just Made It Nearly Impossible for Small Investors to Sue The Company's Executive,1747686571000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA just rewrote the rules of the gameagain. In a recent SEC filing, the company announced it will now block shareholders who own less than 3% of its stock from filing derivative lawsuits against its executives or board. That threshold? About 97 million shares, or roughly $34 billion at Friday's close. This follows Tesla's shift from Delaware to Texas incorporation, where a new law gives companies the green light to set their own barriers to such lawsuitssomething Delaware doesn't allow.The timing isn't lost on anyone. Back in 2018, Richard Tornetta filed suit over Elon Musk's massive $56 billion pay package, owning just nine shares. A Delaware judge sided with Tornetta last year, voiding the package and calling it unfair to shareholders. Musk is now appealing. But with Tesla's new bylaw in place, future Tornettas might not even get through the door. It's a preemptive shield, born in Texas, that could reshape how corporate power is challengedif it's challenged at all.For investors, this move could cut both ways. On one hand, it limits legal distractions and could streamline decision-making. On the other, it raises questions about checks and balances at one of the world's most closely watched companies. If this approach catches on with other Texas-incorporated firms, it may mark the start of a broader shiftone where only the biggest shareholders get a seat in the courtroom.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8d520adb4094b:0-tesla-just-made-it-nearly-impossible-for-small-investors-to-sue-the-company-s-executive/

"US Chip, Software Giants Enter 'Watershed Moment' in AI Shift to Mideast, Wedbush Says",1747668681000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and other US semiconductor and software giants face a ""watershed moment"" as the artificial intelligence revolution expands to the Middle East, Wedbush Securities said Monday in a note. ""The market opportunity in Saudi Arabia and UAE alone could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years, and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names,"" Wedbush said. President Donald Trump's Middle East trip culminated in deals for the delivery of 18,000 Nvidia chips to Saudi Arabia for a 500-megawatt data center and for the largest AI data center outside the US in Abu Dhabi, the report said. The announcements mark the ""start of a new era of growth for the US tech sector and a gamechanger for the industry,"" said the investment firm. The ""massive AI buildout"" in Saudi Arabia and the UAE might open up a ""huge opportunity"" and total addressable market in the next decade for Nvidia, Palantir Technologies NASDAQ:PLTR , Microsoft, Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and other companies, Wedbush said. The tech boom in the Middle East ""also speaks to this global game of high stakes poker being played by the Trump administration"" as China faces US chip restrictions, the report said.

Tesla Stock Drops. Its Self-Driving Cars May Not Be Self Driving After All. — Barrons.com,1747858560000,"Al RootTesla stock rose early Wednesday but couldn't hold gains, and shares sold off with the market. Still, it's been a strong May for shares. Comments Elon Musk made on Tuesday show just how important June will be for the shares.One surprise from Musk, however, is that Tesla's first self-driving taxis might not be as self-driving as investors expect.Tesla stock traded as high as $347.25 but closed at $334.62, down 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Last week, Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber in Austin, Texas. Musk confirmed that Tesla plans to start robo-taxi service in the city by the end of June. He also indicated that there would be a small number of cars initially, humans would supervise operations, and the self-driving Teslas would only be able to go where the company was confident they could succeed.Having humans oversee and potentially intervene as tele0perators might not be exactly what investors expected for a robotaxi service, though. Musk has his reasons. ""We're going to be extremely paranoid about deployment, as we should.""""It's prudent for us to start with a small number,"" he added. That could be as low as 10. The goal is to be at a thousand in a few months and ""hundreds of thousands"" by the end of 2026. Any Tesla that has the correct hardware can become a robo-taxi when the AI-trained self-driving software gets good enough. At that point, Tesla owners can elect to use their vehicles to make money in the robo-taxi network when they aren't using their vehicles.That's the goal, anyway. Musk also reiterated his expectation that Tesla could license its technology to other auto makers. Seeing Teslas drive themselves in Austin successfully could be a catalyst for a deal.Musk also addressed self-driving technology competition with BYD. He's confident Tesla has a superior product, citing local independent testing.Earlier on Tuesday, via video at a conference in Qatar, Musk also said that he expects to be CEO in five years — and he had a lot to say. Musk said he would spend less time in Washington, D.C., in April, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He added that he expects to reduce his political spending. The reduction can have a significant impact on 2025 midterm races,"" says Carl Tobias, Williams Chair at the University of Richmond Law School. He hopes Musk's D.C. departure will reduce or end some of the ""destructive activity"" undertaken by DOGE. Investors hope less politics can help heal any brand damage from Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration.Musk stepping back from politics and speaking positively about this company and Tesla's AI technology are to be expected. Still, it's what investors wanted to hear — now Musk needs to deliver.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent. Higher yields tend to compress valuations for growth stocks, which rely on future earnings.Read more: Adani, Tata, Vedanta make a power play for coal-fired projects after five-year lullThe downbeat session came just after markets closed out a stellar week. Investors had cheered a breakthrough in trade negotiations, with the U.S. and China agreeing to pause tariff hikes, lifting global risk appetite. The Nasdaq had rallied over 7 percent last week, while the S&P 500 gained more than 5 percent over five straight sessions. The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone. Walmart shares slipped 1.7 percent after President Trump suggested the retailer should shoulder the burden of tariffs, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said CEO Doug McMillon had agreed to absorb some levies. Netflix dropped 2 percent after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral, citing its sharp rally. Reddit fell nearly 7 percent after Wells Fargo flagged long-term risks from AI-powered search displacing traditional web traffic, cutting the stock to equal weight.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Tesla's Robotaxi Revolution: Is it Too Late to Buy the Stock?,1747842900000,"Robotaxi is a word that once was the exclusive to the world of science fiction. As it turns out, Demolition Man is about to manifest itself in reality. Elon Musk revealed that Tesla ( TSLA ) is going to begin deploying self-driving taxi cabs to the streets of the US. It’s only a matter of time before transportation as a whole is drastically changed forever. The democratization of getting from point A to point B. Henry Ford is blushing somewhere.Of course, I understand that Elon isn’t everybody’s favorite anymore. Political motivations have created diverging feelings amongst us. For those that know me, at this point you realize that I couldn’t care less about politics. In my opinion, it’s theatre, sensationalized to evoke your emotions and get you to click and share articles. Here, I want to look at the inner workings of Tesla’s chart and try to figure out where the next moves might run into trouble.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Tesla’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70b91188a094b:0-tesla-s-robotaxi-revolution-is-it-too-late-to-buy-the-stock/

Tesla Stock Is Falling. There's a New Board Member. — Barrons.com,1747660020000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling early Monday. The electric-vehicle maker has a new board member for investors to get to know.Shares of the electric vehicle maker were 4% down at $335.86, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 1% and 0.5% lower, respectively.Tesla appointed retired Chipotle Mexican Grill CFO Jack Hartung to the board of directors on Friday. He will serve on the audit committee and his appointment is effective on June 1.Hartung spent a quarter-century at Chipotle, starting when the restaurant chain had less than 200 stores. Today, Chipotle has more than 3,700 locations.The move, for now, expands Tesla's board to nine. The other members are board chair Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, J.B. Straubel, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and of course, Elon Musk.Tesla also included the disclosure that a son-in-law of Hartung has been a ""non-executive, salaried employee of Tesla since December 2016, and does not share a household with Mr. Hartung.""Expansion of the board with outside finance experience will likely be seen as a positive for the company, although board members don't typically move stocks.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Wall Street futures slip after three-day rally as traders await Powell speech,1747307739000,"US stock futures edged lower Thursday after three straight days of gains, as markets digested a temporary truce in U.S.-China tariff tensions and eyed fresh economic data for clues on inflation and growth. All eyes now turn to US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to speak at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C., on May 15. Powell faces mounting pressure from President Trump, who has been openly urging the Fed to begin cutting interest rates.Futures linked to the S&P 500 were down 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.7 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also declined, falling 128 points, or 0.3 percent.Also read: Told Apple CEO Tim Cook that I don't want him to build in India: Donald TrumpThe cautious mood followed news that Washington and Beijing have paused their tit-for-tat tariff war, easing some pressure on equities. Confidence in the near-term market outlook got a further lift earlier this week from promising US inflation data and signs of resilient tech momentum.Among individual names, Foot Locker shares skyrocketed over 68 percent after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Dick’s Sporting Goods is nearing a $2.3 billion acquisition deal for the footwear retailer. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth dropped 6 percent following reports of a Justice Department probe—although the company said it has not been notified of any such investigation.Tech giants continued to lead the rally this week. Nvidia and Tesla have jumped more than 16 percent, while Meta Platforms has surged 11.3 percent. Amazon and Alphabet also notched gains of more than 8 percent. The Nasdaq Composite is up 6.8 percent so far this week, outpacing the S&P 500’s 4.1 percent gain and the Dow’s 1.9 percent rise.Read more: NSE shareholder base crosses 1 lakh-mark as it still awaits IPO nodHelping fuel the positive sentiment was April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed inflation rising 0.2 percent for the month—right in line with expectations.

Economists expect the headline PPI to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month in April, with the core figure, which excludes food and energy, also forecast to increase 0.3 percent.Investors will also parse through retail sales, industrial production, and weekly jobless claims data, all scheduled for release before the market opens.

China's Factory Boom Can't Hide a Crumbling Consumer Engine,1747659462000,"Industrial output in China just beat expectationsbut investors aren't celebrating yet. Factories posted a solid 6.1% year-on-year growth in April, surprising to the upside despite trade war aftershocks. But consumer spending? That's where the story softens. Retail sales came in weaker than expected at 5.1%, and car salestypically a reliable growth driverbarely moved. Even with subsidies in play, Chinese households are still hesitant to open their wallets, pointing to broader issues with wage growth, job security, and ongoing deflationary pressure.The property market remains a drag. Investment in real estate continues to fall, home prices are slipping faster, and household savings are hitting record highs as consumers shift more cash into time deposits. That's not a great sign for domestic demand. Infrastructure is holding up thanks to government bond issuance, but manufacturing investment is beginning to look shaky. Trade may have gotten a temporary breather from the 90-day US tariff pause, but uncertainty around the next phase could still weigh on corporate planning. Exporters have been rerouting shipments to Southeast Asia and Europebut that workaround has its limits.Even so, the resilience in China's factory data has prompted analysts at Nomura, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan to raise their 2025 growth forecasts to around 4.5%. That's still shy of Beijing's 5% target. For companies like Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and others deeply tied to China's economic health, the picture remains nuanced: production is holding up, but without a real revival in consumer confidence, the runway for sustainable growth could be shorter than hoped. The next few monthsespecially with policymakers hinting at more supportcould be critical in setting the tone for the rest of the year.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:91a731d1b094b:0-china-s-factory-boom-can-t-hide-a-crumbling-consumer-engine/

Why Tesla’s 60% Surge Should Keep Going Into Summer,1747659300000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:TSLA] Shares of Tesla Inc. NASDAQ:TSLA closed just under $350 last week , capping off a blistering rally that has seen the stock climb 60% from its April lows. While it still has ground to cover before revisiting the highs near $500 from last December, momentum is clearly back . The company is starting to look more like Tesla, which energized investors in 2020 and 2021: ambitious, dynamic, and positioned for long-term dominance.Much of this move began after the company's latest earnings report in late April. Though the results fell short of Wall Street's expectations on a headline basis, the update cleared a cloud of uncertainty over the stock. Since then, sentiment has flipped decisively, with retail and institutional investors jumping back in.Musk Refocuses and Markets ApproveIn addition to the shift in sentiment post-earnings , CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he would be stepping back from White House-related efforts to dedicate more time to Tesla has also helped calm investor nerves. With confidence restored in leadership focus, the narrative quickly returned to the company's product pipeline, growth initiatives , and competitive advantages.The improving mood has now been supercharged by broader macro headlines, specifically around U.S. and China trade tensions . Developments suggesting a rollback of certain tariffs have helped power the latest leg higher, particularly given how sensitive Tesla's supply chain and demand dynamics are to the global EV ecosystem.$1 Trillion Market Cap ReclaimedTesla's valuation has surged in tandem with its share price. Last week, the company reclaimed a $1 trillion market cap for the first time in months, adding psychological weight to the rally. Market cap milestones don't impact fundamentals directly, but they do influence narrative, and the narrative right now is one of resurgence.At the technical level, shares are trading in a strong uptrend. The stock has cleared key  heavy-volume resistance points , and momentum indicators continue strengthening. The RSI is now around 70 , indicating overbought conditions, but not yet at the type of extended levels that would typically flash warning signs. This momentum could extend through the summer with the bulls firmly in contro l.Analysts Are Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:TSLA] The recent wave of analyst upgrades adds further weight to the bullish outlook. Last week, Mizuho's Vijay Rakesh boosted his price target on Tesla to $390 from $325, maintaining an Outperform rating . Rakesh cited the positive impact of easing trade tensions, particularly concerning electric vehicle parts imports, as a key driver.While he flagged the potential headwind of reduced EV subsidies in the U.S., he maintained a confident view of Tesla's macro setup and growth path  in the automotive space.This echoes Piper Sandler's move earlier this month when they issued a fresh $400 target on the stock . Taken together, these revised outlooks point to a growing consensus: Tesla's upside may only just be reawakening.Even after the recent run, these targets imply 12% to 15% additional upside , with some bulls calling for more if economic conditions remain favorable.Room to Run Into the SummerOne of the most encouraging aspects of Tesla's rebound is how balanced the rally has been. This isn't just a short squeeze or a speculative pop; it's a sustained move supported by technicals, macro tailwinds, and analyst validation . If trade headlines continue to improve, and the company delivers on growth metrics in the second half of the year, the stock could continue pushing toward those higher price targets.While the relative strength index is something to monitor, the current positioning suggests any short-term pullback could be shallow and met with eager buying. With institutional sentiment turning more positive and Tesla returning to a leadership role in tech, investors are beginning to price in a scenario where the stock retests and potentially surpasses its previous highs .Why This Rally May Still Be in Its Early StagesTesla has already made a 60% move in a matter of weeks, but the catalysts behind the rally suggest it may still be in the early days. With the $1 trillion milestone back in the rearview mirror, improved U.S.–China trade dynamics, and price targets climbing from top-tier analysts, this is a stock with the wind at its back.Momentum, macro, and Musk are all lining up, which could make Tesla one of the standout performers of the summer .Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:3a116684b094b:0-why-tesla-s-60-surge-should-keep-going-into-summer/
General Motors Ceases Vehicle Exports to China From the United States,1747829160000,"General Motors Company GM last week informed its employees and dealers involved in its China export operations that it will no longer ship vehicles from the United States to China. This decision comes amid ongoing trade and tariff negotiations between the United States and China.GM had been exporting vehicles to China through its premium import brand, The Durant Guild, which accounted for less than 0.1% of its total sales in the country, per a company spokesperson. Due to major shifts in economic conditions, GM has decided to restructure the Durant Guild and streamline its operations in China. Previously, U.S.-made goods imported into China were subject to tariffs exceeding 100%, though these were temporarily reduced as part of a 90-day agreement between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2025, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 442,000 vehicles in China, marking year-over-year sales growth and the third straight quarter of increasing market share. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, jumped 53.2% compared to the same period last year. GM, which already offers the most extensive NEV lineup among global automakers in China, plans to expand its portfolio further in 2025 by introducing extended-range electric vehicles, ensuring at least one NEV option for every new locally launched model. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .In April, GM’s rival, Ford Motor Company F, paused shipments of several U.S.-built vehicles, including the F-150 Raptor, Mustang, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator, to China due to retaliatory tariffs that pushed import taxes as high as 150%. Ford is considered one of the automakers most capable of handling tariffs, as roughly 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built domestically. However, Ford may still increase prices on new vehicles if tariff woes deepen.Last month, Tesla, Inc. TSLA also halted new orders for its Model S and Model X on its Chinese website after China increased tariffs on U.S. imports. New orders for both Tesla models were also no longer accessible through the automaker's WeChat mini program in China. Rising competition from BYD and other domestic manufacturers has also hurt Tesla's sales in China.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:10ffb6a71094b:0-general-motors-ceases-vehicle-exports-to-china-from-the-united-states/
"Musk took leased cars back so Tesla could use them as ""robotaxis."" Instead, Tesla sold them ",1747306801000,"Tesla last November ended an unusual policy that prohibited U.S. leasing customers from buying their cars at lease-end.The policy started in 2019, when Tesla announced that customers could lease its mass-market Model 3 sedans but would have to return them, at the end of the lease, for use in Tesla's planned ""robotaxi"" network.""You don't have the option of buying,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said at an investor gathering in California in April 2019. ""We want them back."" ""Next year, for sure,"" he added, ""we'll have over 1 million robotaxis on the road.""None of that would prove true. Despite repeated promises, the robotaxis never came. Tesla instead found an unusually lucrative way to make money by flipping many of the off-lease cars to new buyers, according to four people familiar with Tesla's retail operations.Rather than storing the used cars – a fast-depreciating asset – Tesla started adding features to them through software upgrades. It then sold the vehicles to new customers who would pay thousands more than lease-end buyers would have, the people said.The practice was an easy way to ""jack up the price"" of the used vehicles, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified.Tesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Although counter to what Musk said publicly – and descriptions Tesla gave on its website regarding lease terms – the tactic appears to have been legal. Still, the practice denied lessees the industry-standard option of buying their vehicles and misled them for years about why. It also perpetuated the myth among investors that Tesla was near fully autonomous driving technology. That belief has helped buoy Tesla stock, whose value has far outpaced current earnings and made it the world's most valuable automaker.Throughout the industry, lease contracts typically allow customers to pay monthly to drive a new car for a specified period of time, often between two and four years. The lessee doesn't own the vehicle and must return it to the dealer when the lease expires. In almost all cases, customers can choose to buy the vehicle at lease-end or earlier.Since 2019, Tesla financial statements show, the company has leased to customers worldwide more than 314,000 vehicles, or 4.4% of its total deliveries. It isn't clear whether the no-buy policy applied anywhere outside the United States. The policy was well suited for the years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when vehicle inventories tightened and car prices spiked. More recently, as demand has plummeted – in part because of some consumers' distaste for Musk's right-wing political activities – buyers aren't as enthusiastic for used Teslas. In making upgrades to its off-lease vehicles, the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations told Reuters, the company often added ""Full Self-Driving"" software, which it has sold separately for up to $15,000 and now sells for $8,000. It also added ""acceleration boost,"" an update that can make the car speed up faster, which it sells separately for $2,000. After starting the no-purchase policy with Model 3 leases, Tesla expanded it to leases for all models. Until the recent reversal, its web site said Tesla vehicles delivered after April 15, 2022 ""are not eligible for purchase,"" and that ""Model 3 and Model Y leases are not eligible for purchase regardless of delivery date.""Then, last November 27, Tesla's North America account posted on X, Musk's social media platform: ""Lease buyout now available"" for new contracts. The company also updated its leasing webpage to say leased vehicles ""may be eligible for purchase."" For some former lessees, the discovery has been disappointing. At the start and end of his three-year Model Y lease, Joe Mendenhall told Reuters, Tesla staff said they needed the car back for the robotaxi fleet. But last year he learned Tesla sold the car once he returned it. ""Lies about not being able to buy out my lease,"" the Indianapolis marketing entrepreneur wrote on X. ""The car gets sold at auction, not turned into a robotaxi like I was told. Slow clap @elonmusk.""""CAUGHT HOLDING THE BAG""Tesla's story about keeping used cars for robotaxis fits a long pattern of unfulfilled promises to deploy self-driving vehicles – most recently announced for June in Austin, Texas. Every year since 2016, Musk has promised self-driving Teslas would arrive no later than the following year. In 2019, when Tesla first offered leasing for the Model 3, Musk told podcast host Lex Fridman that the ability to add autonomous-driving software would make every used Tesla an ""appreciating asset.""Some investors have referenced the alleged inventory of leased vehicles as a promising strategy. As recently as October – ahead of a Hollywood event where Tesla displayed a concept ""Cybercab"" robotaxi – Ark Investment Management, long bullish on Tesla stock, said the off-lease inventory could help quickly ramp-up an autonomous ride-hailing service.""To jumpstart the service, it could deploy a fleet of existing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including those coming off lease,"" Ark said in a research note at the time. Sam Korus, a director of research at Ark, this week said that Tesla, even without the off-lease cars, could still have other options, including new or third-party vehicles. Others have long had doubts. When Tesla in 2019 announced it was prohibiting lease purchases because of its robotaxi plans, Evercore ISI analysts reacted in a research note: ""uhmmm, what??"" The announcement ""is an indication that Tesla believes their ride-hailing network is going to be a viable business in three years,"" the analysts added. ""Put us in the extremely skeptical camp.""As a rule, auto dealers avoid holding used inventory because used cars generally depreciate rapidly. Michael Minick, a former Tesla sales representative and one of the people familiar with the sale of formerly leased cars, told Reuters the company wouldn't allow cars to ""just sit on lots and lose value."" ""I knew that wasn't true,"" added Minick, who was among thousands of Tesla employees laid off during a restructuring last year.For most car companies, offering lease buyouts is a ""no-brainer"" because dealers don't have to find a new buyer when a lease ends, said Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at automotive data provider Edmunds. Now that used Tesla values are ""kind of tanking,"" Yoon said, the company most likely ended the lease-end-purchase ban to avoid being ""caught holding the bag.""As Tesla models age and face rising competition from other electric vehicle makers, the cars now lose value faster than almost any other vehicle. An analysis by CarGurus, a used-car sales and data service, found average selling prices of used Teslas have fallen 7.6% over the last year, compared to a decline of 0.8% for a composite index of all brands. Prices for Tesla's Cybertruck have plunged 46% over the last year, while Model Y prices fell 14.1%.During Tesla's January earnings call, Vaibhav Taneja, the company's chief financial officer, blamed ""lower profit from used car business"" as a reason for declining margins at one of its units. Unlike almost all other automakers with U.S. sales, Tesla owns and operates its own dealerships.At dealerships before the lease policy changed, one of the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations said, customers sometimes asked why used prices were so similar to those of some new models. Salespeople would cite the software upgrades to those interested in buying. For those seeking leases, they continued saying the cars would be used for robotaxis at lease-end. The explanation never changed, the person added, because until November the company never deviated from it. Marshall Distel, a transportation planner from Vermont who leased a Model 3 in 2023, said he understood from researching Tesla's policies that he would have to return the car. At the time, he said, he thought a buyout option would have been nice.Now, he has no interest in buying anything from Musk, whose high-profile activities as an advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump have alienated some consumers. ""I love the car, I just don't like what has been going on at the top with the CEO,"" Distel said. ""I don't want to be associated with that any more.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0WF:0-musk-took-leased-cars-back-so-tesla-could-use-them-as-robotaxis-instead-tesla-sold-them/"
Stocks Decline Pre-Bell as Moody's Downgrades US Credit Ratings,1747654589000,"The benchmark US stock measures were trending downwards before the opening bell Monday as investors assessed Moody's downgrade of the world's largest economy's credit ratings. The S&P 500 declined 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 0.8%, and the Nasdaq fell 1.6% in premarket activity. The indexes finished Friday's trading session higher, with the S&P 500 recording gains for the fifth consecutive day. Moody's on Friday lowered the US government's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Aa1 from Aaa and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The downgrade reflects the increase in government debt and interest payment ratios over more than a decade ""to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" according to Moody's. The downgrade comes as the US and China recently agreed to suspend most duties on each other's goods for 90 days. The two countries had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in the March quarter, representing the first drop since the first quarter of 2022, government data showed late April. US Treasury yields moved higher in premarket action, with the two-year rate inclining 2.1 basis points to 4% and the 10-year rate advancing about 11 basis points to 4.54%. The 30-year rate climbed 12 basis points to more than 5%. With no major economic reports scheduled for Monday, traders will focus on commentary from key central bank officials for clues on future monetary policy, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Earlier in May, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate unchanged and warned that upside risks to inflation and unemployment have increased.

China's BYD turns up heat in Europe with launch of Dolphin Surf EV,1747827863000,"Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD's SZSE:002594 low-cost Dolphin Surf became its 10th model available in Europe on Wednesday, with the Berlin launch increasing pressure on European rivals to produce more affordable alternatives.The car will sell at three price points, from 22,990 euros ($26,100) for a 322-kilometre (200-mile) range, to 24,990 euros for a 507-kilometre range.Until the end of June, the three versions will be available at a discounted price of 19,990-24,990 euros, sales chief Patrick Schulz said on Wednesday.The car piles pressure on European automakers to offer more affordable electric alternatives, with cost still a major barrier to wider adoption of EVs.Only a handful of models, such as the Dacia Spring or Leapmotor's T03, are on sale in Europe for under 20,000 euros, although 11 new models priced under 25,000 euros will go on sale this year, including Volkswagen's XETR:VOW ID.2, the Renault R5, the Fiat Grand Panda, and the Hyundai Inster.""The compact segment is the next frontier for electrification in Europe,"" Maria Grazia Davino, BYD regional managing director for markets including Germany, said in Berlin. ""We think this market has huge potential.""The Chinese version of the vehicle, the Seagull, has fuelled BYD's exponential rise in China, second only to Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA Model Y in total sales in 2024 with over 442,000 registrations.Globally, sales of the model have risen 45% this year so far to 170,000, BYD said on Wednesday.BYD, which last year surpassed Tesla to become the world's largest EV manufacturer, is overhauling its European operations, widening its dealer network, offering more hybrids and hiring managers with local experience, after early stumbles in the region stymied sales.Sales data indicates the revamp is working. In Germany, sales reached 2,791 in the first four months of the year, data from Germany's motor authority KBA showed, fast approaching the 2,891 vehicles it sold all year in 2024.That success is mirrored across Europe, where sales quadrupled in the first quarter to 37,201 cars, in sharp contrast to Tesla's sales, which plunged 37.2%.BYD will enter 12 new markets in Europe this year, Davino said, with sales locations to expand to over 1,000.($1 = 0.8808 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RT0SI:0-china-s-byd-turns-up-heat-in-europe-with-launch-of-dolphin-surf-ev/"

Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college. If they choose not to go to college, the trust will remain till they reach 21.

Tesla Stock Is Falling. Options Activity Is Off the Chart. — Barrons.com,1747302300000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling early Thursday.Shares are still having an incredible week and stock options activity might have helped.Stock in the electric-vehicle maker was 3.4% down at $336.01 in the premarket, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 0.6% and 0.4% lower, respectively.Coming into Thursday trading, Tesla stock was up more than $49, or almost 17%, for the week. Bullish comments from long-term Tesla shareholder Ron Baron, the approaching June launch date for Tesla's planned robo-taxi service, and a potential new lower-priced vehicle are reasons investors might be feeling better.The better mood isn't only reflected in the stock price. It is also expressed in put and call stock options activity.Call options give the holder the right to buy a stock at a fixed price in the future. Holding a call option is a leveraged bet that the share price will rise. The right to buy Tesla stock at $340 in mid-May was worth about $6 on Tuesday. It was worth about $12 on Wednesday, up about 100%. Holding a put option is the opposite, giving the holder the right to sell a stock at a fixed price in the future.Sometimes, options activity can create a feedback loop. Sellers of call options don't always want to take on the risk of a rising stock price. They want to make a commission for selling an option contract. If that's the case, they have to buy shares of Tesla to hedge their exposure.That feedback loop can help explain some short-term moves in Tesla stock. On Wednesday, the five most active call option contracts traded about 533,000 contracts, according to Nasdaq. The five most active put options contrast traded about 251,000 contracts. The put-to-call ratio was o.47. A typical put-to-call ratio is a little less than one.A ratio below 0.5 can also mean more stock buying to hedge call option sales than stock selling to hedge put option sales. More buying than selling pushes the price of anything higher — including Tesla stock.Over time, stock prices, of course, reflect earnings and growth. Over the short term, stock option activity can play a role in stock moves. Whatever the exact reason Tesla stock has risen so much, so quickly, the process is something to behold.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

South Africa's Ramaphosa aims to mend US ties with Musk business push,1747651726000,"South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa plans to discuss business opportunities for Elon Musk's companies during a visit to Washington this week aimed at mending relations with U.S. President Donald Trump , Ramaphosa's spokesperson said on Monday.Trump has taken aim at South Africa during his second term, citing disapproval of its land reform policy and of its genocide case against U.S. ally Israel before the International Court of Justice. His administration cut funding to the country in February and last week granted refugee status to a group of white South Africans it said were facing racial discrimination - a claim the South African government denies.The two heads of state are scheduled to meet on Wednesday. And South African officials have been preparing a trade proposal to present to Trump to reset the relationship. One potential proposal would be for Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA - led by Musk, a close ally and adviser to Trump - to receive favourable tariffs on its imports into South Africa in exchange for building electric vehicle charging stations. ""(It) could be one of the points discussed,"" Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said in response to a text message query on the matter.Asked about the question of licencing for Musk's satellite company Starlink, Magwenya said: ""Certainly, the issue will be discussed."" The United States has pushed some nations facing tariffs to approve Starlink, the Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing State Department cables. Musk, who is South African-born, has previously claimed Starlink was barred from operating in South Africa because he is not Black, an allegation South African officials refuted. South Africa's telecoms regulator said in March that Starlink had not applied for a licence.Musk's false claim appeared to be taking a swipe at local Black Economic Empowerment rules, requiring foreign-owned telecommunications licencees to sell 30% of the equity in their local subsidiaries to historically disadvantaged groups.South Africa's Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen, part of the delegation travelling to the United States on Monday, said he wanted to secure trade benefits for South African farmers.South African agricultural products currently enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Under Trump's tariff regime, however, that is now at risk.""Losing these benefits would be disastrous for farmers, farm workers and the economy at large,"" Steenhuisen said in a statement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RR0DA:0-south-africa-s-ramaphosa-aims-to-mend-us-ties-with-musk-business-push/"

 (22:56 GMT) Press Release: Automotive Properties REIT Reports Financial Results for First Quarter of 2025Automotive Properties REIT Reports Financial Results for First Quarter of 2025Canada NewsWireTORONTO, May 14, 2025TORONTO, May 14, 2025 /CNW/ - Automotive Properties Real Estate Investment Trust TSX:APR.UN (""Automotive Properties REIT"" or the ""REIT"") today announced its financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 (""Q1 2025"").""We expanded our property portfolio into the United States in the first quarter with the completion of our previously announced acquisition of a Tesla collision center property located in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. Subsequent to quarter-end, we added a second U.S. property with the acquisition of a Rivian automotive property located in Tampa, Florida,"" said Milton Lamb, CEO of Automotive Properties REIT. ""These acquisitions are consistent with our strategy of acquiring attractive commercial properties in growing metropolitan markets, and enhancing our tenant and geographic diversification, and also increases our exposure to the electric vehicle and service market in North America.""""For the quarter, we generated growth in key financial performance metrics, including AFFO per unit, reflecting our property acquisitions in the fourth quarter last year and the fixed and CPI-linked contractual rent increases embedded in our leases,"" continued Mr. Lamb. ""Looking ahead, we remain focused on strengthening our financial performance through both organic rental growth and property acquisitions that continue to drive increases in AFFO per Unit.""Q1 2025 Highlights- The REIT generated AFFO per Unit1 of $0.247 (diluted) and paid regular cash distributions of $0.201 per Unit (as defined below) in Q1 2025, representing an AFFO payout ratio1 of approximately 81.4%. For the comparable three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (""Q1 2024""), the REIT generated AFFO per Unit of $0.234 (diluted) and paid cash distributions of $0.201 per Unit, representing an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 85.9%. - The REIT had a Debt to Gross Book Value (""Debt to GBV"")2 ratio of 43.8% as at March 31, 2025, and $55.4 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facilities, $0.1 million of cash on hand, and four unencumbered properties with an aggregate value of approximately $69.4 million. As at the date of this news release, the REIT has approximately $39.4 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facilities, cash on hand of $0.1 million, and five unencumbered properties with an aggregate value of approximately $88.0 million. - On March 11, 2025, the REIT completed the acquisition of a Tesla-tenanted collision center property (the ""Columbus Tesla Property"") located in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, for a purchase price of approximately US$17.8 million plus acquisition costs of approximately US$0.8 million (total of approximately C$26.7 million). The REIT funded the purchase price for the acquisition of the Columbus Tesla Property primarily by drawing on its revolving credit facilities. Subsequent Event- On April 11, 2025, the REIT completed the acquisition of a Rivian-tenanted automotive property in Tampa, Florida (the ""Tampa Property"") for a purchase price of approximately US$13.5 million (approximately C$18.8 million). The REIT funded the purchase price for the acquisition of the Tampa Property with draws on its revolving credit facilities. Financial Results SummaryRental revenue in Q1 2025 increased by 2.1% to $23.9 million, compared to $23.4 million in Q1 2024. The increase in rental revenue reflects growth from properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024 and contractual annual rent increases, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the automotive dealership property located at 8210 and 8220 Kennedy Road and 7 and 13/15 Main Street, in Markham, Ontario (collectively, the ""Kennedy Lands"") in October 2024.The REIT generated total Cash NOI of $20.0 million in Q1 2025, representing an increase of 2.6% compared to Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024 and contractual rent increases, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands. Same Property Cash NOI was $19.5 million in Q1 2025, representing an increase of 2.2% compared to Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to contractual rent increases.The REIT recorded net income and other comprehensive income of $7.6 million in Q1 2025, compared to $20.9 million in Q1 2024. The decrease was primarily due to changes in non-cash fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and foreign exchange foreign contract, investment properties and DUs, IDUs, PDUs and RDUs (collectively ""Unit-based compensation"") in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024, as well as a fair value adjustment to Class B LP Units in Q1 2024. The impact of the movement in the traded value of the REIT Units resulted in an increase in fair value adjustment for Unit-based compensation of $0.8 million in Q1 2025. In Q1 2024, the impact of the movement in the traded value of the REIT units resulted in an increase in fair value adjustment for Class B LP Units and Unit-based compensation of $5.0 million.FFO in Q1 2025 increased 4.1% to $12.6 million, or $0.251 per Unit (diluted), compared to $12.1 million, or $0.241 per Unit (diluted), in Q1 2024. The increase in FFO was primarily attributable to higher rental revenue and lower interest expense, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands.AFFO in Q1 2025 increased 6.0% to $12.4 million, or $0.247 per Unit (diluted), compared to $11.7 million, or $0.234 per Unit (diluted), in Q1 2024. The increase in AFFO reflected the impact of the properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024, contractual rent increases and lower interest costs, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands. Straight-line rent adjustment is excluded from the calculation of AFFO.Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (""ACFO"")[3] for Q1 2025 was $14.1 million, compared to $12.4 million in Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024 and contractual rent increases, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands._________________ 
 (3) ACFO is a non-IFRS measure. See ""Non-IFRS Financial 
 Measures"" at the end of this news releaseCash DistributionsThe REIT is currently paying monthly cash distributions of $0.067 per Unit, representing $0.804 per Unit on an annualized basis. For Q1 2025, the REIT declared and paid regular cash distributions of $9.87 million, or $0.201 per Unit, representing an AFFO payout ratio of 81.4%. The AFFO payout ratio was lower in Q1 2025 compared to the 85.9% AFFO payout ratio in Q1 2024, primarily due to the positive impact of the properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024, contractual rent increases and lower interest costs, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands. The AFFO payout ratio in Q1 2025 excludes the cash portion of the Special Distribution that the REIT paid to unitholders on January 6, 2025.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs at March 31, 2025, the REIT had a Debt to GBV ratio of 43.8%, $55.4 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facilities, $0.1 million of cash on hand, and four unencumbered properties with an aggregate value of approximately $69.4 million. As at the date of this news release, the REIT has approximately $39.4 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facilities, cash on hand of $0.1 million, and five unencumbered properties with an aggregate value of approximately $88.0 million.As at March 31, 2025, 93% of the REIT's debt was fixed with a weighted average interest rate of 4.35%, a weighted average interest rate swap term and mortgages remaining of 4.2 years, and a weighted average term to maturity of debt of 2.4 years.Units OutstandingAs at March 31, 2025, there were 49,117,113 REIT Units and nil Class B LP Units outstanding.OutlookThe REIT is subject to risks associated with inflation, interest rates, currency fluctuations and availability of capital. The REIT is actively monitoring risks associated with trade tariffs and other trade restrictions, which could impact cross-border trade, material costs, and overall economic market conditions in Canada and the United States. While the full extent and impact of these proposed trade tariffs and trade restrictions remains uncertain, the REIT is continuing to assess their potential effect on its business, property valuations and financing conditions.The Canadian and United States automotive and original equipment manufacturer (""OEM"") dealership and service industry is highly fragmented, and the REIT expects continued consolidation over the mid to long term due to increased industry sophistication and growing capital requirements for owner operators, which encourages them to pursue increased economies of scale. The REIT plans to continue to grow its portfolio of properties leased to OEMs, OEM dealers and other automotive related uses.Financial StatementsThe REIT's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related Management's Discussion & Analysis (""MD&A"") for Q1 2025 are available on the REIT's website at www.automotivepropertiesreit.ca and on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.Conference CallManagement of the REIT will host a conference call for analysts and investors on Thursday, May 15, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. (ET).

Markets Beware Progress of Tax and Spending Bill. How Stocks Can Get Hit. — Barrons.com,1747651560000,"When it comes to tackling the government's budget deficit, there are a lot of politicians in Washington who are good at talking the talk, but very few who walk the walk.Just as Congress is trying to push through its latest tax plan, Moody's has downgraded U.S. debt. Combined with comments yesterday from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reminding everyone that tariffs could go back up again, that's a one-two punch that could make investors nervous this week.In a way, the downgrade is purely symbolic. Moody's is the last of the three main ratings firms to do it. And the reasons given are obvious — tax cuts are reducing revenue while spending continues to increase. Despite all the rhetoric about fiscal rectitude, even the latest proposal cuts taxes way more than it reduces spending — and those spending cuts may not hold, since popular programs like Medicaid are being targeted.Some say deficits don't matter. They're right, with one big caveat. They don't matter as long as bond yields stay low.So far, so good. The 10-year Treasury yield is still at around 4.5% — about the same as where it was a year ago. But if budget worries start pushing that yield up significantly, watch out. That will drive down stocks as well as bonds.That's because higher yields reduce the relative valuation of stocks, increase companies' borrowing costs, and ultimately slow economic growth. As Friday's consumer sentiment data showed, shoppers are already worried. A warning from Walmart that prices could rise in the wake of a tariff hit does not help. Earnings from Home Depot, Lowe's, and Target this week will add some more color.For now, deficit worries may well just be hot air in a storm that blows over. But keep an eye on bond yields to learn when all the talk gets real.- Brian Swint*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R. Rublin and deputy editor Ben Levisohn today at noon when they discuss the outlook for financial markets, industry sectors, and individual stocks. Sign up here.***Bessent Dismisses Moody's U.S. Debt Downgrade as 'Lagging Indicator'Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent played down worries about Moody's decision late Friday to downgrade U.S. sovereign debt from AAA status to Aa1, telling NBC News on Sunday that ratings firm actions are ""a lagging indicator."" He blamed federal spending during the Biden administration for what Moody's cited in its reasoning.- Moody's was the last major credit-rating firm to downgrade U.S. debt, warning it is on a trajectory to increase federal government spending. Lawmakers are trying to extend President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which could add $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. - Markets have likely absorbed some of the reaction given that the U.S. hasn't had a perfect AAA rating across all major agencies for some time, said Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. He expects the impact to be minimal. - Recent Treasury auctions show net buying of U.S. debt by indirect bidders such as central banks, according to Ben Emons, chief investment officer and founder of FedWatch Advisors. Weekly Japanese Ministry of Finance data also shows Japan continuing U.S. Treasury purchases. - Trump's temporary pause of 145% tariffs on goods from China improved the macroeconomic outlook considerably, reducing recession risk and helping lift stock markets into positive territory for the year. But Treasury yields also rose from 4.1% back to nearly 4.5%. What's Next: Inflation data doesn't yet reflect the higher tariff levels that were in place in China for more than a month before last week's reprieve. Higher inflation could keep Treasury yields elevated as the Fed hesitates to cut interest rates, which could also pressure U.S. stocks, Emons said.- Laura Sanicola and Janet H. Cho***More Retailers Expected to Detail Effects of Tariffs This WeekAnalysts will listen closely to Target, Home Depot and other retailers reporting earnings this week, especially what they say about how tariffs will affect prices. Walmart said last week that it would have to raise prices to counteract rising costs from tariffs, something President Donald Trump told it to ""eat.""- Tariffs have been discussed on corporate earnings calls in the past two months the most in a decade, according to FactSet. Along the same vein, the word ""uncertainty"" has come up the most since 2020, the year the pandemic hit. Mentions of the word ""recession"" are their highest since the end of 2022. - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday he has spoken with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who said last week the retailer would raise prices in response to tariffs. Trump criticized McMillon's comments in a social media post Saturday telling Walmart to ""eat"" the tariffs and stop blaming them for rising prices. - Bessent told CNN's State of the Union that Walmart would be absorbing some of the tariffs, while acknowledging that ""some may get passed onto consumers."" But he added that inflation was down, notably in the retail price of gasoline. - Trump has insisted that the cost of U.S. tariffs on imported goods won't be borne by American consumers, despite what business leaders have been saying. Last week, the Western-wear retailer Boot Barn highlighted strong sales trends but also said demand -- and its margins -- could take a hit from tariffs. What's Next: After pausing his so-called reciprocal tariffs while bilateral trade deals are discussed, Trump now says various countries will be getting letters telling them what the tariffs on their goods will be. Bessent warned tariff rates of 10% to 49% could come back for countries that don't negotiate in good faith.- Liz Moyer***Tesla's Chinese Deliveries Will Be Closely WatchedTesla has been trying to recover from a brand backlash related to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, and another reading on its progress could come this week, with an update on the electric-vehicle maker's Chinese deliveries. Wall Street is closely watching, and analysts might need to revise second-quarter sales forecasts.- Musk promised in April that he would leave behind his work slashing the federal government and renew his focus on Tesla, where first-quarter delivery numbers fell 13% from a year earlier. Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver 7% fewer cars in the second quarter than a year ago. - Second-quarter sales were looking weak in China in the first six weeks of the quarter, based on registration data that said they fell about 26% from a year ago. April sales in European markets including France, Germany, and the U.K., fell about 49% from a year ago, after dropping 45% in the first quarter. - A figure of 13,000 deliveries in China for the week would be close to flat from a year ago and a sign that things are normalizing, while a figure below 13,000 would make Wall Street analysts reconsider second-quarter estimates. - General Motors is pushing to eliminate or modify California's EV targets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a memo sent to employees. California wants 35% of new car sales to be EVs or plug-in hybrids in 2026, and to eliminate gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. Eleven states are following its model. What's Next: California's EV goals are lofty considering current sales penetration rates are still far below its targets. GM told Barron's in an email that it continues to focus on offering the best and broadest portfolio of vehicles on the market and that it has long supported consistency in emissions regulations.- Al Root and Janet H. Cho***Crypto Industry Hopes for Victory on Stablecoins. What What Comes Next.The crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.- As soon as today, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets such as Treasury bills. - Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and give holders of coins priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy. Stablecoins, with a market value of $250 billion, underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. - The largest stablecoin, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global. Currently used mostly for trading, issuers think stablecoins could challenge traditional payments networks. - There are some issues with the industry's push. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. Second is President Donald Trump. He and his family could profit from majority ownership of stablecoin issuer World Liberty Financial. What's Next: The crypto industry has a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and crypto token issuers. Trump has been more crypto friendly than the Biden administration, but the industry is concerned regulation will get stricter without rules around how they are policed.- Joe Light***Buffett Won't Be on Stage Next Berkshire Meeting: Report It looks like Berkshire Hathaway's 2026 annual meeting in Omaha will be the Greg Abel show. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett won't be on stage to answer shareholder questions next year, according to a report.- Abel, 62, is set to take over as CEO at the beginning of next year. Buffett's daughter Susan, a member of the Berkshire board, told The Omaha World-Herald newspaper that her father felt it was appropriate for Abel to be on stage without him, given Abel's future role. - ""I'm not going to be up there,"" she recalled him saying. ""I'm going to leave it to Greg."" Barron's has reached out to Berkshire for comment. - Buffett surprised Berkshire investors on May 3 when he said he would be stepping down as CEO at year-end. Buffett answered questions for four-and-a-half hours at the recent gathering, and many Berkshire investors would have liked to see him on stage another year. - Some investors thought Buffett would agree to appear in 2026 on stage to help the city of Omaha, which generates considerable revenue from the huge crowd at the annual meeting. An estimated 40,000 people attended the 2025 meeting, but it's likely that number will shrink next year without Buffett. What's Next: An Abel-oriented Q&A session is likely to have one key benefit — more Berkshire-related questions. Many shareholders who would like to better understand the complex and diversified conglomerate have been frustrated that many questions at the annual meeting are unrelated to the company — for example, one of the first questions at the 2025 meeting was about a hot-dog business that a shareholder thought Berkshire owned but is actually owned by Berkshire Partners, a private-equity firm.- Andrew Bary***MarketWatch Wants to Hear From YouClasses and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.

"TSLA: Tesla Stock Gains as Elon Musk Vows to Bet Less on Politics, Focus on Business",1747816255000,"Billionaire CEO spoke at a Qatar conference, saying he planned to still be the Tesla boss five years from now. Shares were the only bright spot in the Big Tech realm. 🚗 Breaking Away from Mag 7 Slump- Tesla stock NASDAQ:TSLA bucked the broader Big Tech, Mag 7 slump on Tuesday, as CEO Elon Musk told a global audience he’s stepping back from political spending to refocus on the business. Speaking via video at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk said he plans to reduce his involvement in US politics — at least for now, at least financially. - “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said. “I think I’ve done enough.” - Estimates show that the billionaire-turned-unelected-politician spent as much as $300 million backing President Trump’s 2024 campaign, emerging as one of the biggest individual political contributors of the cycle. But right now, Musk says he sees “no reason” to continue funding political efforts unless something changes. 📣 Musk Seeks More Control of Tesla- In addition to dialing down his political bets, Musk made it clear he’s sticking with Tesla — and doesn’t plan on leaving anytime soon. Asked if he’d still be Tesla CEO in five years, he answered simply, “Yes,” before adding, “Well, I might die.” - In characteristic fashion, Musk added a dose of nuance to his long-term commitment: he wants voting control to avoid being kicked out by activist shareholders. Later on Tuesday in a CNBC interview, Musk said he’s aiming to increase his stake in Tesla to 25%, up from the 12.77% he currently holds — a position worth over $140 billion. - “That’s the number I’d feel comfortable at, because that’s where I have some control, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out,” Musk explained. “If I’m destroying the value of the company or if I’ve just gone flat-out crazy,” he added, “they could still remove me.” 🤫 Wall Street’s Nod of Approval- Shares of the EV maker rose during a session that saw most of the tech sector in the red. Investors appeared to appreciate Musk’s recommitment to Tesla’s future and his hint at stepping away from politics — a topic that’s drawn controversy and criticism from some shareholders and the broader public. - Less drama and more deliveries? Sounds like a plan, maybe. Especially when looking ahead to the planned robotaxi launch. Musk confirmed that the Cybercab rollout remains on track for June.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:6a7c73d60094b:0-tsla-tesla-stock-gains-as-elon-musk-vows-to-bet-less-on-politics-focus-on-business/
"In Tesla’s wake, more big companies propose voting 'Dexit' to depart Delaware",1747261393000,"In the coming weeks, investors in nine public companies worth at least $1 billion each will vote on proposals to ditch Delaware as their place of incorporation, potentially denting the state's longtime reputation as Corporate America's capital, Reuters has found.Five companies with a stock market value of at least $1 billion have moved their legal home out of Delaware since last year, in what some have nicknamed ""Dexit."" Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA made a high-profile move to Texas last year and in April, President Donald Trump’s social media company Trump Media & Technology NASDAQ:DJT , which owns the Truth Social platform, decamped to Florida.Most of the companies are dominated by a significant shareholder or founder. Delaware judges have expanded the court's most stringent legal standard to a growing range of situations involving controllers, increasing the risk of shareholder lawsuits. The decisions culminated with the blockbuster ruling last year that rescinded Musk’s $56 billion pay package from Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA .Less than an hour after the ruling, Musk said on X: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.”Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla soon reincorporated in Texas. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Trump Media, which is controlled by a trust that owns shares on behalf of President Trump and is overseen by his oldest son, said in its March proxy statement that Delaware's ""increasingly litigious environment facing corporations with controlling stockholders has created unpredictability in decision-making.” The company cited the Musk pay ruling as an example. It is now incorporated in Florida. Dropbox NASDAQ:DBX and The Trade Desk NASDAQ:TTD , which each has a large shareholder, and Cannae Holdings NYSE:CNNE have moved their charter to Nevada from Delaware. They did not respond to a request for comment. Among the companies set to vote on proposals to leave are Simon Property Group NYSE:SPG , which is seeking shareholder approval on Wednesday to reincorporate in Indiana, and gaming platform Roblox NYSE:RBLX , which wants to move to Nevada. Unlike many of the other companies that have proposed a ""Dexit,"" Simon does not have a controlling shareholder. It declined to comment on its reasons for proposing a move, referring to its latest proxy statement. Roblox said that Nevada law provides greater predictability. To be sure, the share of Delaware-based companies in the Russell 3000 index, which covers nearly all public companies, continues to grow, rising to 62% last year from 56% in 2020, according to ISS-Corporate. However, 2024 was the first year that more companies in the Russell Index left Delaware than moved their incorporation to the state. “On the Richter scale, it’s not that high,” said Benjamin Edwards, a professor at the UNLV School of Law, of the changes. “But it’s still shaking the ground.”FEARING AN EXODUSDelaware, which has no sales tax, gets around a third of its general budget revenue from fees and taxes related to chartering businesses. Fearing an exodus of companies leaving after the judicial rulings, the state enacted legislation in March that limits the role of the state’s judges in reviewing certain corporate deals.It also limited the scope of so-called ""books and records"" requests, a legal tool often used by shareholder attorneys to try to obtain directors' emails and texts.Despite the recent changes, corporate law in Delaware remains relatively strict when it comes to insiders making deals that would likely benefit them directly, such as a deal to buy assets from a controlling shareholder or Musk and his Tesla pay arrangement, legal experts said. ""That's one area where Delaware has consistently said, 'Look, we're going to kick the tires of those decisions with a little bit extra force',"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.Delaware law typically requires a company that strikes a deal with a controlling shareholder to prove the arrangement met a strict standard showing the price and process were fair, unless it was negotiated by independent directors or approved by shareholders. In Nevada, the same controlling shareholder deal would likely be protected by a legal standard known as the business judgment rule, which shields against lawsuits, regardless of how it was negotiated and approved, legal experts said. Talley said Nevada directors are protected unless they engage in fraud. ""It's actually okay to engage in self-dealing, as long as you don't lie about it,"" he said.A state's corporate law governs a company's relationship with shareholders and typically does not affect legal rights of employees or consumers. In Texas, where Tesla and SpaceX are now incorporated, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on Wednesday amendments to its corporate code that are aimed at reducing the threat of shareholder litigation, in part by allowing companies to set stock ownership thresholds for lawsuits. The plaintiff in the Musk pay case owned just nine shares when he filed suit in 2018.The Texas law is effective immediately. Eric Lentell, the general counsel at Delaware-chartered Archer Aviation NYSE:ACHR , said the aircraft developer is considering reincorporating in Texas and believes directors of other public companies should reconsider Delaware. After a Delaware judge refused last year to recognize a vote by Tesla investors to reinstate Musk's pay, Lentell said it signaled that Delaware judges “have become kind of activist in nature"" by appearing to rewrite settled law. “I think that’s where people get nervous,” he said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0XR:0-in-tesla-s-wake-more-big-companies-propose-voting-dexit-to-depart-delaware/"

Lockheed Stock Just Dropped $12. This Is Why. — Barrons.com,1747255140000,"Al RootLockheed Martin stock dropped about $12 in the blink of an eye on Wednesday.Midday, the defense contractor's shares sunk to $447.20 from $459.40. Management comments at a BofA Securities investor conference looked like the best reason.Lockheed CFO Evan Scott presented and said there could be delays for the F-35 production lot 18 award from the U.S. Defense Department. The F-35 is the company's advanced fighter jet — the Pentagon awarded a Lot 18 contract in December worth $11.8 billion for 145 jets.Scott said Wednesday that lots 18 and 19 could be combined into a single award.""On the plus side, that accelerates...roughly 150 jets of backlog potentially into the second quarter. However, the overall award now is probably going to happen later in the second quarter than if Lot 18 had been a standalone,"" he said.That delay could pressure second-quarter estimates, something investors might not like. What's more, the company is seeing cost pressures in some of its classified programs.Lockheed stock came off its lows for the day, but still ended the session 1.9% lower at $451. In comparison, the S&P 500 was flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%.Coming into Wednesday trading, Lockheed had fallen about 16% since the Nov. 5 presidential election.

Best-Performing ETFs of Last Week,1747645740000,"U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, marking the fifth consecutive day of gains and capping off a robust week for Wall Street. Investors brushed off disappointing consumer sentiment data and lingering inflation concerns to quite an extent. The S&P 500 added 5.3%, the Dow Jones advanced 3.4% and the Nasdaq rose 7.2% last week.Technology stocks powered much of the rally. NVIDIA NVDA and Tesla TSLA shares surged last week, due to Trump's Middle East dealmaking tour. Saudi Arabia approved the use of SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service for aviation and maritime use. Musk also said he plans to bring robotaxis to the country. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will send 18,000 AI chips to Saudi Arabia.Consumer Sentiment Slips, Inflation Expectations RiseDespite the market's gains, economic data revealed persistent consumer unease. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to its second-lowest level on record. Moreover, consumers now anticipate prices to rise by 7.3% over the next year, indicating an increase from 6.5% the previous month.Trade Truce Eases Investor FearsInvestor sentiment was buoyed by a 90-day tariff truce between U.S. and Chinese officials, calming fears of an escalating trade war. The agreement helped drive risk-on behavior and renewed confidence in the markets.“Markets are repricing the stagflation risk right now,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, as quoted on CNBC. “The U.S. consumer may say he/she is worried, but they aren’t spending like they are. Consumption trumps all once you filter out all the noise.”Looking Ahead: Tariff Uncertainty RemainsWhile the truce brought temporary relief, trade uncertainty looms. President Donald Trump announced that his administration will begin sending letters to various countries outlining new tariff rates within the next two to three weeks. These letters would replace direct negotiations in cases where time constraints exist.Winning ETFs in FocusAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of last week.YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF SMCY – Up 27.6% last weekThe YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF seeks current income and exposure to the share price of the common stock of Super Micro Computer, Inc., subject to a limit on potential investment gains.

Ford and Tesla Are Best-Positioned for Trump's Car Tariffs. These Companies Are the Worst. — Barrons.com,1747254480000,"By Al RootWith more tariff certainty, investors — with some help from Wall Street — can better assess the impact levies have on auto makers and new-car demand.The impact is still significant. The U.S. domestic industry, however, might be in better shape than investors suspect. Tesla is in the best position of any car company, followed by Ford Motor. German auto makers have the biggest problem.In late April, after heavy lobbying by the industry, President Donald Trump modified his auto tariff policies. There is still a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, but there was some relief on imported parts. What's more, auto tariffs don't stack on top of other tariffs related to fentanyl, steel, aluminum, or other factors.As a result of the changes, Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow cut his estimate for per-car tariff impacts from an average of more than $6,000 per vehicle to a little more than $3,000. That increase is about 6% of the average car price. That doesn't mean car prices will rise by 6%, though. Suppliers and auto makers will absorb some of the impacts.The per-unit cost varies widely by model and by auto maker. Cost increases can be as high as 17% for some models and as low as zero.Overall, Jewsikow projects zero cost increases for Tesla. It manufactures all the cars it sells domestically, and the parts credits should be enough to mitigate tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant parts. Ford and General Motors are expected to see per-unit cost increases of $1,277 and $1,866, respectively.Ford imports about 20% of its volume. GM imports closer to 40%. Stellantis and Honda Motor also have average impacts of less than $2,000 per vehicle. German auto makers will see the most significant impact. Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group face per-unit cost headwinds of $5,941, $8,237, and $11,894, respectively.""We were surprised by the limited tariffs projected for Stellantis and Honda, and the magnitude of tariff costs on a per-unit basis for certain import brands, particularly the large luxury brands,"" Jewsikow wrote in a Wednesday report.Stellantis suspended its guidance for 2025. Honda offered guidance for its fiscal year 2026 on May 13. It expects to make an operating profit of about $3.4 billion, down from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. Included in the guidance is a $3.6 billion headwind in the company's automotive business.The impact on domestic auto makers looks to be manageable. Still, higher costs will result in almost one million fewer cars sold in 2025, Jewsikow adds. He forecasts just under 15 million new cars sold in the U.S. this year, down from a prior forecast of about 15.5 million and down from about 16 million sold in 2024.Exactly which companies will lose volume is hard to say. It's likely to be auto makers facing steeper cost increases, which would be another positive for domestic auto makers.As of Wednesday's close, shares of Ford are flat since the Nov. 5 presidential election, while the S&P 500 is up about 2%. GM and Stellantis shares are down 6% and 22%, respectively.News other than tariffs can move stock prices, but the declines for GM and Stellantis might be a little overdone, given Guggenhiem's insights.Tesla stock has gained 38% since the election, but a lot more than tariffs move shares of Elon Musk's car company.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The Top Corporate Board Directors — Journal Report,1747614660000,"By Theo FrancisThey oversee airlines, oil companies, home-improvement chains and makers of products ranging from deodorant to fighter jets. About half are CEOs, or once were. Roughly as many identify as women or racial or ethnic minorities.They are the 250 most influential and effective directors at big, publicly traded U.S. companies, as ranked in the inaugural Wall Street Journal Top Board Directors listing.At the very top: Edward Philip, the independent chairman of United Airlines. Philip made his name in executive roles at Lycos, a pioneering internet search company, and went on to head operations for Partners In Health, the global nonprofit bringing medical care to some of the world's poorest places.Joining Philip as the five highest-ranked directors are Home Depot's Stephanie Linnartz, who once ran sportswear brand Under Armour; Debra Reed-Klages, a former utility-company CEO on the boards of Caterpillar, Chevron and Lockheed Martin; Joseph Jimenez, a former Novartis CEO who is lead director at Procter & Gamble and on the boards of General Motors and Century Therapeutics; and Gregory Boyce, a former coal-company CEO on the board of mining company Newmont.""We're in an increasingly complex world where corporate leadership is being called on to grapple with all kinds of challenges and opportunities,"" says Rick Wartzman, co-president of Bendable Labs, the research and consulting firm that created the ranking for The Wall Street Journal Leadership Institute. ""Directors are being called on to take an ever more important role.""To find the most effective and influential directors, Bendable analyzed data on more than 4,000 nonemployee directors of S&P 500 companies, as well as data on those companies and others at which the directors served. The analysis took into account a range of third-party scores, including company performance, activist vulnerability and corporate governance, as well as data on directors' backgrounds and their roles within their boards. (See more methodology details here.)""So much of what happens in board deliberations and in board meetings, we really don't know,"" Wartzman says. ""We tried to take what is public and available and where there are credible third-party assessments of different risks to a company where boards seemed to have an important role to play.""The ranking seeks to shed light on a longstanding but elusive question in corporate governance: What makes a good director?The rise of independentsFor decades, directors even at the largest publicly traded companies were often appointed from the ranks of big shareholders, upper management and their associates in business and society. These days, no more than one or two members of the C-suite sit around the boardroom table, and most or all of the other directors count as independent under the rules of the markets the company's shares trade on. (Those rules don't cover every kind of potential conflict.)Yet boards remain notoriously difficult to evaluate. Directors oversee the company for shareholders, but management is responsible for execution. Beyond formal securities disclosures and corporate reports, it can be hard to draw a bead on what boards do. Most seek consensus and minimize disagreement, especially in public.Ultimately, corporate boards are like firehouses, says B. Espen Eckbo, a Dartmouth College finance professor who ran its corporate-governance center for two decades. Until there's a fire, it is hard to know how well they function.""The company runs itself in good times — but when it gets to some times with fires, then the board has to really step up and save the company from making big mistakes,"" says Eckbo, who wasn't involved in the Journal's ranking. ""The best way to go about it is to create a board that thinks like shareholders.""Academic research hasn't found strong evidence for director characteristics that contribute directly to company performance, although most experts believe that sizable stock ownership likely spurs directors to think more like the shareholders they represent, and that having an outside CEO on the board seems to help, but more than one isn't necessarily better.CEO experience makes directors more sensitive to the challenges faced by executives — and to the line between the board's role and the chief executive's, says Lloyd Carney, No. 73 on the list and a longtime tech executive who currently chairs the board of Grid Dynamics and sits on the boards of Visa and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.""Hire the CEO, support the CEO, fire the CEO if you have to, and always guide the long-term strategy,"" Carney says. ""The last thing you want is the board flying in every three months trying to tell you how to run the business.""Parsing the dataIn the Journal's ranking, the 250 top directors vary in the length and breadth of their board service. About half the directors sit on just one board, as do seven of the top 10 directors, while most of the rest sit on two; only a few dozen directors sit on three or four (45 and 11, respectively). Among the directors sitting on four are former Alcatel-Lucent CEO Patricia Russo, who is on the boards of Merck, General Motors, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and KKR.Half a dozen directors on the list have held a seat for at least a quarter-century — including longtime tech executive and investor Harvey Jones, an Nvidia director since 1993, and Russo, who has been on the board of Merck and predecessor Schering-Plough since 1995. Another 17 took at least one of their seats within the past year or so, including Marissa Mayer, the former Yahoo chief executive who joined AT&T's board last year. (The ranking only considers directors set to serve terms through year-end 2025.)Directors in the ranking had no role in creating it, though some are expected to be unpaid participants in a new conference series by the WSJ Leadership Institute.In all, 48 companies have at least three directors among the top 250. Home Depot and Allstate have nine apiece, while Procter & Gamble has eight and Wells Fargo has seven — in each case, majorities of each board.""Part of what makes a great board is constructive collaboration with each other and with management,"" says Linnartz, who sits on Home Depot's audit and compensation committees.At Home Depot, each director meets quarterly with a member of senior management, whether to tour stores or dig into some operational challenge, getting to know the business deeply.When the coronavirus pandemic hit two years after she joined Home Depot's board, the board's familiarity with the company and its systematic strategic planning were evident, says Linnartz. The foundation was in place for a rapid expansion of the company's business to meet demand.Individual vs. corporate factorsCompany characteristics and results play a small part in the ranking, contributing around 10% of each director's score on average. A one-year total shareholder return that surpassed other companies in the same industry, or the S&P 500 as a whole, boosted scores, while measures of poor audit quality, activist vulnerability and high-profile controversies reduced them.More influential: a measure of corporate prominence, based on the company's ranking in Fortune Magazine's list of the biggest and most influential companies, which accounted for around a fifth of the average combined score.Individual characteristics were the biggest driver in the ranking, contributing about two-thirds of directors' final scores on average.In some cases, a strong individual score made up for a poor company showing: Donald Knauss, a director of Target, McKesson and Kellanova, ranked No. 13 overall despite low corporate scores brought on by audit-quality penalties at all three companies, and penalties for activist vulnerability and litigation at McKesson and Target. Helping him: past CEO experience, serving on the boards of three such prominent companies, and leadership roles on each of the boards, including serving as lead director at Kellanova and board chairman at McKesson.Many of the highest-scoring directors got there in part by serving on or chairing at least one of three key board committees: the audit committee, tasked with a range of financial oversight; the compensation committee, which sets CEO pay; and the nomination committee, which vets candidates for board seats.The five top-ranked directors, for example, hold a combined 15 seats on those three committees, at nine S&P 500 companies, and chaired five of them. (Some serve on other committees as well.) Four also served as lead independent director or independent chairman for one or more companies: Jimenez at P&G and Century Therapeutics, Philip at United Airlines, Reed-Klages at Caterpillar and Boyce at Newmont.""Typically, those leadership positions are based on the experience the other directors value in that director,"" says Knauss, who previously ran Clorox.More is lessThe ranking also docked 15 directors for serving on all three of the key committees, on the grounds that it could blunt a director's effectiveness.That rule bumped Robyn Denholm, Tesla's high-profile board chair, from the top spot, landing her at No. 8 instead. Denholm chairs Tesla's audit committee and sits on its compensation and nominating committees, roles that contributed to criticism by Delaware's Court of Chancery when it found the company cut corners when awarding CEO Elon Musk a pay package that ran to billions of dollars in stock options.A spokesman for Denholm declined to comment.Four directors making the list did so despite receiving less than 80% shareholder support in proxy voting, including Ellen Kullman, lead director at Dell Technologies, with 62.7%, and Carney, who chairs the Grid Dynamics nominating committee, with 72.2%.Most big-company directors win 90% support or better, and analysts often consider anything under 80% as cause for concern. Investors often oppose committee chairs based on fixed voting policies or to make a statement. Some withholding support from Carney flagged that women make up less than 30% of Grid Dynamics' board.Carney notes just two of Grid Dynamics' eight nonemployee directors are white men. He concluded the board didn't need to change as it grappled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then home to nearly half of the company's employees.""We have who we need to make the company successful,"" Carney says. ""My focus is, how do I keep my employees safe, how do I keep the company executing to its true north?""One thing that is difficult to capture in any rankings: personality traits like flexibility, the courage to question decisions and a clear vision of the distinction between the board's role and management.""On paper he or she could have the most stellar background or track record but not really say much, not have much to add — is that value to the company and shareholders?"" says Constantine Alexandrakis, CEO of Russell Reynolds Associates, which places directors and helps boards evaluate their own effectiveness. ""Or are they taking up a seat that could be filled by someone who has a more thoughtful approach?""Ken Denman, No. 14 in the Journal ranking and chair of Costco Wholesale's audit committee and Motorola Solutions' governance and nominating committee, says he looks for intellectual curiosity in potential board members, as well as an understanding of the board's role in asking questions without micromanaging.""At the top level, I think board work is all about being part of an effective team,"" says Denman, who has served as CEO of several tech companies, including one acquired by Apple in 2016.""While the company may have a particular mission, a particular focus, a particular area of expertise — inevitably the world changes,"" Denman says. ""Each person has to know, here's what I can bring to the table.""Theo Francis is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter based in Washington, D.C.

Tesla Stock Rose. Why the Shares Are on a Great Run. — Barrons.com,1747253760000,"Al RootTesla stock jumped again on Wednesday as investors looked to the future.Shares of the electric-vehicle maker added 4.1%, closing at $347.60 apiece, while the S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%.News about potential compensation for CEO Elon Musk might be helping. Tesla's board is looking into a new pay package for Musk, the Financial Times reported recently.He was notably awarded some 300 million incentive-laden options in 2018, but that pay package is being contested in Delaware courts. The options are worth roughly $90 billion at current prices for Tesla shares.Any new pay package would likely be hefty, but most investors want to keep Musk around. Tesla didn't respond to Barron's request for comment.Tesla hasn't scheduled its annual meeting of shareholders yet. An annual proxy statement and annual meeting would be a good time to sort out pay details.The early rise on Tuesday adds to an incredible month for the stock. The shares closed at $334.07 on Tuesday, the highest close since February, leaving shares up more than 18% in May. Shares were also up 40% since Tesla reported its first-quarter results on April 22.Those results were relatively weak: Tesla's operating profits missed estimates as deliveries fell 13% year over year. But CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more time at Tesla and less time in Washington, D.C.Figuring out exactly where Musk is spending his time is hard to do. He was in Saudi Arabia with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, along with other U.S. business leaders.He also said Tesla would launch a self-driving robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June — on schedule.That was good news. Investors are very focused on autonomous vehicles. Baron Capital founder and Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said Tuesday that autonomy can expand Tesla's profits dramatically.Tesla management also believes that self-driving Teslas, and new models, can help repair some of the recent challenges for the brand. ""Our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner,"" said CFO Vaibhav Taneja on the company's first-quarter conference call. Tesla plans to launch a lower-priced model mid-year. ""Additionally, the advancement in FSD-related features, including pilot robotaxi launch in Austin later this year, should help create a new era of demand.""New models, self-driving cars, and improving brand image is the bull case for Tesla stock.

Tesla Demand Hasn't Rebounded Yet. Watch China This Week. — Barrons.com,1747585200000,"Al RootInvestors are looking for evidence that brand ""challenges"" caused by Tesla CEO Elon Musk's politics are fading. They're still waiting. A weekly update from China could be a sign this week.Most recent sales data for the electric vehicle maker just hasn't been good, putting second-quarter delivery estimates at risk. Still, there is one caveat: Most of the data is from April, and Musk announced he would step back from some of his government responsibilities at the end of April.The first three months of the year didn't go as planned. Tesla delivered about 337,000 cars in the first quarter, down 13% from a year earlier and far below what Wall Street expected. At the start of 2025, the first-quarter delivery estimate was about 455,000 vehicles, according to FactSet. The miss even had CFO Vaibhav Taneja citing brand image ""challenges"" on his company's first-quarter earnings conference call.Those challenges might have been part of the reason Musk promised on the conference call to spend more time at Tesla than in Washington, D.C.Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was up 47% since the earnings report. An outside observer might assume some sales pickup has contributed to gains. They would be wrong.April sales in key European markets, including France, Germany, and the U.K., fell about 49% from a year ago after dropping about 45% in the first quarter.Tesla's April U.S. sales dropped about 13% after falling 9% in the first quarter. (Tesla's California sales dipped 15% in the first quarter.)April losses accelerated while things were supposed to be getting better with a new version of the Model Y shipping. The model refresh pickup has been slower than expected. Tesla forecaster, who goes by @troyteslike on X and who is widely followed by Wall Street, projects U.S. Model Y production of about 84,000 in the second quarter, up 17% from the first quarter but down about 12% from a year ago.In China, the second quarter started weakly, likely because of U.S.-China trade tensions. Tesla sales in the first six weeks of the second quarter, based on registration data followed by Wall Street, fell about 26% from a year ago. Chinese sales were roughly flat in the first quarter.Investors can look for 13,000 Chinese deliveries from last week when the number becomes available. That would be close to flat from a year ago and a sign that things were normalizing. Below 13,000, and Wall Street will start to reconsider second-quarter estimates.Currently, Wall Street expects about 412,000 cars delivered, up more than 20% from the first quarter but down 7% from last year.What the impact of falling delivery estimates on the stock is hard to say. They haven't impacted the stock lately. The stock market, of course, is forward-looking. Right now, investors are excited about self-driving taxis and robots. (Tesla is planning to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.) Still, growing car sales certainly couldn't hurt the situation.Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 13% year to date, 12 percentage points behind the S&P 500.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla (TSLA) Faces Scrutiny as Morgan Stanley Flags Valuation Gaps,1747777368000,"Tesla (TSLA, Financials) continues to draw scrutiny from Wall Street as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said the company's valuation is increasingly difficult to justify, even after 15 years on the public market.Tesla trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 181.98x, well above most growth stocks. The stock is up more than 95% over the past 12 months but has declined 15% so far in 2025. According to TipRanks data cited in the report, much of Tesla's valuation rests on opaque or pre-commercialized business segments.Jonas maintains a Buy rating with a $410 price target, suggesting nearly 20% upside. But he said most investors continue to evaluate Tesla solely based on its electric vehicle unitassigning just $50$100 per share to that segmentwhile overlooking other high-potential verticals.Morgan Stanley's sum-of-the-parts model gives significant weight to Tesla's energy storage, robotaxi, and humanoid robot businesses. Jonas estimates the energy storage segment alone is worth $67 per share, excluding future recurring revenues.The autonomous Cybercab service is expected to launch in Austin next month with 10 to 20 vehicles. Additionally, Jonas projected that Tesla's Optimus robot, if it replaces just 1% of global human labor, could add over $300 billion in valueor about $100 per share.Jonas argued that investors' narrow focus is equivalent to valuing Amazon (AMZN, Financials) solely as a retailer or Apple (AAPL, Financials) only as a device company, missing the broader innovation ecosystem.Investors should monitor Tesla's upcoming robotaxi rollout and a potential Optimus event later in 2025 as catalysts that could reshape the company's valuation narrative.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:77874274c094b:0-tesla-tsla-faces-scrutiny-as-morgan-stanley-flags-valuation-gaps/

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Funds: How Fund Managers Are Grappling With 'Autocracy Risk' — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Lewis BrahamThe reason Yves Choueifaty avoids Chinese stocks isn't that there's a trade war. It's that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has virtually unlimited power. To the chief investment officer of Paris-based asset manager Tobam, autocracy itself is China's crucial risk factor.Tobam designed the Tobam Lbrty All World Equity Index, which is tracked by the Westwood Lbrty Global Equity exchange-traded fund. Launched in March, the ETF excludes stocks of autocratic countries such as China, Russia, Turkey, and Thailand — not on ethical grounds, but investment ones.""There is no sustainable [economic] prosperity without solid democratic institutions,"" Choueifaty says. He points to research conducted by Nobel Prize--winning economist Daron Acemoglu indicating that the economic growth of autocracies lags behind democracies.Other fund managers don't exclude autocracies but incorporate what one could call an ""autocracy risk factor"" into their stock analysis. ""We're a growth strategy,"" says David Eiswert, manager of the top-performing T. Rowe Price Global Stock fund. ""What we say is we want to be on 'the right side of change.' That's how we think about normal markets, where the rules are fair. But then in China, we basically developed a strategy where we said we need to be on the right side of Xi. It's not about change; it's about understanding policy, understanding the companies that are favored. That's a really hard game."" The fund currently has just a 3% China stock weighting.The rules are never fair for citizens or businesses in autocracies because the dictator is above the law and there are no checks and balances from other branches of government. That creates an environment in which corruption and bribery are necessary to gain access to the ruler and either win his favor or avoid his wrath. It also means that economic policies are uncertain and can shift overnight based on the autocrat's whims. Such uncertainty increases market volatility and reduces the equity valuations investors should be willing to pay.""A lot of times when autocrats are in a democracy and begin to take control, the first thing they do is try to appease the oligarchs,"" Eiswert says. ""That happened in Nazi Germany, in Turkey, and in Russia. [The autocrat says:] 'You get to run the steel mills. You get to run the energy [industry]. Of course, I'm going to take my cut, but you're going to get rewarded.' ""At first, the stock prices of those companies go up. But eventually, Eiswert says, investors recognize ""'this market is no longer allocating capital in a way we understand.' And then you get compression of [stock valuation] multiples.""Eiswert has begun to see that pattern in the U.S. under President Donald Trump. ""An analogy would be Tesla, when [Elon] Musk backed Trump, and then Trump won,"" he says. ""Tesla's [stock] fundamentals were quite weak, but the stock price in the back half of 2024 went straight up. So the market was initially telling you, 'Oh, we get this. This guy's got an unfair advantage right now.' So the first stage is reward the oligarchs. The leader picks the winners."" But the next stage is those stocks fall — which Tesla, down 17% this year, has done.Analyzing autocracy risk means seeing tariffs only as symptoms of a larger problem. This is an important distinction because the market tends to rally whenever Trump pauses the tariffs. But it's the unchecked power he now has in the executive branch to impose them without congressional approval, which tariffs needed in the past, that is the real risk, as it creates uncertainty.This concentration of executive power grew before even Trump's current term. One could see an early autocracy risk signal in the July 2024 Supreme Court ruling extending absolute immunity to prosecution for presidential acts, essentially rendering any president — Republican or Democrat — above the law. Such presidential power has only expanded as Trump has dismantled formerly independent regulatory agencies, challenged basic Constitutional rights like due process, and cut deals with oligarchs seeking his favor.Eiswert sees the latest tariff-off rallies as short term. ""I think the market is pretty sure we're not on an upward sloping line,"" he says. So, what should investors do? Stick with U.S. stock funds that invest in high-quality but reasonably valued large companies that can perform well in difficult environments. (Small companies don't have the same political clout as large ones.) Or consider a global fund that can reduce or increase its U.S. exposure as the manager sees fit. Eiswert has cut his U.S. weighting from 67.5% a year ago to 58.0% as of April 30.Even the strictest autocracies, like China, often have investment opportunities. This is where active management can pay off. ""We do come to binary conclusions, but we do it stock by stock, not country by country,"" says manager Andrew Foster of the top-performing Seafarer Overseas Growth and Income fund. ""If I went around and said I'm going to not invest in certain countries in the emerging markets because of their politics, I don't think I'd invest in a single one ever. I'd be disappointed in the current politics of each."" Instead, he looks for high-quality stocks that are least exposed to autocratic control.It would be foolish to exclude the U.S. entirely, as it's still far from being like China and Russia. ""There is a recession of democracy across the world, including in the U.S.,"" Choueifaty says. ""But for the time being, the United States is in a much better situation. Opponents are not killed. Journalists are not killed.""Barring an extreme turn of events, it's likely to remain that way.Email: editors@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250514001121:0/

Elon Musk to Cut Back Political Spending — WSJ,1747774320000,"By Eliot Brown, Tali Arbel and Joseph PisaniElon Musk says he plans to cut back on political spending, after making huge donations in the 2024 election to boost President Trump.""In terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" he said in a video interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. ""I think I've done enough.""Musk, the world's richest person, who according to filings spent close to $300 million in 2024 to help Trump and other Republicans, indicated he still could increase spending again if conditions change.""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it, "" he said. ""I do not currently see a reason.""Musk played a polarizing role in the early weeks of the Trump administration, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency as it slashed federal spending and jobs.In April, Musk said he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla, his electric-vehicle company. Investors had grown worried that he had taken his eye off the ball, with Tesla's sales and share price dropping during his time in the White House.On Tuesday, asked if he would still be chief executive of Tesla in five years, Musk said, ""Yes."" He then added a caveat, saying, ""Well, I might die.""The Wall Street Journal recently reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Tesla board members reached out to several executive search firms to work on a formal process for finding Tesla's next CEO. The board members, concerned that Musk was spending too much time in Washington, told him he needed to spend more time on Tesla.Tesla later issued a denial and Musk criticized the article on X, his social-media platform.Musk said during the Qatar forum that he wanted enough voting control in Tesla that he can't be ousted by activist investors. He clarified in a CNBC interview later Tuesday that he would want to up his stake in the company to 25%.""That's the number I'd feel comfortable at, because that's where I have some control, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out,"" Musk said, adding that he could still be removed ""if I'm destroying the value of the company or if I've just gone flat-out crazy.""Musk currently owns a 12.77% stake in Tesla, worth more than $140 billion, according to FactSet.Musk shrugged off declining Tesla sales — deliveries fell 13% in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier — saying that while the company had lost some liberal customers over his prominent role in the Trump administration, it had gained others among his political supporters.""Our sales are doing well at this point,"" he said. ""It's already turned around.""Last month when Tesla reported first-quarter earnings, the electric-vehicle maker's net income fell by 71%, in part, on weaker demand .In the CNBC interview, Musk said Tesla was ""seeing a major rebound in demand"" and brushed off concerns about consumer reaction to his political activities. ""When you buy a product, I mean how much do you care about the political views of the CEO?""Musk also said that he expected a handful of autonomous robotaxis would be on roads in Austin, Texas, by the end of June. From there, Tesla will expand to other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. He predicted by year's end there will be hundreds of thousands of self-driving Teslas in the U.S., though not specifically robotaxis.After initially planning to stay out of the 2024 election, Musk became one of the largest individual donors in U.S. election history. Musk then turned his sights to the state level, pouring more than $23 million into a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race in April to boost a Republican-backed candidate. But the effort resulted in a loss — the liberal candidate won.Musk dismissed potential conflicts of interest in his role as a top adviser to Trump and his extensive business interests, which include SpaceX, a leading commercial space-exploration company and government contractor, and xAI, an artificial-intelligence startup.""I have not seen any case where there has been an accusation of conflict, "" he said, adding that his work is only advisory — leaving it up to others in the administration to choose whether to enact his suggested cuts.When asked on Tuesday about the Journal's reporting last year that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin since late 2022, Musk said he spoke to the Russian president once. ""The reported conversations are false.""Write to Eliot Brown at Eliot.Brown@wsj.com and Tali Arbel at tali.arbel@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250520005969:0/
Tesla blocks stockholders with less than 3% shares from suing officers on its behalf,1747442673000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA blocked shareholders who own less than 3% of its shares from suing its directors or officers on behalf of the electric vehicle maker for breach of duties, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.Three percent of Tesla's shares amounts to about 97 million shares worth about $34 billion as of Friday's close.That is far higher than the nine shares owned by Richard Tornetta when he sued Tesla's CEO Elon Musk and several of its directors over his $56 billion pay package in 2018. Tesla was at the time incorporated in Delaware, where such a threshold does not exist.Musk filed an appeal in March to restore his pay package after a Delaware judge last year invalidated it, siding with Tornetta and calling it unfair to Tesla shareholders. The amendment on Thursday to the bylaws of Tesla, now incorporated in Texas, follows a new law in the state this week that allows companies to set a threshold of up to 3% shareholding for derivative lawsuits as part of ""restrictive new provisions to limit abusive shareholder litigation.""

Cantor Sees Tesla Ahead of Lucid,1747774235000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA overtakes Lucid in Cantor's EV showdown, driven by scale advantages and a pipeline of near-term catalysts. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard favors Tesla over Lucid NASDAQ:LCID as the better U.S. EV play, citing Tesla's $1.1 trillion market capover four times Toyota'sversus Lucid's much smaller footprint.Tesla's first quarter underscored both headwinds and strengths: automotive revenue slid 9.2 % year-over-year to $14 billion, dragging total top-line to $19.34 billion and missing consensus by over $2 billion, while energy generation and storage revenues jumped 67 % to $2.73 billion. EPS came in at $0.27, $0.15 below forecasts, yet shares have rallied about 47 % since the April 22 report on easing tariff tensions and Musk's pledge to refocus on Tesla. Lucid, by contrast, remains unprofitable and far smaller in deliveries and scale.Sheppard's bullish case rests on a slate of catalysts: next month's Robotaxi launch in Texas; a lower-priced $30,000 model debut in H1 25; ongoing Full Self-Driving rollouts in China and planned European launches; Optimus humanoid robot production in 2026 with customer deliveries by 2027; and the long-awaited Semi Truck entering production in 2026.

Correction to EV Battery Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs — Barrons.com,1747773720000,"Al RootShares of battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at 263 Hong Kong dollars apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750.""The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It is stepping on the power while Honda is hitting the brakes.Tuesday, Honda said it would ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend Yen10 trillion, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by Yen3 trillion, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda's U.S.-listed American depositary receipts rose 1.2% to $29.62, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach, but also welcome the idea that the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It is also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tim Higgins: Angry Elon Is Back. That's Good for Tesla. — WSJ,1748079000000,"By Tim HigginsListening to Elon Musk these days is to hear a man who feels unfairly treated.And, as he skulks away from the White House with his tail between his legs, he is particularly thin skinned. Angry that he was cast as a Nazi. Angry that some used his politics as an excuse to attack Tesla. Angry that he's being scrutinized.We've seen this before. Musk has always had an incredibly large chip on his shoulder — one fueled by perceived slights and personal grievances, critics expressing disbelief and the chorus of social-media doubters.But history has shown that it can unleash something fierce: Angry Elon. Like the Incredible Hulk busting out of his britches and turning green, Musk goes silent before exploding. These days, Musk again seems to be fuming, his eyes darting upward, his vision clouded red with anger.And Angry Elon could be a very good thing for Tesla investors. It can focus him on executing, on proving everyone wrong. A Musk that executes can go to outer space, can make electric cars mainstream.But investors haven't seen Musk execute in a while.Instead, they've seen promises of a cheap Tesla that would fuel 20 million annual vehicle sales seemingly abandoned. They've seen the Cybertruck flop. They've seen profitability shrink and sales fall for the first time in more than a decade.Worrisome stuff to investors concerned Musk has been too distracted in Washington. Even board members appeared unnerved.But fans remembering the power of Angry Elon drew hope from signs this past week that he might be back. First, via video link to a conference in Qatar, Musk on Tuesday delivered salty answer after salty answer to concerns about the state of his companies.Asked when he might be able to turn things around at Tesla, the chief executive replied, ""It's already turned around.""Musk's proof point? Essentially, the age-old retort by Tesla fans on social media: The stock price, bro!Since announcing on April 22 that he would pare back his time in the Trump administration, Tesla shares have risen 43%. This returned the automaker to the rarefied status of being valued at slightly more than $1 trillion. Overall, those shares are still down both 11% year-to-date and 29% from an all-time high.Analysts estimate Tesla unit sales will finish the year down from 2024. This is a reversal from just a few months ago when they expected year-over-year gains.Musk's vision for the future of Tesla isn't bothered by the boring part of selling electric vehicles. Instead, his future is all about ushering in a new era of robotics — driverless cars and humanoid robots.For roughly a decade, he has said the day was near for Tesla's autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon.com's Zoox have put fully autonomous cars on public roads.On Tuesday, Musk doubled down in a second public appearance, this time on CNBC, reaffirming that Tesla is on track to begin offering driverless cars in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.The plan, he said, is to begin with probably 10 vehicles on the road in the first week, then increase that figure by tens of vehicles each week and probably reach 1,000 within a few months. He added that there would probably be hundreds of thousands of autonomous Tesla vehicles by the end of next year, if not more than one million.It's the kind of ultra-ambitious targets he has promoted before. He just needs to execute.During the CNBC interview, his recent track record in Washington was questioned and he snapped again: ""Why are you attacking this, given that we've made so much progress?""Even as he defended his DOGE efforts, Musk has begun amplifying the idea that he is stepping back from politics after realizing the Republican-controlled Congress lacks the appetite to implement spending reductions. ""I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential,"" he posted Friday. "" @DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.""And robots are his solution.Seeing glimpses of Angry Elon excites supporters the same way Optimistic Elon did almost a year ago at the Tesla annual meeting. His enthusiasm — dancing around on stage — seemed to signal he was dialed in after more than a year of distractions from buying Twitter.After shareholders re-approved his massive pay package, Musk stood on stage painting a bright Tesla future filled with humanoid robots and driverless cars. He suggested that could drive the company's valuation to more than $30 trillion.Now, supporters are hoping Angry Elon is ready to finally deliver.""War time Elon is activated,"" a popular X account called Autism Capital posted in response to Musk's Qatar appearance. Others crowed something similar. ""Elon is in WAR TIME CEO mode,"" a MAGA social-media account posted Wednesday. ""He is done playing around. Total laser focus on execution.""Tesla was founded on a rather unlikely idea of making EVs cool and mainstream. For much of its existence, Tesla has faced criticism that it couldn't succeed. And Musk was out there selling investors and customers on the idea that the vision was, in fact, possible.He just needed to execute. And once he did, it was a real game-changer. Tesla hit its stride in late 2019 and 2020, becoming consistently profitable and cementing Musk's image as one of the most successful entrepreneurs of a generation.Of course, past success isn't a guarantee of future success.Even Tesla's position as the global leader of electric vehicles is under threat from Chinese rivals, such as BYD. It outsold the U.S. EV maker in Europe for the first time last month.Musk, who has long praised his Chinese competitors, claimed he wasn't following the sales race. ""I don't really think about competitors,"" Musk said on CNBC. ""I just think about making the products as perfect as possible.""He just needs to execute.Write to Tim Higgins at tim.higgins@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250524001145:0/
"S&P 500 Climbs on Week, Led by Technology, Consumer Discretionary",1747428317000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.3% this week in a broad climb that pushed the market benchmark back into positive territory for the year. The market benchmark ended Friday's session at 5,958.38 and is now up 7% for the month and 1.3% for 2025. The week started with a relief rally as the Trump administration unveiled a trade deal with China just days after announcing another such deal with the UK. The deal between the US and China calls for a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties on each other's goods. The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. On Friday, Trump said the US will unilaterally set tariffs for many other countries soon. ""We will be telling people what they will be paying to do business in the United States,"" he said. Still, stocks held on to the week's gains, especially in the technology sector, as a number of corporate deals were signed amid Trump's Middle East tour. All of the S&P 500's sectors posted weekly gains. Technology rose 8.1%, followed by a 7.7% gain in consumer discretionary, a 6.6% rise in communication services and a 5.5% increase in industrials. Energy and financials rose more than 3% each, followed by smaller gains in other sectors. Super Micro Computer NASDAQ:SMCI had the largest percentage increase in the technology sector, surging 44% as the company said it signed a memorandum of understanding with DataVolt to develop hyperscale AI campuses in Saudi Arabia. The agreement depends on finalizing one or more binding contracts, with the minimum market value of the planned products estimated at $20 billion, it said. First Solar NASDAQ:FSLR was also strong, soaring 27% amid a number of positive analyst actions including a rating upgrade from Wolfe Research. First Solar may benefit from a ""favorable"" US utility-scale solar tax policy, as only ""relatively minor changes"" were proposed in the Republican budget, UBS said in a note to clients while raising its price target on the stock. The consumer discretionary sector was boosted by a 17% jump in Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA shares. Following the trade deal between the US and China, the electric vehicle maker intends to ship components to the US from China for Cybercab and Semi trucks by the end of May, according to a Reuters report. In communication services, Fox's NASDAQ:FOX shares climbed 12% as the media company reported a surprise increase in its fiscal third-quarter earnings. The company's quarterly revenue topped market estimates as the Super Bowl LIX drove sharp gains in its advertising sales. Health care was the weakest sector, eking out a gain of just 0.3%. UnitedHealth Group NYSE:UNH had the largest percentage drop in the sector, falling 23% as a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the matter said the company is facing a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice over possible Medicare fraud tied to its Medicare Advantage operations. The company said it hasn't received any notification from the DOJ. Next week, quarterly earnings reports are expected from Home Depot (HD), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), TJX (TJX), Lowe's (LOW), Medtronic (MDT), Intuit (INTU) and Analog Devices (ADI).

The Food and Drug Administration will stick to its existing process for updating Covid-19 shots for older adults and those at a high risk of severe illness. It's a softer approach than Trump officials had seemed poised to take, according to Barron's reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis.Home Depot, the biggest home-improvement retailer, reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.56 a share, missing analysts' estimates of $3.60. Revenue of $39.9 billion beat forecasts of $39.3 billion. The company said it plans to keep prices unchanged despite new tariffs. Home Depot shares were down 0.6%. Competitor Lowe's, which reports quarterly earnings Wednesday, fell 1.4%.Tesla was up 0.5% after CEO Elon Musk told a conference in Qatar that he expects to still be chief executive in five years, The Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla shares have declined 15% this year but have jumped about 44% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 22. Tesla sold 11,150 cars in China the past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung, up from 3,040 sold the week before.

CATL raised almost $4.6 billion in the world's largest equity offering this year.UnitedHealth gained 1.8%. The shares rose 8.2% on Monday, ending the session at $315.89.

D-Wave management highlighted the technology's applications in tasks such as supply-chain optimization and resource allocation, outside the realm of what classical machines effectively can handle.Amer Sports rose 19% after the sporting goods and apparel company topped first-quarter adjusted earnings estimates and raised fiscal-year profit guidance.Hewlett Packard Enterprise gained 1.5% to $17.72 after analysts at Evercore ISI upgraded shares of the technology company to Outperform from In Line and raised their price target to $22 from $17.Viking Holdings, the expedition cruises company, reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss on a revenue jump of 25% to $897.1 million.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe.

Tesla Stock Rises. Even Hedge Fund Sales Can't Keep It Down. — Barrons.com,1747426500000,"Al RootTesla stock rose Friday to close out another incredible week with a gain as investors bet that Tesla's investments in self-driving cars are about to bear fruit.Suddenly, the troubled automaker no longer looks troubled.Shares of Tesla added 2.1%, closing at $349.98, while the S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%.The rise comes despite quarterly disclosures showing Daniel Loeb's Third Point Investors exited a 500,000-share Tesla stake during the March quarter. It also exited a 670,000-share Meta Platforms stake while buying 1.45 million shares of Nvidia, among other shifts.Investors like to follow what large, successful fund managers are doing, but changes don't always move stocks significantly. What's more, the filing reflects holdings as of the end of March, meaning portfolios could have shifted again since then.Tesla shares rose 17.3% for the week, a fourth consecutive weekly gain. The streak started with an 18% jump the week Tesla reported first-quarter earnings. Numbers were weaker than expected but the company stuck to its timelines for a lower-priced model and for a robotaxi service. The latter is due to start in Austin, Texas, in June.Easing trade tensions between China and the U.S., which boosted most shares, also helped, pointed out Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster in a recent tweet.""Ride-hailing is a massive opportunity,"" he wrote. ""This year in the U.S., Uber and Lyft are expected to generate about $90 billion in gross bookings across roughly four billion rides ...

Elon Musk says ‘I don’t follow BYD’ — but the Chinese EV giant is hard to ignore,1747771607000,"“I don’t follow BYD” – that’s what Elon Musk said in a recent interview with CNBC.The billionaire chief executive of Tesla Inc NASDAQ:TSLA also went on to state that he doesn’t think about competitors at all. His entire focus is solely on making the TSLA product as perfect as humanly possible.While the aforementioned comment reflects Musk’s commitment to innovation, ignoring rivals, particularly BYD, could prove a misstep on his part. Here’s why.BYD’s market dominanceBYD has already surpassed Tesla Inc to become the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles – and that’s when it doesn’t even sell its vehicles in the world’s second-largest auto market, the US.While the multinational based out of Austin, Texas, was once the undisputed leader in the EV space, BYD’s rapid expansion, including the assembly lines it has already established in Brazil, Hungary, Thailand, and Uzbekistan, signals its intent to dominate globally.Elon Musk himself acknowledged recently that without trade barriers, BYD could “demolish most other car companies.” So, if Tesla doesn’t track BYD’s moves, it could end up losing ground in key markets.BYD’s cost advantageBYD’s ability to produce EVs at significantly lower costs is a major threat to Tesla Inc. In fact, experts are now convinced that “no one can match BYD on price, period.”Tesla’s premium pricing strategy works in some markets, but affordability is a key driver of mass adoption. Therefore, if the US electric vehicles behemoth doesn’t analyse BYD’s cost-saving strategies, it may struggle to compete in price-sensitive regions.That’s part of the reason why TSLA is already finding it incrementally more difficult to expand its share in China, which, according to Elon Musk, is “the most competitive auto market.”BYD’s technological advancementsBYD has established itself globally as much more than just a budget EV maker with innovations that sometimes seem light years ahead of its rivals.But if he still ignores BYD’s tech advancements, TSLA risks being blindsided by innovations that could redefine the market. Plus, BYD is offering multiple levels of autonomy on its vehicles for a fraction of the cost compared to Tesla, and its latest charging technology claims to charge an EV in less than 5 minutes, versus 15 minutes for TSLA.Note that analysts are already losing faith in Tesla stock, given the consensus rating currently sits at “hold,” with the average price target indicating potential downside of nearly 20% from here.China’s EV dominanceFinally, China is the world’s largest EV market, and BYD benefits from solid government support. Between 2015 and 2020, BYD received $4.3 billion in state subsidies.Tesla must monitor how BYD leverages this advantage to expand globally. So, ignoring BYD or not following it, as Musk claimed in a CNBC interview today, is not an option.The billionaire must track its strategies, pricing, and innovations to ensure Tesla Inc remains competitive in the evolving EV landscape.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:38e0c86e7094b:0-elon-musk-says-i-don-t-follow-byd-but-the-chinese-ev-giant-is-hard-to-ignore/
Trump Tax Bill Could 'Devastate' Clean Energy. Here Are the Few Bright Spots. — Barrons.com,1748027340000,"By Avi SalzmanInvestors knew that President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would be bad for clean energy. Subsidies for projects like solar and wind farms were bound to be gutted to pay for tax cuts. But the bill that passed the House of Representatives on Thursday was worse than most of them expected.There's a very gloomy future ahead in some areas if the bill isn't changed dramatically in the Senate.""This bill is going to be devastating to the industry if it's passed by the Senate,"" said Heather Cooper, a lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery who works with clean energy companies. ""It takes the tax credits that have been in the code for decades, and that were extended and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act, and it essentially repeals pretty much all of those incentives almost immediately for almost all types of projects.""Cooper said her clients were ""jaw-dropped and dumbfounded that this went through.""""This is a highly robust industry with hundreds of thousands of workers and employees,"" she said. A Princeton University analysis found that the bill almost entirely repeals the Inflation Reduction Act, which would jeopardize more than $500 billion of already-announced clean energy manufacturing projects.Cooper's clients are hopeful that the Senate will change the bill significantly, but she's less optimistic.Certain clean energy industries would get hit harder than others. The worst-hit areas appear to be rooftop solar and electric vehicles, which would quickly lose financial support that they had counted on for years. Areas that appear to have survived with less damage include biofuels, nuclear energy, and carbon capture. But all of those industries have their own problems beyond the bill.Rooftop solarThe bill removes a rooftop solar tax credit that allowed homeowners to take a credit worth 30% of the value of the project. It also limits how companies that lease solar panels to consumers can claim tax credits — an unexpected change that would have a particularly dramatic effect on SunRun, the leader in that industry. It also forbids companies from selling the tax credits to other buyers, taking away a mechanism that had greased the wheels of the industry.SunRun stock fell 37% on Thursday. BMO Markets analyst Ameet Thakkar downgraded SunRun's shares to Underperform and predicted that there will be ""limited political will to claw back residential credits in any Senate version."" Sunnova, another company that leases solar panels to customers, warned investors earlier this year that there's a chance it will not be able to stay in business — even before this bill was finalized.Electric vehiclesMost kinds of EVs will lose access to $7,500 tax credits that will make them less price-competitive against gasoline-powered cars. The bill would also add new fees to buyers of certain low-emission vehicles, adding charges of $250 a year for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids. The EV boom had already begun to slow, but the new costs and loss of tax breaks will almost certainly slow sales further. Tesla may weather the changes better than peers who have a smaller customer base, but it could still be hurt.Utility-scale solarUtilities install large arrays of solar panels to generate electricity. The bill will quickly remove the tax credits they receive for installing them, making them less cost-competitive with fossil-fuel-powered generators, like natural gas plants. Clean energy projects would have to start up within 60 days of passage of the bill to still be eligible.Cooper said her clients who install panels are in a rush to get equipment and get projects started.""I suspect every module manufacturer has gotten 100 phone calls today,"" she said. ""There's gonna be a lot of activity as people scramble to engage in activities in the next 60-something days.""The changes could have an impact on big utility-scale installers like NextEra Energy and AES, whose stocks fell sharply Thursday. Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith downgraded AES stock to Underperform on Tuesday, citing its ""difficult path forward"".Clean energy manufacturingThe bill was mostly a negative for companies that manufacture clean energy products like batteries and solar panels in the United States. It will phase outthe credits supporting manufacturing more quickly than expected, and impose strict rules to forbid tax breaks to companies that rely on Chinese suppliers and other ""foreign entities of concern.""That's particularly bad for battery makers, who are heavily dependent on China. First Solar, which manufactures solar panels for utilities in the U.S., should benefit from the domestic manufacturing rules. But First Solar will likely be hurt by a drop in demand for solar because of the removal of tax credits available to utilities for installing it.WindWind power is and has been in a deep rut. The bill takes away its tax credits, and sunsets credits for wind manufacturing even faster than solar. Wind equipment companies like Vestas will have to rely on overseas business for now. The one bright spot is that the stocks were already beaten down, so they reflect very low expectations.BiofuelsCredits for the production of biofuels from plant and animal byproducts survived the House bill, and production credits were even extended by an extra year. Midwestern congressional representatives like those credits, which help farmers.That political support would seem to be a boon for biofuels players like Darling Industries, Calumet and Neste. But those companies have other problems right now that make them shaky investments, and have sent all the stocks lower this year. There simply isn't enough demand for biofuels, and they're not cost-competitive when gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel prices are cheap like they are today. Other Trump administration policies that pull back support for clean energy are also hurting the industry.NuclearCredits for nuclear energy mostly survived the House bill, though one crucial credit will fade away a year earlier than expected.Both Democrats and Republicans favor nuclear energy, and have called for a ""renaissance."" And the credits' survival is a good sign for owners of existing nuclear reactors, like Constellation Energy.A separate production tax credit available to nuclear power is only available to projects that start construction by the end of 2028 — a relatively short timeline for companies that can take many years to get all the permits and financing. And the tax credits don't solve the bigger problem for nuclear, which is finding utilities, lenders, and a customer base who are willing to take on the financial risk of developing new reactors. Until those issues are cleared up, start-ups like Oklo and Nuscale could still face challenges.Carbon captureThe bill also continues to support carbon capture, a process that involves siphoning off carbon emissions from industrial plants and oil wells, and then liquefying the carbon and storing it underground. Oil companies like Exxon Mobil have been investing in the area, and could profit off the credits. But demand for carbon capture is still scarce, and Trump's rollback of other environmental rules calls into question whether companies will continue to pursue low-carbon strategies.There also aren't many ways for investors to buy into the industry. Occidental Petroleum, the oil company that is farthest along in its carbon-capture efforts, has other problems that have sunk its stock in recent years, like high indebtedness.Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Nvidia seeks Shanghai R&D site after US chip curbs, say sources",1747407998000,"Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA is seeking a site in Shanghai for a research and development centre, three sources close to the matter said, reflecting the strategic significance of the Chinese market where U.S. curbs on advanced chip exports have hit sales.The U.S. chipmaker began the search in early 2025 and is primarily evaluating locations in Shanghai's Minhang and Xuhui districts, one of the sources said. The project gained momentum after a surprise visit to China by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month, said two of the sources.Huang, who has consistently said China is critical to Nvidia's growth, made his visit immediately after the U.S. placed new restrictions on China-bound shipments of its H20 chips, the only AI chip the company can sell legally in China.Huang met senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier He Lifeng and Shanghai's mayor Gong Zheng.Reuters reported earlier this month that Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of the H20 chip for China in the next two months, as it seeks to prop up sales in the country, where it has been lost market share to domestic rivals such as Huawei. ""We are not sending any GPU (graphics processor unit) designs to China to be modified to comply with export controls,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company is leasing a new space for existing employees in China, but no core intellectual property or GPU designs are being sent to that facility or any others in the country, the spokesperson added. When asked by reporters in Taipei on Friday if the report about its plan to set up a research center in Shanghai was true, Huang said: ""We already have a research center in Shanghai. We have 2,000 people in Pudong. Nvidia has been in China for 30 years.""Nvidia currently has offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen, according to its website. China generated $17 billion in revenue for Nvidia in the fiscal year ending January 26, accounting for 13% of the company's total sales. The local government of Shanghai, which hosts China's largest foreign business community, including firms such as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , has expressed willingness to offer incentives for the Nvidia project, including tax reductions, said two of the sources.The local authorities are also considering offering a substantial amount of land to Nvidia for its China R&D centre, one source added. The Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources declined to be named, as the plan is not public.Following his visit to China, Huang told CNBC that the country's AI market could reach approximately $50 billion within the next two-to-three years. He said that being excluded from this rapidly expanding sector would represent a ""tremendous loss"" for Nvidia, especially as competition with Huawei intensifies.During an earnings call in February, before H20 chip sales to China were restricted, Nvidia executives said the company's sales to China were about half the level before U.S. export controls.Since 2022, the U.S. government has imposed restrictions on the export of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China, citing concerns over potential military applications. The Financial Times first reported on Friday about Nvidia's plan to build a R&D centre in China.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RO137:0-nvidia-seeks-shanghai-r-d-site-after-us-chip-curbs-say-sources/"

Elon Musk Shores Up Tesla Leadership and Starlink Plans,1747769704000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA commits Musk's five-year horizon, teases Starlink IPO prospects. Tesla vows Elon Musk will remain CEO through 2030, providing more definitive leadership visibility amid concerns over his political engagements and time split with SpaceX and the Trump Administration.Despite personal blowback from his interventionist statements, Musk said he did what needed to be done, noting that the brand has offset some political fallout with additional sales from right-leaning buyers, even as delivery reports have shown steep declines in North America and Europe. He plans to dial back political spending after forthcoming election defeats and defended his dual roles, underscoring that his commitment to Tesla is ironclad over the next five years.On the SpaceX front, Musk added that Starlink may pursue an IPO eventually, though he's in no rush, highlighting growing confidence in the satellite-internet business after adding roughly 2 million subscribers worldwide. He also confirmed he'll press ahead with his lawsuit against OpenAI, despite the AI pioneer partially reversing its for-profit restructuring plan. Musk's remarks come as investors and analysts grapple with how his political profile and multi-company leadership might influence brand perception and operational focus.Why It Matters: Locking in Musk's CEO tenure for another half-decade reduces one major uncertainty for investors, while Starlink's eventual public listing could unlock substantial value outside Tesla. Tesla stock has taken a hit, with analysts' average 12-month target now at $285.79 that's an 18.6% downside from current levels.

GM's New LMR Battery Could Change the Game: Is it Ready to Lead?,1747399860000,"General Motors GM is setting the stage for a big leap in EV battery innovation. The company just revealed plans for a new lithium manganese-rich (LMR) battery technology that could dramatically lower costs and boost the performance of its largest electric vehicles (EVs). If all goes according to plan, GM could become the first automaker to bring LMR prismatic battery cells to market — a move targeted for 2028.These new batteries are designed for GM’s full-size electric trucks and SUVs like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR chemistry swaps out pricey materials like nickel and cobalt for more common and affordable manganese. This shift not only cuts raw material costs but could also help GM improve the range and weight efficiency of its EVs.GM claims that LMR batteries offer 33% higher energy density than today’s top lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, all while maintaining comparable costs. This means more miles per charge without driving up sticker prices.Production is already on the horizon. Ultium Cells, GM’s joint venture with LG Energy Solution, aims to begin preproduction in late 2027 and full commercial production in 2028. It’s all part of GM’s broader push to scale its Ultium platform and improve EV profitability.But GM isn’t the only auto giant chasing this battery breakthrough. Ford F is also in the race, and it's moving fast. Last month, the company announced that it is developing its own LMR battery chemistry at its Ion Park R&D center in Michigan. Ford has already begun pilot production of second-generation cells and aims to roll out LMR-powered EVs before the decade ends.Ford sees LMR as the “what’s next” solution following its current use of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) and LFP batteries. The company believes the chemistry could unlock longer-range, lower-cost EVs, especially crucial for scaling up mass-market adoption.Tesla TSLA, meanwhile, planted early seeds in this space. CEO Elon Musk floated the idea of high-manganese batteries as far back as 2020 during Tesla’s “Battery Day.” At the time, he said Tesla aimed to create cathodes with one-third manganese content to stretch its nickel supply further. Tesla holds patents related to LMR chemistry, but it is yet to share firm production plans.GM looks set to be the first to market with LMR batteries, Ford is close behind, while Tesla's earlier concepts still await a clear update.The Zacks Rundown for General MotorsShares of General Motors have lost around 6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 13%. From a valuation standpoint, GM trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 5.28, significantly below the industry. It carries a Value Score of A.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2025 sales and EPS implies a 6% and 12% decline, respectively, year on year. Estimates have been southbound over the past 30 days for the current and next quarter, as well as for 2025 and 2026.GM stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:b6722f056094b:0-gm-s-new-lmr-battery-could-change-the-game-is-it-ready-to-lead/

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his right-wing political views and his work for U.S. President Donald Trump. Musk has said he will reduce his work for Trump and focus on Tesla. ""My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days, every few weeks, and to be helpful where I can be helpful,"" he said. A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.""The only things that matter in the long term are autonomy and Optimus,"" Musk told CNBC.Autonomous vehicle technology has been hard to commercialize, with tight regulations and heavy investments forcing many companies to give up. Those still in the race, including Alphabet's Waymo, have faced increased scrutiny.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating collisions involving Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance software in reduced roadway visibility conditions since October. The U.S. road safety regulator asked Tesla last week to answer questions on its paid robotaxi service launch to assess how the cars will perform in poor weather.Tesla is in talks with major automakers to license the FSD software that is expected to underpin its robotaxis, Musk said.To power his broader artificial intelligence vision, Musk's xAI startup has been ramping up its data center capacity to train more advanced models, and its supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, called ""Colossus,"" is touted as the world's largest. xAI will deploy a million of Nvidia's NASDAQ:NVDA advanced Blackwell chips at a new facility near Memphis, Musk said. ""So long as Nvidia is better than what we make, we'll keep buying from Nvidia,"" he said. xAI bought a 1-million -square-foot property in Southwest Memphis, Tennessee, the Greater Memphis Chamber said in March. Musk, who merged xAI with his social media platform X in March, said a merger between Tesla and xAI was not being considered but was ""not out of the question,"" though it would need shareholder approval.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RS0VK:0-tesla-on-track-to-launch-robotaxi-trial-in-austin-texas-by-june-end-musk-says/"
"Tesla Set to Start New Growth Era in AI, Autonomous Tech, Wedbush Says",1748005275000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA is now on the verge of a ""golden age of autonomous growth"" after CEO and founder Elon Musk stepped back from his role in the US Department of Government Efficiency and recommitted to leading the company, Wedbush said in a Friday note.

"Elon Musk Drops Bombshell: Staying at Tesla, Ditching Politics--Stock Reacts Fast",1747768870000,"Elon Musk wants you to know he's not going anywhere. In a remote appearance at the Qatar Economic Forum, the Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA CEO said he plans to lead the company for at least another five years a much-needed dose of reassurance for shareholders rattled by sliding sales and courtroom drama around his scrapped $56 billion pay package. Musk also made it clear: this isn't about the money. It's a reasonable control thing, he said, pushing back on the idea that his push for more Tesla shares is rooted in wealth accumulation.On the business front, Musk downplayed Tesla's recent stumbles, claiming the company's downturn has already turned around. While sales remain weak in Europe, he argued other regions are holding strong and doesn't expect any meaningful shortfall. Investors seemed to like the optimism Tesla shares popped 2.4% at 12.38pm. That bounce offers a breather after the stock shed 14% this year amid concerns about EV demand, pricing pressure, and leadership distractions.Musk also addressed the elephant in the room: his politics. He admitted past political spending may have hurt Tesla's appeal on the left, but claimed it gained support elsewhere. Looking ahead, Musk said he plans to spend a lot less on politics, signaling a shift back toward focus and execution. His parting message? If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it. I do not currently see a reason. Investors may be hoping it stays that way.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:add72a755094b:0-elon-musk-drops-bombshell-staying-at-tesla-ditching-politics-stock-reacts-fast/
Bitcoin Left the Big Banks Behind. Why Their Next Crypto Venture Is Doomed and 5 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com,1747998240000,"Some of America's biggest banks dropped the ball when it came to Bitcoin. Now they're hoping for another opportunity to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but there's little reason to believe they'll succeed.U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup are considering whether they should jointly issue a stablecoin--a crypto token which functions like a digital dollar-- according to The Wall Street Journal.It would be a sharp about-face for the banking industry, which has generally been slow moving in crypto. As recently as Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he is ""not a fan"" of Bitcoin, even as his bank finally allows trading in the token.Stablecoins appear to provide more fertile ground. They could speed up cross-border payments and should be less volatile than Bitcoin and its peers. The GENIUS Act recently passed by the Senate is set to offer some regulatory certainty, establishing criteria on financial risk and the need for liquid assets to back stablecoins.However, banks are already far behind a new circle of players who dominate the stablecoin market. The largest two stablecoin issuers are Tether and Circle. Tether shares ownership with major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while Circle has close ties to leading U.S. exchange Coinbase. They have now been joined by firms including the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, which said in March it would launch its own stablecoin.A cumbersome consortium of banks which is only reluctantly coming round to the idea of cryptos in general is unlikely to make much headway. Even their political connections seem to be left wanting, given just last night President Donald Trump hosted memecoin investors at a private dinner.Bulge bracket banks have consistently been behind the pace when it comes to crypto innovation. It's hard to believe they have a successful gameplan now to go on the offensive.- Adam Clark***Senate Axes California's EV Mandate in Blow to TeslaThe Senate voted to abolish a measure that let California set its own tailpipe emissions standards and canceled its ban on new gasoline-powered car sales by 2035. While the move was favored by other car makers, it's bad news for Tesla's ability to profit from the sale of regulatory credits.- Senators voted 51-44 to nullify a waiver California enacted in 2022 and that 11 other states later adopted that set stricter emissions standards than the federal government. General Motors and other auto makers argued that keeping the waiver could hamstring the industry by forcing electric vehicle sales amid declining demand. - California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others said California has the right to enact regulations to help improve its air quality. But the Senate used the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies. - The California regulations form the basis for Tesla's sales of zero-emission credits. This is a brisk business for Tesla, which sells only electric vehicles, allowing it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to fellow auto makers generated $2.9 billion over the past 12 months. - House members separately passed a federal budget bill that would eliminate or substantially reduce tax credits for clean energy and new and used electric vehicles, and would impose annual fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles. What's Next: Because the House had already passed the resolution on California's waiver, it will head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Democrats warned the use of the Congressional Review Act to undo rules could backfire on Republicans if Democrats could do the same thing.- Janet H. Cho and Al Root***From Tax Breaks to Medicaid Cuts: What's In the Spending BillSenate Republicans now have the driver's seat to steer President Donald Trump's tax and spending plans through by July 4, when the pressure will be mounting to raise the federal borrowing limit. Senators are likely to make changes to the proposal that narrowly passed the House early Thursday.- The House version of the bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lowering the top income tax rate to 37% from 39.6%. As a compromise to blue-state members, lawmakers raised the allowance for state and local taxes to $40,000 for households earning $500,000 or less. - The bill proposes eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest payments for taxpayers who make less than $100,000 and creates $1,000 investment accounts for children born between 2025 and 2029 that can be later withdrawn to pay for college or buy a house. - It stops short of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security income. The House bill gives an extra standard deduction of up to $4,000 for individuals age 65 and over from 2025 to 2028, phasing out at certain levels for individuals and married couples filing jointly. - Medicaid was a big target, facing nearly $700 billion in cuts by increased work requirements and eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment. The bill also cuts food and nutrition benefits for low-income Americans by $267 billion over that time, the Congressional Budget Office projected. What's Next: Tax provisions would increase the federal deficit by $3.8 trillion from 2026 to 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Long-term bond yields are rising on the prospect of the U.S. government issuing trillions of dollars of more debt to finance the GOP's spending plans.- Elizabeth O'Brien and Janet H. Cho***The Fed Is Different Than Other Government Entities, Scotus SaysThe Federal Reserve is different, according to the Supreme Court. While the court granted President Donald Trump's emergency request to fire independent federal agency heads, the unsigned order made a specific point that the central bank wasn't part of that. Financial markets have worried about Fed independence.- The court's ruling focused on cases involving leaders of independent agencies whom Trump had removed from office. Those officers may be removed pending a full hearing of the case, the court ruled. But it called the Fed a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity. - Trump 2.0 has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the man he nominated to take the top spot during his first administration. While the ruling doesn't explicitly prevent Trump from firing Powell or any other central bank officials, it does provide some relief to those concerned about Fed independence. - The court's conservative majority noted the risk that independent commissioners pose to the president's constitutional powers. The three liberal justices said the order allowed the president to overrule a longstanding Supreme Court precedent that prevented the arbitrary removal of agency heads. - This order doesn't formally eliminate that precedent. But it does allow the president to remove Biden administration appointees to the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board while the case is litigated. What's Next: The court's move suggests a willingness to hear arguments for the overturn of the precedent, which is called Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and dates back 90 years. An overturn could further expand presidential power.- Matt Peterson, Nicole Goodkind, and Liz Moyer***Anthropic May Have Broken Through the AI CeilingThe artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic is rolling out its next generation of AI language models it says are able to perform complex, long-running tasks and provide more precise responses to instructions. It may represent a milestone as software developers race to create newer technology.- At its Code w/Claude event on Thursday, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. This is after Anthropic had struggled to make the next generation of large language models. Its Claude 3.5 Opus, announced about a year ago, never materialized and was eventually scrapped. - Anthropic describes Claude Opus 4 as able to work continuously for several hours and excelling at coding, research, writing, and scientific discovery. It can significantly expand the work of AI agents, Anthropic said. Claude Sonnet 4 is less powerful but brings stronger performance to ""everyday use cases,"" it said. - Model-makers have worked around technical problems by creating ""reasoning"" models that work through problems in a drawn-out step-by-step fashion. This produces better answers, but can also take several minutes to get a response. They are hoping new models can produce the same quality but faster. - Anthropic cited a number of companies that have tested Claude Opus 4, including the fintechs Block and Rakuten and Cognition. Companies testing the capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4 include GitHub, which Anthropic said would introduce it as the model behind a new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. What's Next: In brief testing by Barron's, Claude 4.0 provided high-quality answers much faster than OpenAI's current top model, ChatGPT o3. Claude Opus 4 would suggest that Anthropic is the first company to break through this technical ceiling. Others like OpenAI and Alphabet's Google could soon follow.- Adam Levine and Liz Moyer***This Quantum Computing CEO's Ambition to Mirror Nvidia Quantum computing company IonQ has grand aspirations to mirror the success of chip maker Nvidia. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron's he doesn't just want the company to solve the world's most complex problems--he wants it to become an industry leader, envisioning an ascent similar to that of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector.- IonQ was one of the first quantum pure plays to go public. It's the brainchild of Duke professors Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, who aimed to take trapped-ion quantum computing from a laboratory setting to the market.K - ""We're in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,"" de Masi said. ""I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player."" - The stock is on the right track to emulating Nvidia, it has surged 450% over the past 12 months, though it's only up 10% so far in 2025. Shares slid in March as it became the subject of a short report from Kerrisdale Capital, alleging IonQ embellished ""relatively immaterial past achievements"" and provided ""limited, error-prone systems."" de Masi called the allegations ""baseless and nonsense."" - IonQ has yet to turn a profit, and many view quantum as a speculative bet largely trading on headlines and sentiment. What's Next: Ultimately, IonQ's chief executive sees the company following a similar trajectory to that of start-ups. In the future he indicated that he would be open to its acquisition by a larger tech company, particularly one specializing in artificial intelligence.- Mackenzie Tatananni and Elsa Ohlen***Do you remember this week's news?

"Tariff crossfire hits Toyota, Nissan, Ford suppliers in Japan",1747967270000,"Four decades ago, Hiroko Suzuki's father threaded the needle of a U.S. trade war by pushing the family auto-parts business into newer niche products. Now, tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are so sweeping they threaten her own attempt to diversify the 78-year-old company into medical devices.Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has called the U.S. tariffs, including 25% on automobiles, a ""national crisis"" for the world's fourth-largest economy. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, headed to Washington on Friday for a third round of talks.The worry is evident at companies like Kyowa Industrial, a maker of prototype parts and race-car components based in Takasaki, north of Tokyo. Kyowa, which employs 120 people, was among six auto suppliers that told Reuters they were concerned about their ability to withstand the tariff pressure on Japan's car industry.""What in the world are we going to do?"" Suzuki, Kyowa's third-generation president, recalled thinking when the tariffs were announced. ""This is going to be bad."" The problems Kyowa and other auto suppliers face illustrate a decades-long shift in Japan, which no longer floods the world with chips and consumer electronics and is reliant on an auto industry threatened by intense Chinese competition. That marks a contrast with the 1980s, when the U.S. slapped trade barriers on a rising Japan and its then-barnstorming exports.This report, which is based on interviews with a dozen people, including industry executives, bankers and senior government officials, provides a first-hand account of how one firm is grappling with the uncertainty, and details the deepening squeeze on the automotive supply chain at a time of profound disruption.Kyowa and thousands of other small manufacturers comprise an auto-supply network that has for decades pursued a ""monozukuri"" (literally, ""making things"") approach to production. That culture of incremental improvement and assembly-line efficiency, based on methods developed by Toyota, helped make Japan a juggernaut. But the shift to battery-powered smart cars has meant software, in which EV makers such as Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and China's BYD SZSE:002594 excel, has become a bigger selling point.Kyowa started developing neurosurgery instruments in 2016 after Suzuki, now 65, realised the rise of EVs would eventually hammer demand for engine components. It began selling the instruments in the U.S. last year, only to find that Trump's tariffs also applied to medical devices.Kyowa doesn't export auto components to the U.S., but Suzuki worries automakers will force suppliers to cut prices to offset tariffs. So far, that hasn't happened to her.One Subaru Corp TSE:7270 supplier said his company may have to start looking for partners expanding outside the U.S. Major automakers have largely offered muted support for suppliers since Trump's tariff announcements. Last month, Toyota TSE:7203 , Nissan TSE:7201 and Ford NYSE:F sent letters to the U.S. arms of some Japanese suppliers asking for cooperation in the face of tariffs, according to copies reviewed by Reuters, without offering specifics.The letters haven't been previously reported.Nissan told suppliers they should stick to previously agreed prices. It said it was ""not obliged"" to bear the costs of tariffs but that it would shoulder some of the hit for up to four weeks to help secure its supply chain. It added that it could later seek to recover any support payments to suppliers.Reuters couldn't determine how much support, if any, Nissan extended. The automakers haven't sent follow-up letters, according to two suppliers, who allowed Reuters to review the correspondence on condition of anonymity.Nissan told Reuters it was working with suppliers to mitigate the tariff impact and contain costs, including through localisation.Toyota said it would seek to protect its suppliers, dealers, and employees while maintaining customers' trust as it navigated the uncertainty created by the tariffs. Ford told Reuters it was working with suppliers to assess their exposure and potentially reconfigure processes and sourcing. In its letter, Toyota said it understood the ""complexity and financial burden some suppliers are facing"" and asked suppliers to identify and share mitigation measures. Toyota would work with suppliers ""in good faith"", it said.Some Toyota suppliers, including Denso TSE:6902 , have not given earnings forecasts for the coming year, citing uncertainty.Julie Boote, an analyst at research firm Pelham Smithers Associates, said the trade war posed an ""emergency"" for Japan's auto industry that would hasten consolidation.""In order to survive, these automakers will have to work together,"" she said. SQUEEZED ON COSTJapanese manufacturers traditionally put pressure on smaller suppliers to lower prices, said Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member who is now a professor at Keio University. If the tariffs remain in place in the longer term, it would spell more damage for regional economies hollowed out by demographic decline, she said.The risks for Japan are already clear. The economy shrank in the first quarter, and Tokyo has compiled emergency economic measures to ease the pain of tariffs.""Automobile exports are just too important to Japan for a 25% tariff to stay in place,"" said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now a director at consulting firm Eurasia Group. Boling said the U.S. is unlikely to go below the 10% it agreed with Britain.Trump introduced a 25% tariff on automobiles and later a 24% tariff on all Japanese goods. The latter was slashed to 10% for 90 days, which runs out in July.Akazawa, the trade envoy, on Tuesday said Japan was sticking to its guns and wanted tariffs eliminated. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the negotiations.A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration wanted trading partners to align with U.S. efforts to achieve ""fairness and balance in our trading relationships and protect U.S. economic and national security.""Two senior Japanese officials told Reuters Japan's auto industry was increasingly looking like a laggard and needed to use the tariffs as an opportunity to implement sweeping changes to catch up with EV rivals.In a statement, the trade ministry said that regardless of U.S. tariffs, Japan's auto industry needed to respond to significant changes in the competitive environment.Japan's top auto suppliers, called Tier 1, procure parts from Tier 2 suppliers, and so on down the chain. At the bottom are firms that can be little more than neighbourhood workshops grinding out a single part.Government officials have previously urged smaller companies to innovate and consolidate, to gain scale.At regional lender Ashikaga Bank, an automotive industry team supports some 200 companies, around 80% of which are Tier 2 or lower suppliers. A member of the team not authorised to speak publicly said they worried tariffs would lead to higher vehicle prices and a decline in Japanese car sales in the U.S., hitting the bank's clients.Shinichi Iizuka, president of Toa Kogyo, a suspension maker in Subaru's hometown of Ota, near Takasaki, said the tariff burden will likely be shared by consumers, car dealers, automakers and suppliers. Some 70% of Subaru's car sales are in the U.S., where it relies on both local manufacturing and imports. On Monday, Subaru said it would raise prices on several U.S. models.Subaru CFO Shinsuke Toda this month said it was willing to talk with suppliers about sharing their burden, adding the situation remained unclear.IT'S PERSONALSuzuki's drive to diversify Kyowa Industrial into medical devices mirrors the pivot made by her father during the 1980s trade friction, when Kyowa ditched mass production of less-profitable auto parts to focus on higher-margin prototypes and racing-engine components. Suzuki took over in 2000 and her father died in 2013.Before Trump's tariffs, Suzuki had planned to build a U.S. track record in sales of medical equipment to smooth entry into other markets. With the advent of the U.S. trade barriers, she said her team considered moving production to the U.S., where costs are high, or shifting the sales focus to Asia.Given the uncertainty around Trump's announcements, Kyowa is in talks with potential distributors in Singapore and Hong Kong, Suzuki said.Around 70% of Kyowa's business still comes from automakers, while chip-equipment makers and Japan's space program contribute to the remainder. It supplies most Japanese car makers, General Motors NYSE:GM and parts for Formula One race cars.Annual sales are a modest 2 billion yen ($14 million). Still, Kyowa is larger than three-quarters of the roughly 68,000 companies that make up Japan's auto-supply chain, according to research firm Teikoku Databank. For Suzuki, trade friction is also personal, given her deep affection for the U.S. She grew up listening to rock music on U.S. armed forces radio, learned English and went to university in America. She remembers seeing Aerosmith live at their first concert in Japan.""Japan and America have a long history of friendship. I hope they can find a solution,"" she said.($1 = 145.0700 yen)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RO0FY:0-tariff-crossfire-hits-toyota-nissan-ford-suppliers-in-japan/"

CEO Elon Musk cautioned the bot is still very far from its final form, even as Tesla eyes building 5,000 units in 2025, with parts on hand for up to 12,000 if production scales smoothly.Optimus is already working shifts in Tesla's own factories, notably on the Cybercab line at the Texas Gigafactory, where its dexterity and mobility are being stress-tested in real-world tasks. Musk has set a 2026 target to sell Optimus externally at $25,000$30,000 per unit, betting its reinforcement-learning prowess and in-house manufacturing will give Tesla an edge as over 10 rivalsfrom Figure AI and Boston Dynamics to Apple's early-stage proofs and Meta's new robotics divisionrace to commercialize humanoid bots.Why it matters: A production-ready Optimus could revolutionize labor-intensive industries and unlock new revenue streams for Tesla, while the looming 2026 price point puts pressure on competitors and may redefine the economics of automation.Investors will track Tesla's 2025 unit-build progress, upcoming external sales plans and rival demos throughout the year.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:f6274eaf4094b:0-tesla-s-optimus-dances-toward-production/
The Next Major Tech Stock Trend: Humanoid Robotics ,1747763100000,"Maybe it’s just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we’ve experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the “World’s First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.”As this trend gains traction, it’s only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we’ll explore four stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), SoftBank Group (SFTBY), the Global X Robotics & AI ETF (BOTZ) and Tesla (TSLA), that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolutionGrowth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it’s a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world’s most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla’s car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia ,the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia’s chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank’s portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don’t need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:cfd373905094b:0-the-next-major-tech-stock-trend-humanoid-robotics/

US Senate to vote this week on bill to bar California 2035 EV plan,1747754111000,"The U.S. Senate plans to vote this week to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 that has been adopted by 11 other states, Majority Leader John Thune said on Tuesday.The U.S. House approved legislation on May 1 to repeal a waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December, allowing California to mandate at least 80% electric vehicles by 2035.Major automakers had urged the action, saying the rules are not feasible. California says the rules are essential to cut pollution and contends the vote is illegal.Thune said the action effectively imposes a stringent nationwide EV mandate because of California's size and other states adopting it. ""Automakers around the country would be forced to close down a significant part of their traditional vehicle production with serious consequences,"" Thune said. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors NYSE:GM Toyota TSE:7203 Volkswagen XETR:VOW Hyundai KRX:005380 and other major automakers has warned car companies could be ""forced to substantially reduce the number of overall vehicles for sale to inflate their proportion of electric vehicle sales."" The California Air Resources Board rules have been adopted by another 11 states, including New York, Massachusetts and Oregon accounting for nearly 40% of the U.S. auto market — but Vermont and Maryland have delayed compliance . The U.S. House separately voted earlier to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks. Democrats say the Senate is violating the rules by moving ahead. In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act, which only requires a majority of the U.S. Senate. California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models. Automakers say it is impossible for them to meet that figure given current EV sales, which are 10% or lower in some states adopting the rules. California says EVs must hit 68% of new vehicle sales by 2030. The U.S. Transportation Department is separately moving to undo aggressive fuel economy rules adopted by Biden and plans to declare that the Biden administration exceeded its authority in considering EVs when writing the rules.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RS0LJ:0-us-senate-to-vote-this-week-on-bill-to-bar-california-2035-ev-plan/"
Tesla's Emissions Credits Are at Risk After Senate's California Vote — Barrons.com,1747946340000,"Al RootCongress took another step to erode California's ability to regulate emissions affecting air quality, dealing a potentially significantly blow to Tesla's ability to profit from sales of regulatory credits for producing zero-emission vehicles.California has long had a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency that allowed it to regulate its own air quality. But on Thursday morning, the Senate voted to essentially eliminate that, using the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows legislators to overturn the actions of federal agencies.The California Air Resources Board, which sets emission policy for the state, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Democratic lawmakers warned that set a bad precedent for upending agency decisions. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Ron Wyden (D., Ore), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways.""That means Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.The vote is just one twist in a continuing fight over California emissions. California has successfully fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past, and it has support in the current battle.""Today, in an unprecedented and illegal attack on the nation's bedrock air quality law, the United States Senate passed Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions to block states from implementing policies to reduce cancer-causing pollution from motor vehicles,"" said CALSTART, a nonprofit advancing clean transportation technologies, in an emailed statement. ""Authorization for these policies has been a core component of the Clean Air Act for more than 50 years.""Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify a so-called waiver of preemption permitting California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations that the EPA had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that follow California's standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That is a tall order because EVs account for about 20% of California's new car sales today. They are only about 7% to 8% nationwide.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which includes General Motors and Ford Motor, supports rolling back the 2030 requirement.The California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's sales of zero-emission vehicle credits, which it receives because its all-electric fleet allows it to far exceed targets set by regulators. Sales of those credits to auto makers that haven't met the targets have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California news. Tesla stock was up 3.6% in late Thursday trading, despite the vote, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both up 0.4%.One explanation for the move is that investors are increasingly viewing Tesla as an artificial-intelligence company than a car manufacturer. Investors are focusing on the company's plans to launch a robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June — an enterprise that depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to fully overturning the California system.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Insider Sells $198 Million in Shares While Musk's U.S. Role Looms,1747324854000,"May 15 - Robyn Denholm, Tesla's board chair, sold about $198 million of her company shares over the past six months, according to a New York Times analysis of securities filings.Those sales, which bring her lifetime profit from Tesla stock to more than $530 million since 2018, were executed under a prearranged trading plan set last summer.The timing coincided with CEO Elon Musk's stint in the Trump administration, which has been linked to a drop in car sales and contributed to Tesla's first-quarter profit falling to its lowest level in four years.Denholm earned her shares through options granted between 2014 and 2020. For example, she exercised roughly 112,000 options at about $24.73 per share before immediately selling them above $270 each.Critics say such insider sales can signal wavering confidence.

Tesla's China Sales Stink. The Stock Is Rising Because of Musk. — Barrons.com,1747753320000,"Al RootTesla stock jumped early Tuesday despite more weak sales data. Comments from CEO Elon Musk might be helping.Shares have been on a tear since the company reported first-quarter earnings, leading to a stretched valuation for even a hot growth stock.Tesla shares added 1.1% to $345.86 in early trading, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2%.Musk said at a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, according to Bloomberg. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The statement isn't a big surprise for investors, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He has some work to do at Tesla. Tuesday's stock gains come despite Tesla selling 11,150 cars in China this past week, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung. That is a big improvement from the 3,040 sold the week before, but results are still down about 16% from the comparable week in 2024.Investors have been looking for a recovery in Tesla's sales after the number of vehicles delivered dipped 13% in the first quarter from a year ago. It hasn't gotten there yet. In the first seven weeks of the second quarter, Tesla sold about 48,000 vehicles in China, down 24% from the comparable time a year ago.Despite the weak sales, coming into Tuesday trading, Tesla stock was up about 44% since the company reported its first-quarter earnings on April 22. That left shares trading for about 172 times estimated 2025 earnings, up from closer to 72 times a year ago.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas sees the valuation getting even higher before it gets better, although that doesn't mean he believes the stock is going down.The valuation-multiple expansion is hard for value-oriented investors to understand. A year ago, Tesla shares were roughly $200 and Wall Street projected 2025 earnings roughly $3. Now, shares are north of $340, and Wall Street's 2025 EPS estimate is below $2.The stock has risen while estimates have fallen. ""Nearly 15 years after going public, investors struggle to justify the value of Tesla as much as ever before,"" wrote Jonas on Monday, adding he sees the valuation problem getting ""worse before it gets better.""The problem is the future. Tesla is investing heavily in AI and robotics, and those businesses don't generate substantial earnings yet. ""The majority of the company's current $1.1 trillion market [value] is based on businesses that have either poor disclosure, no disclosure, or that have yet to be launched into the commercial market at all,"" added Jonas.He rates Tesla shares Buy and has a $410 price target for the stock, valuing the company at roughly $1.3 trillion. Only $240 billion, or $75 a share, of the valuation comes from the car business.The majority of his value comes from AI-related businesses such as self-driving cars. He doesn't have the robot business in his model, which could easily be worth $100 a share, by his math. Including that number for robots, Tesla's nonautomotive businesses are worth some $1.4 trillion, despite low or no earnings at this point.Jonas' views essentially sums up the difference between Tesla bulls and bears these days. The bulls are full of AI optimism. The bears are confused.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Trump's $4 Trillion Tax Shock: EV Credits Slashed, Rich Rewarded, Markets Rattled",1747932769000,"President Trump's flagship tax bill just scraped through the House in a nail-biting 215214 vote. Dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the package delivers fresh tax breaks for high earners and legacy industrieswhile blowing a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase amid ballooning deficit concerns. Trump called it the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed, but markets are already calculating the long-term cost. The bill now moves to the Senate, where even GOP lawmakers are signaling major revisions ahead.Bond markets may be the first to flinch. Moody's NYSE:MCO already warned of rising debt risksand this bill could pour fuel on that fire. It extends Trump-era tax cuts, raises the SALT cap to $40,000, and adds military and immigration spending increases. At the same time, it phases out EV tax creditsincluding for Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA by 2025. In their place? A deduction for auto loan interest on U.S.-built gas vehicles. Freedom Caucus members also secured cuts to clean energy subsidies and accelerated work requirements for Medicaid, all timed just ahead of the midterms.Investors are now watching the Senate closely. Some Republicans want to make corporate tax cuts permanent. Others are pushing back on healthcare reductions and demanding deeper spending cuts. The final version could still swing dramatically. But for now, this bill looks like a near-term win for fossil fuels, high earners, and Trump's political baseand a potential headache for bondholders, clean tech, and anyone betting on long-term U.S. fiscal discipline.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:17e0c3be9094b:0-trump-s-4-trillion-tax-shock-ev-credits-slashed-rich-rewarded-markets-rattled/

US Senate votes to block California 2035 electric vehicle rules,1747929849000,"The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 that has been adopted by 11 other states representing a third of the U.S. auto market.The vote sends to President Donald Trump the measure to repeal a waiver granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December, allowing California to mandate at least 80% of vehicles be electric vehicles by 2035. The vote is a win for General Motors NYSE:GM , Toyota TSE:7203 and other automakers that heavily lobbied against the rules and a blow to California and environmental groups that say the requirements are essential to ensuring cleaner vehicles and cutting pollution.California first announced a plan in 2020 to require that by 2035 at least 80% of new cars sold be electric and up to 20% plug-in hybrid models.""This Senate vote is illegal,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said, adding the Senate action would cost California taxpayers an estimated $45 billion in additional health care costs. ""We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.""Since 1970, California has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act.Senate Republicans rejected the advice of the parliamentarian in moving forward. In March, the Government Accountability Office said the waivers cannot be repealed under the Congressional Review Act, which only requires a majority of the U.S. Senate.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing GM, Toyota, Volkswagen XETR:VOW , Hyundai KRX:005380 , Stellantis MIL:STLAM and others, praised the vote.""The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,"" the group's CEO, John Bozzella, said. ""In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla.""Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen denounced the vote. ""While our Republican leaders may try to put the horse back in the barn when it comes to electric vehicles, the world has already shifted under their feet,"" she said. Tesla did not immediately comment. GM praised the vote, saying it would ""align emissions standards with today’s market realities.""The Senate separately voted Thursday to rescind the EPA's 2023 approval of California's plans to require a rising number of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks and to bar California's low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines.These are the latest actions in recent months taking aim at electric vehicles.A separate bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday would end a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and repeal vehicle emissions rules designed to prod automakers into building more EVs. It would also phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028.If upheld by the courts, rescinding California's rules will make it easier for automakers to delay or cancel some EV production. Automakers had warned in the coming months they might have been forced to limit gas-powered vehicles in some states.California's rules require 35% of light-duty vehicles in the 2026 model year to be zero-emission models. Automakers say it is impossible for them to meet that figure given current EV sales, which are 10% or lower in some states adopting the rules. Vermont and Maryland have delayed compliance.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RU0RF:0-us-senate-votes-to-block-california-2035-electric-vehicle-rules/"

Update: CATL Goes Public in Hong Kong. The Tesla Battery Supplier Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs. — Barrons.com,1747749120000,"Al RootShares of electric-vehicle-battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at HKD$263 apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750."" The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It's stepping on the gas while Honda is hitting the break.Tuesday, Honda announced plans to ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend 10 trillion Yen, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by 3 trillion Yen, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda's U.S.-listed American Depository Receipts were up 0.8% in early trading, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach while also pleased the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It's also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

This move is designed to enhance the company's asset portfolio and capitalize on emerging opportunities within the capital markets.​ Al Abraaj aims to innovate with shari'a compliant financial instruments to give the Islamic world broader exposure to Bitcoin.The Company has partnered with 10X Capital, the NYC-based investment firm with a track record of managing treasury assets for publicly listed companies, and advising and capitalizing listed Bitcoin Treasury Companies, including most recently advising Nakamoto on its $710M financing NASDAQ:KDLY , the largest capital raise to launch a Bitcoin Treasury Company and the largest private placement for any public bitcoin-related transaction ever. In collaboration with 10X, the Company plans to raise capital to acquire additional Bitcoin, with a goal of maximizing Bitcoin per share.The decision to begin purchasing Bitcoin as a treasury asset follows comprehensive due diligence and aligns with the innovative regulatory framework established by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB).

China's BYD Outsells Tesla in Europe for First Time,1747924980000,"By Mauro OrruChinese auto giant BYD sold more electric vehicles in Europe than Tesla for the first time, a setback for Elon Musk's EV maker as it faces growing competition overseas.Tesla registered 7,165 battery-electric vehicles in Europe last month, down 49% on year according to data from Jato Dynamics, a consumer research group. In contrast, registrations for BYD more than doubled to 7,231 vehicles.""Although the difference between the two brands' monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,"" said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics. ""This is a watershed moment for Europe's car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022.""Tesla sales in Europe have been languishing for months as the company grapples with stiff competition and backlash from Chief Executive Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. New car registrations for Tesla models in the European Union slumped 36% in March, 47% in February and 50% in January, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an industry body.The company in April posted a 71% fall in net income for the first quarter. Musk said at the time that he was going to spend less time in Washington and more overseeing Tesla as investors were concerned that he had taken his eye off the ball.Meanwhile, BYD has been expanding rapidly in Europe even as the EU raised tariffs on China-made EVs. BYD's registrations, including plug-in hybrids, more than quadrupled in April from a year earlier, according to Jato Dynamics data. The research group attributed that growth to a broad and competitive lineup of fully electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.BYD in April reported a doubling in net profit for the first quarter. The company sold more battery EVs than Tesla in the first three months of the year, retaining the crown as the world's top EV seller.Jato Dynamics said BYD's rapid expansion in Europe had already pushed the Chinese company ahead of legacy brands, outselling Fiat and Seat in France.Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522007140:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time/
Market Chatter: Musk Says Tesla Situation Has 'Already Turned Around',1747748181000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg TV that poor sales figures that have plagued the EV-maker this year have ""already turned around.""""We lost some sales on the left, and we gained some sales on the right,"" Musk said. ""The sales numbers are strong. Just look at the stock price. Our stock wouldn't be trading near all-time highs if things weren't in good shape. Don't worry about it.""",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250520:A3381984:0/
"Musk took leased cars back so Tesla could use them as ""robotaxis."" Instead, Tesla sold them ",1747306801000,"Tesla last November ended an unusual policy that prohibited U.S. leasing customers from buying their cars at lease-end.The policy started in 2019, when Tesla announced that customers could lease its mass-market Model 3 sedans but would have to return them, at the end of the lease, for use in Tesla's planned ""robotaxi"" network.""You don't have the option of buying,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said at an investor gathering in California in April 2019. ""We want them back."" ""Next year, for sure,"" he added, ""we'll have over 1 million robotaxis on the road.""None of that would prove true. Despite repeated promises, the robotaxis never came. Tesla instead found an unusually lucrative way to make money by flipping many of the off-lease cars to new buyers, according to four people familiar with Tesla's retail operations.Rather than storing the used cars – a fast-depreciating asset – Tesla started adding features to them through software upgrades. It then sold the vehicles to new customers who would pay thousands more than lease-end buyers would have, the people said.The practice was an easy way to ""jack up the price"" of the used vehicles, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified.Tesla and Musk didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Although counter to what Musk said publicly – and descriptions Tesla gave on its website regarding lease terms – the tactic appears to have been legal. Still, the practice denied lessees the industry-standard option of buying their vehicles and misled them for years about why. It also perpetuated the myth among investors that Tesla was near fully autonomous driving technology. That belief has helped buoy Tesla stock, whose value has far outpaced current earnings and made it the world's most valuable automaker.Throughout the industry, lease contracts typically allow customers to pay monthly to drive a new car for a specified period of time, often between two and four years. The lessee doesn't own the vehicle and must return it to the dealer when the lease expires. In almost all cases, customers can choose to buy the vehicle at lease-end or earlier.Since 2019, Tesla financial statements show, the company has leased to customers worldwide more than 314,000 vehicles, or 4.4% of its total deliveries. It isn't clear whether the no-buy policy applied anywhere outside the United States. The policy was well suited for the years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when vehicle inventories tightened and car prices spiked. More recently, as demand has plummeted – in part because of some consumers' distaste for Musk's right-wing political activities – buyers aren't as enthusiastic for used Teslas. In making upgrades to its off-lease vehicles, the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations told Reuters, the company often added ""Full Self-Driving"" software, which it has sold separately for up to $15,000 and now sells for $8,000. It also added ""acceleration boost,"" an update that can make the car speed up faster, which it sells separately for $2,000. After starting the no-purchase policy with Model 3 leases, Tesla expanded it to leases for all models. Until the recent reversal, its web site said Tesla vehicles delivered after April 15, 2022 ""are not eligible for purchase,"" and that ""Model 3 and Model Y leases are not eligible for purchase regardless of delivery date.""Then, last November 27, Tesla's North America account posted on X, Musk's social media platform: ""Lease buyout now available"" for new contracts. The company also updated its leasing webpage to say leased vehicles ""may be eligible for purchase."" For some former lessees, the discovery has been disappointing. At the start and end of his three-year Model Y lease, Joe Mendenhall told Reuters, Tesla staff said they needed the car back for the robotaxi fleet. But last year he learned Tesla sold the car once he returned it. ""Lies about not being able to buy out my lease,"" the Indianapolis marketing entrepreneur wrote on X. ""The car gets sold at auction, not turned into a robotaxi like I was told. Slow clap @elonmusk.""""CAUGHT HOLDING THE BAG""Tesla's story about keeping used cars for robotaxis fits a long pattern of unfulfilled promises to deploy self-driving vehicles – most recently announced for June in Austin, Texas. Every year since 2016, Musk has promised self-driving Teslas would arrive no later than the following year. In 2019, when Tesla first offered leasing for the Model 3, Musk told podcast host Lex Fridman that the ability to add autonomous-driving software would make every used Tesla an ""appreciating asset.""Some investors have referenced the alleged inventory of leased vehicles as a promising strategy. As recently as October – ahead of a Hollywood event where Tesla displayed a concept ""Cybercab"" robotaxi – Ark Investment Management, long bullish on Tesla stock, said the off-lease inventory could help quickly ramp-up an autonomous ride-hailing service.""To jumpstart the service, it could deploy a fleet of existing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including those coming off lease,"" Ark said in a research note at the time. Sam Korus, a director of research at Ark, this week said that Tesla, even without the off-lease cars, could still have other options, including new or third-party vehicles. Others have long had doubts. When Tesla in 2019 announced it was prohibiting lease purchases because of its robotaxi plans, Evercore ISI analysts reacted in a research note: ""uhmmm, what??"" The announcement ""is an indication that Tesla believes their ride-hailing network is going to be a viable business in three years,"" the analysts added. ""Put us in the extremely skeptical camp.""As a rule, auto dealers avoid holding used inventory because used cars generally depreciate rapidly. Michael Minick, a former Tesla sales representative and one of the people familiar with the sale of formerly leased cars, told Reuters the company wouldn't allow cars to ""just sit on lots and lose value."" ""I knew that wasn't true,"" added Minick, who was among thousands of Tesla employees laid off during a restructuring last year.For most car companies, offering lease buyouts is a ""no-brainer"" because dealers don't have to find a new buyer when a lease ends, said Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at automotive data provider Edmunds. Now that used Tesla values are ""kind of tanking,"" Yoon said, the company most likely ended the lease-end-purchase ban to avoid being ""caught holding the bag.""As Tesla models age and face rising competition from other electric vehicle makers, the cars now lose value faster than almost any other vehicle. An analysis by CarGurus, a used-car sales and data service, found average selling prices of used Teslas have fallen 7.6% over the last year, compared to a decline of 0.8% for a composite index of all brands. Prices for Tesla's Cybertruck have plunged 46% over the last year, while Model Y prices fell 14.1%.During Tesla's January earnings call, Vaibhav Taneja, the company's chief financial officer, blamed ""lower profit from used car business"" as a reason for declining margins at one of its units. Unlike almost all other automakers with U.S. sales, Tesla owns and operates its own dealerships.At dealerships before the lease policy changed, one of the people familiar with Tesla's retail operations said, customers sometimes asked why used prices were so similar to those of some new models. Salespeople would cite the software upgrades to those interested in buying. For those seeking leases, they continued saying the cars would be used for robotaxis at lease-end. The explanation never changed, the person added, because until November the company never deviated from it. Marshall Distel, a transportation planner from Vermont who leased a Model 3 in 2023, said he understood from researching Tesla's policies that he would have to return the car. At the time, he said, he thought a buyout option would have been nice.Now, he has no interest in buying anything from Musk, whose high-profile activities as an advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump have alienated some consumers. ""I love the car, I just don't like what has been going on at the top with the CEO,"" Distel said. ""I don't want to be associated with that any more.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0WF:0-musk-took-leased-cars-back-so-tesla-could-use-them-as-robotaxis-instead-tesla-sold-them/"

Correction to CATL Goes Public in Hong Kong. The Tesla Battery Supplier Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs. — Barrons.com,1747747680000,"Al RootShares of electric-vehicle-battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at HKD$263 apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750."" The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It's stepping on the gas while Honda is hitting the break.Tuesday, Honda announced plans to ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend 10 trillion Yen, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by 3 trillion Yen, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda stock was up 0.8% in overseas trading, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were flat.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach while also pleased the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It's also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Stock Is Falling. Options Activity Is Off the Chart. — Barrons.com,1747302300000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling early Thursday.Shares are still having an incredible week and stock options activity might have helped.Stock in the electric-vehicle maker was 3.4% down at $336.01 in the premarket, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 0.6% and 0.4% lower, respectively.Coming into Thursday trading, Tesla stock was up more than $49, or almost 17%, for the week. Bullish comments from long-term Tesla shareholder Ron Baron, the approaching June launch date for Tesla's planned robo-taxi service, and a potential new lower-priced vehicle are reasons investors might be feeling better.The better mood isn't only reflected in the stock price. It is also expressed in put and call stock options activity.Call options give the holder the right to buy a stock at a fixed price in the future. Holding a call option is a leveraged bet that the share price will rise. The right to buy Tesla stock at $340 in mid-May was worth about $6 on Tuesday. It was worth about $12 on Wednesday, up about 100%. Holding a put option is the opposite, giving the holder the right to sell a stock at a fixed price in the future.Sometimes, options activity can create a feedback loop. Sellers of call options don't always want to take on the risk of a rising stock price. They want to make a commission for selling an option contract. If that's the case, they have to buy shares of Tesla to hedge their exposure.That feedback loop can help explain some short-term moves in Tesla stock. On Wednesday, the five most active call option contracts traded about 533,000 contracts, according to Nasdaq. The five most active put options contrast traded about 251,000 contracts. The put-to-call ratio was o.47. A typical put-to-call ratio is a little less than one.A ratio below 0.5 can also mean more stock buying to hedge call option sales than stock selling to hedge put option sales. More buying than selling pushes the price of anything higher — including Tesla stock.Over time, stock prices, of course, reflect earnings and growth. Over the short term, stock option activity can play a role in stock moves. Whatever the exact reason Tesla stock has risen so much, so quickly, the process is something to behold.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Subsequent to quarter-end, we added a second U.S. property with the acquisition of a Rivian automotive property located in Tampa, Florida,"" said Milton Lamb, CEO of Automotive Properties REIT. ""These acquisitions are consistent with our strategy of acquiring attractive commercial properties in growing metropolitan markets, and enhancing our tenant and geographic diversification, and also increases our exposure to the electric vehicle and service market in North America.""""For the quarter, we generated growth in key financial performance metrics, including AFFO per unit, reflecting our property acquisitions in the fourth quarter last year and the fixed and CPI-linked contractual rent increases embedded in our leases,"" continued Mr. Lamb. ""Looking ahead, we remain focused on strengthening our financial performance through both organic rental growth and property acquisitions that continue to drive increases in AFFO per Unit.""Q1 2025 Highlights- The REIT generated AFFO per Unit1 of $0.247 (diluted) and paid regular cash distributions of $0.201 per Unit (as defined below) in Q1 2025, representing an AFFO payout ratio1 of approximately 81.4%. For the comparable three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (""Q1 2024""), the REIT generated AFFO per Unit of $0.234 (diluted) and paid cash distributions of $0.201 per Unit, representing an AFFO payout ratio of approximately 85.9%. - The REIT had a Debt to Gross Book Value (""Debt to GBV"")2 ratio of 43.8% as at March 31, 2025, and $55.4 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facilities, $0.1 million of cash on hand, and four unencumbered properties with an aggregate value of approximately $69.4 million. As at the date of this news release, the REIT has approximately $39.4 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facilities, cash on hand of $0.1 million, and five unencumbered properties with an aggregate value of approximately $88.0 million. - On March 11, 2025, the REIT completed the acquisition of a Tesla-tenanted collision center property (the ""Columbus Tesla Property"") located in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, for a purchase price of approximately US$17.8 million plus acquisition costs of approximately US$0.8 million (total of approximately C$26.7 million). The REIT funded the purchase price for the acquisition of the Columbus Tesla Property primarily by drawing on its revolving credit facilities. Subsequent Event- On April 11, 2025, the REIT completed the acquisition of a Rivian-tenanted automotive property in Tampa, Florida (the ""Tampa Property"") for a purchase price of approximately US$13.5 million (approximately C$18.8 million).

Financial Results SummaryRental revenue in Q1 2025 increased by 2.1% to $23.9 million, compared to $23.4 million in Q1 2024. The increase in rental revenue reflects growth from properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024 and contractual annual rent increases, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the automotive dealership property located at 8210 and 8220 Kennedy Road and 7 and 13/15 Main Street, in Markham, Ontario (collectively, the ""Kennedy Lands"") in October 2024.The REIT generated total Cash NOI of $20.0 million in Q1 2025, representing an increase of 2.6% compared to Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024 and contractual rent increases, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands. Same Property Cash NOI was $19.5 million in Q1 2025, representing an increase of 2.2% compared to Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to contractual rent increases.The REIT recorded net income and other comprehensive income of $7.6 million in Q1 2025, compared to $20.9 million in Q1 2024. The decrease was primarily due to changes in non-cash fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and foreign exchange foreign contract, investment properties and DUs, IDUs, PDUs and RDUs (collectively ""Unit-based compensation"") in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024, as well as a fair value adjustment to Class B LP Units in Q1 2024. The impact of the movement in the traded value of the REIT Units resulted in an increase in fair value adjustment for Unit-based compensation of $0.8 million in Q1 2025. In Q1 2024, the impact of the movement in the traded value of the REIT units resulted in an increase in fair value adjustment for Class B LP Units and Unit-based compensation of $5.0 million.FFO in Q1 2025 increased 4.1% to $12.6 million, or $0.251 per Unit (diluted), compared to $12.1 million, or $0.241 per Unit (diluted), in Q1 2024. The increase in FFO was primarily attributable to higher rental revenue and lower interest expense, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands.AFFO in Q1 2025 increased 6.0% to $12.4 million, or $0.247 per Unit (diluted), compared to $11.7 million, or $0.234 per Unit (diluted), in Q1 2024. The increase in AFFO reflected the impact of the properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024, contractual rent increases and lower interest costs, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands. Straight-line rent adjustment is excluded from the calculation of AFFO.Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations (""ACFO"")[3] for Q1 2025 was $14.1 million, compared to $12.4 million in Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024 and contractual rent increases, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands._________________

For Q1 2025, the REIT declared and paid regular cash distributions of $9.87 million, or $0.201 per Unit, representing an AFFO payout ratio of 81.4%. The AFFO payout ratio was lower in Q1 2025 compared to the 85.9% AFFO payout ratio in Q1 2024, primarily due to the positive impact of the properties acquired subsequent to Q1 2024, contractual rent increases and lower interest costs, partially offset by the reduction of rent from the sale of the Kennedy Lands.

CATL Goes Public in Hong Kong. The Tesla Battery Supplier Stock Is Surging While Honda Cuts Back on EVs. — Barrons.com,1747746060000,"Al RootShares of electric-vehicle-battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and Honda Motor both rose after making decisions about vehicle electrification that seem to point in opposite directions.For starters, CATL stock jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Thursday. The company raised about $4.6 billion, selling 135.6 million shares at HKD$263 apiece.The Chinese company was already publicly traded in China, trading under the code ""300750."" The Hong Kong stock symbol is ""3750."" The Hong Kong jump values CATL at about $175 billion, 8% higher than stock prices in China imply. That gap should close over the coming days as traders with access to both markets arbitrage it away.The money will help CATL, the world's largest maker of EV batteries, with a global market share approaching 30%, expand in Europe. It's stepping on the gas while Honda is hitting the break.Tuesday, Honda announced plans to ""realign [its] automobile business strategy to address [the] current business environment."" EV sales just aren't growing as expected outside of China, where they make up roughly one-third of all new car purchases.In 2024, Honda believed EVs and fuel-cell-powered vehicles would account for about 40% of total sales by 2030. That implied sales of about 2 million EVs annually by the end of the decade. It was prepared to spend 10 trillion Yen, or $69 billion, over 10 years to make that happen.Now, ""the environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day,"" the company said in a news release. ""Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of [the] EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations, which had been the premise for the widespread adoption of EVs, as well as changes in trade policies of various countries.""Honda expects EVs to account for less than 30% of new-car sales by 2030. It will reduce EV spending by 3 trillion Yen, or almost $21 billion.Investors reacted positively to the cut. Honda stock was up 0.8% in overseas trading, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were flat.Both stocks are up while making decisions that appear at odds with one another. It might boil down to the idea that EV demand is still growing globally, just not as fast as expected. Investors appear pleased that Honda is taking a cautious approach while also pleased the global battery leader continues to invest for growth.It's also possible that CATL and Honda investors think differently about the future.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"In Tesla’s wake, more big companies propose voting 'Dexit' to depart Delaware",1747261393000,"In the coming weeks, investors in nine public companies worth at least $1 billion each will vote on proposals to ditch Delaware as their place of incorporation, potentially denting the state's longtime reputation as Corporate America's capital, Reuters has found.Five companies with a stock market value of at least $1 billion have moved their legal home out of Delaware since last year, in what some have nicknamed ""Dexit."" Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA made a high-profile move to Texas last year and in April, President Donald Trump’s social media company Trump Media & Technology NASDAQ:DJT , which owns the Truth Social platform, decamped to Florida.Most of the companies are dominated by a significant shareholder or founder. Delaware judges have expanded the court's most stringent legal standard to a growing range of situations involving controllers, increasing the risk of shareholder lawsuits. The decisions culminated with the blockbuster ruling last year that rescinded Musk’s $56 billion pay package from Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA .Less than an hour after the ruling, Musk said on X: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.”Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla soon reincorporated in Texas. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Trump Media, which is controlled by a trust that owns shares on behalf of President Trump and is overseen by his oldest son, said in its March proxy statement that Delaware's ""increasingly litigious environment facing corporations with controlling stockholders has created unpredictability in decision-making.” The company cited the Musk pay ruling as an example. It is now incorporated in Florida. Dropbox NASDAQ:DBX and The Trade Desk NASDAQ:TTD , which each has a large shareholder, and Cannae Holdings NYSE:CNNE have moved their charter to Nevada from Delaware. They did not respond to a request for comment. Among the companies set to vote on proposals to leave are Simon Property Group NYSE:SPG , which is seeking shareholder approval on Wednesday to reincorporate in Indiana, and gaming platform Roblox NYSE:RBLX , which wants to move to Nevada. Unlike many of the other companies that have proposed a ""Dexit,"" Simon does not have a controlling shareholder. It declined to comment on its reasons for proposing a move, referring to its latest proxy statement. Roblox said that Nevada law provides greater predictability. To be sure, the share of Delaware-based companies in the Russell 3000 index, which covers nearly all public companies, continues to grow, rising to 62% last year from 56% in 2020, according to ISS-Corporate. However, 2024 was the first year that more companies in the Russell Index left Delaware than moved their incorporation to the state. “On the Richter scale, it’s not that high,” said Benjamin Edwards, a professor at the UNLV School of Law, of the changes. “But it’s still shaking the ground.”FEARING AN EXODUSDelaware, which has no sales tax, gets around a third of its general budget revenue from fees and taxes related to chartering businesses. Fearing an exodus of companies leaving after the judicial rulings, the state enacted legislation in March that limits the role of the state’s judges in reviewing certain corporate deals.It also limited the scope of so-called ""books and records"" requests, a legal tool often used by shareholder attorneys to try to obtain directors' emails and texts.Despite the recent changes, corporate law in Delaware remains relatively strict when it comes to insiders making deals that would likely benefit them directly, such as a deal to buy assets from a controlling shareholder or Musk and his Tesla pay arrangement, legal experts said. ""That's one area where Delaware has consistently said, 'Look, we're going to kick the tires of those decisions with a little bit extra force',"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.Delaware law typically requires a company that strikes a deal with a controlling shareholder to prove the arrangement met a strict standard showing the price and process were fair, unless it was negotiated by independent directors or approved by shareholders. In Nevada, the same controlling shareholder deal would likely be protected by a legal standard known as the business judgment rule, which shields against lawsuits, regardless of how it was negotiated and approved, legal experts said. Talley said Nevada directors are protected unless they engage in fraud. ""It's actually okay to engage in self-dealing, as long as you don't lie about it,"" he said.A state's corporate law governs a company's relationship with shareholders and typically does not affect legal rights of employees or consumers. In Texas, where Tesla and SpaceX are now incorporated, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law on Wednesday amendments to its corporate code that are aimed at reducing the threat of shareholder litigation, in part by allowing companies to set stock ownership thresholds for lawsuits. The plaintiff in the Musk pay case owned just nine shares when he filed suit in 2018.The Texas law is effective immediately. Eric Lentell, the general counsel at Delaware-chartered Archer Aviation NYSE:ACHR , said the aircraft developer is considering reincorporating in Texas and believes directors of other public companies should reconsider Delaware. After a Delaware judge refused last year to recognize a vote by Tesla investors to reinstate Musk's pay, Lentell said it signaled that Delaware judges “have become kind of activist in nature"" by appearing to rewrite settled law. “I think that’s where people get nervous,” he said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RM0XR:0-in-tesla-s-wake-more-big-companies-propose-voting-dexit-to-depart-delaware/"

Lockheed Stock Just Dropped $12. This Is Why. — Barrons.com,1747255140000,"Al RootLockheed Martin stock dropped about $12 in the blink of an eye on Wednesday.Midday, the defense contractor's shares sunk to $447.20 from $459.40. Management comments at a BofA Securities investor conference looked like the best reason.Lockheed CFO Evan Scott presented and said there could be delays for the F-35 production lot 18 award from the U.S. Defense Department. The F-35 is the company's advanced fighter jet — the Pentagon awarded a Lot 18 contract in December worth $11.8 billion for 145 jets.Scott said Wednesday that lots 18 and 19 could be combined into a single award.""On the plus side, that accelerates...roughly 150 jets of backlog potentially into the second quarter. However, the overall award now is probably going to happen later in the second quarter than if Lot 18 had been a standalone,"" he said.That delay could pressure second-quarter estimates, something investors might not like. What's more, the company is seeing cost pressures in some of its classified programs.Lockheed stock came off its lows for the day, but still ended the session 1.9% lower at $451. In comparison, the S&P 500 was flat, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%.Coming into Wednesday trading, Lockheed had fallen about 16% since the Nov. 5 presidential election. Criticism from Trump advisor and Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the F-35 has weighed on investor sentiment.

Wall Street Loves China's Battery Beast--Even the Pentagon Can't Stop It,1747743395000,"Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd (CATL) just pulled off the biggest listing of the yearand did it with style. The Chinese battery leader's shares jumped 16% in their Hong Kong debut after raising $4.6 billion, a number that could climb to $5.3 billion with full allotment. The offering attracted massive interest from both institutional and retail investors, despite CATL being blacklisted by the Pentagon earlier this yeara move the company continues to deny relevance to. The stock opened at HK$263 and closed well above that, even trading higher than its Shenzhen counterparta rare feat for dual-listed Chinese names.CATL, the dominant force behind 38% of the global EV battery market, supplies Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , Volkswagen, Ford, and others. It's also stepping on the gas with new tech: batteries that can deliver over 500km of range in just five minutes of charging and up to 1,500km fully charged. That kind of leap, combined with a forward earnings multiple around 17x, has some analysts seeing upside potential of up to 50%. Jefferies' Johnson Wan noted the setup was a no-brainer buy, citing solid fundamentals, global tailwinds, and a fresh $7.6 billion earmarked for overseas expansionespecially into Europe, where margins are wider and demand is climbing.Options trading volume on day one topped 34,000 contracts, the highest in a decade for Hong Kong IPOs with listed options, and sentiment leaned heavily bullish. Backed by big names like Qatar Investment Authority and Hillhouse, CATL's listing could help revive Hong Kong's IPO scene, lifting total issuance above $22 billion for the year. JPMorgan and Bank of America, despite political pushback from a U.S. congressional committee, stayed on the dealsignaling confidence in CATL's growth story. Chairman Robin Zeng called the listing a milestone in its push for a zero-carbon future, while the broader market seems to agree: investors want in, and they're willing to look past the noise to bet on the next leg of the global EV race.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:36a2c0669094b:0-wall-street-loves-china-s-battery-beast-even-the-pentagon-can-t-stop-it/
Ford and Tesla Are Best-Positioned for Trump's Car Tariffs. These Companies Are the Worst. — Barrons.com,1747254480000,"By Al RootWith more tariff certainty, investors — with some help from Wall Street — can better assess the impact levies have on auto makers and new-car demand.The impact is still significant. The U.S. domestic industry, however, might be in better shape than investors suspect. Tesla is in the best position of any car company, followed by Ford Motor. German auto makers have the biggest problem.In late April, after heavy lobbying by the industry, President Donald Trump modified his auto tariff policies. There is still a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, but there was some relief on imported parts. What's more, auto tariffs don't stack on top of other tariffs related to fentanyl, steel, aluminum, or other factors.As a result of the changes, Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow cut his estimate for per-car tariff impacts from an average of more than $6,000 per vehicle to a little more than $3,000. That increase is about 6% of the average car price. That doesn't mean car prices will rise by 6%, though. Suppliers and auto makers will absorb some of the impacts.The per-unit cost varies widely by model and by auto maker. Cost increases can be as high as 17% for some models and as low as zero.Overall, Jewsikow projects zero cost increases for Tesla. It manufactures all the cars it sells domestically, and the parts credits should be enough to mitigate tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant parts. Ford and General Motors are expected to see per-unit cost increases of $1,277 and $1,866, respectively.Ford imports about 20% of its volume. GM imports closer to 40%. Stellantis and Honda Motor also have average impacts of less than $2,000 per vehicle. German auto makers will see the most significant impact. Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group face per-unit cost headwinds of $5,941, $8,237, and $11,894, respectively.""We were surprised by the limited tariffs projected for Stellantis and Honda, and the magnitude of tariff costs on a per-unit basis for certain import brands, particularly the large luxury brands,"" Jewsikow wrote in a Wednesday report.Stellantis suspended its guidance for 2025. Honda offered guidance for its fiscal year 2026 on May 13. It expects to make an operating profit of about $3.4 billion, down from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. Included in the guidance is a $3.6 billion headwind in the company's automotive business.The impact on domestic auto makers looks to be manageable. Still, higher costs will result in almost one million fewer cars sold in 2025, Jewsikow adds. He forecasts just under 15 million new cars sold in the U.S. this year, down from a prior forecast of about 15.5 million and down from about 16 million sold in 2024.Exactly which companies will lose volume is hard to say. It's likely to be auto makers facing steeper cost increases, which would be another positive for domestic auto makers.As of Wednesday's close, shares of Ford are flat since the Nov. 5 presidential election, while the S&P 500 is up about 2%. GM and Stellantis shares are down 6% and 22%, respectively.News other than tariffs can move stock prices, but the declines for GM and Stellantis might be a little overdone, given Guggenhiem's insights.Tesla stock has gained 38% since the election, but a lot more than tariffs move shares of Elon Musk's car company.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

General Motors Urges Lawmakers to Block EV Mandate as EV Demand Slows,1747743240000,"General Motors Company GM is urging lawmakers to block California’s strict zero-emission vehicle mandate, signaling a significant reversal in the automaker’s stance as demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States begins to slow, per the Wall Street Journal.Per an internal email sent by GM to thousands of salaried employees last week, emissions regulations that are not aligned with market conditions threaten the company’s business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable.Once a supporter of California’s plan to phase out gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035, GM is now lobbying against it. The company is encouraging employees to contact Senators to revoke California’s waiver, which permits the state to enforce stricter emissions rules. These rules have been adopted by 11 other states. GM had previously aligned its EV strategy with California's goals, but declining EV demand and market pressures have prompted a strategic shift. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .California aims for 35% of all new vehicle sales to be electric or plug-in hybrid (PHEV) by 2026. However, in the first quarter, EVs accounted for 20.8% of sales and PHEVs 3.7%, totaling 24.5%, which is roughly 10 percentage points below the target and slightly down from the previous quarter.As EV sales fall short of projections, major automakers like GM and Ford Motor Company F are scaling back their EV initiatives. GM has abandoned its plan to produce 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and postponed several key launches as consumers prefer more affordable options and federal tax incentives face potential rollbacks.In the first four months of 2025, Ford’s EV sales declined 2.9% year over year to 27,409 units. Also, the company's Model e segment, which features all-electric models, continues to struggle amid stiff competition, pricing pressure and significant costs associated with new-generation EV development. After having incurred losses of $4.7 billion in its EV business in 2023, Ford’s loss from Model e widened to $5.07 billion in 2024, exacerbated by ongoing pricing pressure and increased investments in next-generation EVs. The company is expected to incur huge losses in its EV business this year as well. Another auto giant, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, is also struggling with falling demand for EVs. In the first quarter, Tesla deliveries fell 13% year over year to 336,681 units. Automotive margins are also on the decline amid falling volumes and generous discount offers. The metric came in at 11.3% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 15.5% reported in the corresponding quarter of 2024. This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c8c334c74094b:0-general-motors-urges-lawmakers-to-block-ev-mandate-as-ev-demand-slows/
Tesla Stock Rose. Why the Shares Are on a Great Run. — Barrons.com,1747253760000,"Al RootTesla stock jumped again on Wednesday as investors looked to the future.Shares of the electric-vehicle maker added 4.1%, closing at $347.60 apiece, while the S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%.News about potential compensation for CEO Elon Musk might be helping. Tesla's board is looking into a new pay package for Musk, the Financial Times reported recently.He was notably awarded some 300 million incentive-laden options in 2018, but that pay package is being contested in Delaware courts. The options are worth roughly $90 billion at current prices for Tesla shares.Any new pay package would likely be hefty, but most investors want to keep Musk around. Tesla didn't respond to Barron's request for comment.Tesla hasn't scheduled its annual meeting of shareholders yet. An annual proxy statement and annual meeting would be a good time to sort out pay details.The early rise on Tuesday adds to an incredible month for the stock. The shares closed at $334.07 on Tuesday, the highest close since February, leaving shares up more than 18% in May. Shares were also up 40% since Tesla reported its first-quarter results on April 22.Those results were relatively weak: Tesla's operating profits missed estimates as deliveries fell 13% year over year. But CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more time at Tesla and less time in Washington, D.C.Figuring out exactly where Musk is spending his time is hard to do. He was in Saudi Arabia with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, along with other U.S. business leaders.He also said Tesla would launch a self-driving robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June — on schedule.That was good news. Investors are very focused on autonomous vehicles. Baron Capital founder and Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said Tuesday that autonomy can expand Tesla's profits dramatically.Tesla management also believes that self-driving Teslas, and new models, can help repair some of the recent challenges for the brand. ""Our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to be a winner,"" said CFO Vaibhav Taneja on the company's first-quarter conference call. Tesla plans to launch a lower-priced model mid-year. ""Additionally, the advancement in FSD-related features, including pilot robotaxi launch in Austin later this year, should help create a new era of demand.""New models, self-driving cars, and improving brand image is the bull case for Tesla stock.

Tesla Stock Drops. The 'Big Beautiful Bill' Is Big Trouble and There's Another Vote to Watch. — Barrons.com,1747917900000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling in early trading Thursday after the House of Representatives passed its tax-and-spend bill. And its not the only vote that matters Thursday.Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were off 1.9% at $328.39, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.The House passed its budget bill on Thursday, and it included measures that would require owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to pay $250 and $100 annual fees, respectively. It also terminated credits on most clean energy initiatives, including those for new and used electric vehicles. None of that is good Tesla.But there is another vote coming Thursday, this one in the Senate, which is voting on a Congressional Review Act measure Thursday designed to essentially eliminate a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency that lets California regulate its air emissions.The CRA can be used to overturn federal agency actions.It's a controversial step. For starters, California has been regulating its air quality since the late 1960s. And Republicans have maneuvered around Senate filibuster rules. Democrats aren't happy with the strategy. ""The Republican plan would backfire,"" said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, in a news release. ""Partisan actions cut both ways."" Democrats could do the same thing to federal rules favored by Republicans down the road.However the vote turns out, it appears to be just one step in a lengthy fight over California emissions. California has fought to keep its ability to regulate air emissions in the past.The Senate vote isn't the first salvo from the Republican-controlled Congress. Earlier in May, House lawmakers voted to nullify the "" waiver of preemption"" for California's "" Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations, which the Environmental Protection Agency had posted in January.Advanced Clean Cars II currently requires roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in California — and several other states that have adopted California standards — to be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of California's new car sales today. EVs are only about 7% to 8% of nationwide new car sales.Changes could be a problem for Tesla because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.Tesla stock, so far, has been relatively immune to the California air quality news. Coming into Thursday trading, shares were up almost 19% in May.One explanation for the move is AI. Investors are thinking more about the company's plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. The success of that business depends more on Tesla's AI-trained self-driving software than its electric motors and batteries.Tesla investors might also realize there is still a long way to go to overturn the California system fully.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"High-Yield ETFs: Big Payouts, Bigger Trade-Offs?",1747743240000,"While a significant amount of money continues to flow into low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs, the ETF universe is becoming increasingly complex. Most new ETFs being launched are actively managed, and many make use of derivatives.Two recent regulatory changes—the “ETF Rule” and the “Derivatives Rule”—have made it easier for providers to launch ETFs and incorporate derivatives into their strategies. The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking.Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories:Buffer or defined outcome ETFsLeveraged or inverse single-stock ETFsOption-based income ETFsSome of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs. (See: Buffer ETFs Attract Billions as Investors Seek Shelter from Market Turmoil)This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields—among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts.We analyzed the performance of 24 single-stock covered call ETFs in the YieldMax suite from their respective inception dates. We focused on YieldMax because it is the clear leader in this niche, significantly ahead of competitors despite a recent surge in similar offerings.Many of YieldMax’s ETFs launched in 2023—providing a limited, yet more substantial, performance history compared to most rivals, which are even newer.Despite their eye-popping distribution rates, these products tend to underperform on a total return basis due to steep declines in share price. Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, only two managed to slightly outperform their respective underlying stocks.Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy WorksYieldMax currently offers 48 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of over $10 billion. Though relatively new—the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022—the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market.According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap.These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income.To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%–15% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spread strategies to further enhance yields.The YieldMax Reddit community has around 44,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income.The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums—and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM.Yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly payout and dividing it by the fund’s latest NAV. However, yields can vary significantly from month to month as income from selling options depends on fluctuations in the underlying stock, implied volatility, and other factors.Performance Since InceptionWe analyzed the total return—including distributions—of 24 YieldMax single-stock ETFs from their inception versus their respective underlying stocks. Some stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat—but in all cases except those tracking PayPal PYPL and Marathon Digital MARA, the ETF underperformed the stock.For the four most popular products, the performance gap was substantial—showing that investors may be leaving a lot of money on the table in pursuit of yield.YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY )The most popular product in the suite celebrated its one-year anniversary in February and now boasts $4 billion in assets. It is also the highest-yielding single-stock ETF in the lineup, offering a distribution rate of 136%. Since inception, it has delivered a total return of 286%, while MSTR stock has surged 457% during the same period.Once a little-known, money-losing software firm, Strategy MSTR has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and now trades like a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. Its stock commands a significant premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings.Some experts believe the financial engineering behind MSTY—and the premium valuation—may be unsustainable. If you're bullish on bitcoin, why not consider the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which charges just 0.25% and closely tracks the price of the asset?TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY)The oldest product in the suite holds $1.2 billion in assets. Since its debut in November 2022, the ETF has gained approximately 22%—significantly underperforming Tesla TSLA shares, which are up about 102% over the same period. It has also lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, which have gained 53% and 85%, respectively.For context, low-cost index funds like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM charge just 0.02% and 0.15% in fees, while most option income products charge close to 1%. TSLY currently boasts a striking yield of nearly 107%.NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY )The second most popular product in the family has generated a total return of about 187% since its inception in May 2023. However, shares of the AI darling NVIDIA NVDA have risen approximately 372% over the same period. Still, the ETF has attracted $1.3 billion in assets.YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY )CONY, which tracks Coinbase COIN—a major beneficiary of bitcoin’s rise—has returned 120% since its debut in August 2023. Over the same period, COIN stock has gained about 209%. The ETF currently sports a yield of 97% and has about $1.1 billion in assets.Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFsThese ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price. In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if the stock falls—creating an asymmetric risk-reward profile.By contrast, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI—which helped launch the covered call trend—uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of about 125 stocks. (Read: What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?)The fund then sells out-of-the-money S&P 500 index call options to generate monthly income. This portfolio doesn’t experience the outsized moves seen in names like Strategy or Coinbase, which explains why the performance shortfall may not be too striking.Bottom LineYou should only invest in a fund tied to a single stock if you're bullish on that specific name—in which case, you're generally better off owning the stock directly. If you expect the stock to decline, it’s best to steer clear of any product linked to it.These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound. However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don’t expect jumbo distributions.If you’re drawn to high monthly income and can accept an asymmetric risk-reward profile—as well as potentially unfavorable and inconsistent tax treatment—these funds may still appeal to you.ETFs have democratized access to markets, and innovation in the space has been remarkable. But with complex products like these, it’s essential for investors to fully understand how they work—and what outcomes are realistic.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ab88debad094b:0-high-yield-etfs-big-payouts-bigger-trade-offs/

BEV registrations surged 28% in April from last year, largely driven by Chinese car brands.Despite the EU's imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, registrations of such cars increased 59% in the month from a year earlier, while carmakers from Europe, Japan, South Korea and the United States recorded 26% growth. WEAK TESLA DEMANDThe company reported its first drop in annual deliveries last year, and analysts expect another fall this year after a 13% decline in the first quarter.Musk said earlier this week that Tesla had already turned around sales, and demand was strong in regions apart from Europe. His political views have triggered waves of protests against Tesla in the U.S. and Europe, leading to a slump in sales.Additionally, production halts to retool factories to make the redesigned Model Y crossover globally caused a drop in manufacturing and sales in the first quarter.Analysts have also attributed lower sales to customers waiting for less-expensive versions of the new Model Y, Tesla's best-selling vehicle, to become more widely available.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RU0QZ:0-china-s-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time-report-says/"

Tesla Sets Record With $139 Million Pay Package for Finance Chief — WSJ,1747733400000,"By Theo FrancisElon Musk isn't the only Tesla executive rewriting the compensation playbook. The electric carmaker's finance chief, Vaibhav Taneja, received a pay package of $139 million last year.That's more than most CEOs and the highest amount paid to a chief financial officer since modern reporting began in 2006, according to Equilar. It eclipses the $86 million package that hydrogen-truck maker Nikola gave its then-CFO in 2020. Nikola filed for bankruptcy this year.Taneja's compensation was tied to stock options and equity awards he received in October 2024 that recognized his promotion to CFO in August 2023. The 47-year-old has held other financial roles at Tesla since 2017.Taneja's boss, meanwhile, is still working without a paycheck. Tesla's board has formed a special committee to review Musk's compensation. His pay has been tied up in legal fights since a multibillion stock grant was thrown out by a court. Tesla has appealed that decision.Tesla's shares were trading near $250 at the time of Taneja's equity award, which vests — or becomes fully Taneja's property to sell or exercise — over four years. They closed around $342 on Monday.The award came during a period of mixed results for Tesla. While the stock soared toward the end of the year following the election of President Trump, global vehicle deliveries fell for the first time in more than a decade. In the first quarter, deliveries fell 13% and net profit fell 71%.Tesla and Taneja didn't respond to requests for comment. In an April 30 regulatory filing discussing the award, Tesla said it reviewed its compensation to reflect individual performance and retention in light of current equity awards.Write to Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250520002575:0/

Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said Wednesday at the New York Fed's Annual Conference of Second District Directors and Advisors that monetary policy is in a good position to deal with the possible inflation impacts of the Trump Administration's tariff plans. ""If the increases in tariffs announced so far are sustained, they are likely to interrupt progress on disinflation and generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,"" Jefferson said. ""Whether tariffs create persistent upward pressure on inflation will depend on how trade policy is implemented, the pass-through to consumer prices, the reaction of supply chains, and the performance of the economy.""Most US Treasury yields advanced intraday, with the 10-year up 2.7 basis points to 4.53% and the two-year rate higher by 3.8 basis points to 4.06%.

EV Owners Face Annual Fee Under Proposed Tax Bill — Barrons.com,1747868640000,"Al RootThe latest version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill includes another hit to the electric vehicle industry.The legislation includes a provision for the Federal Highway Administration to impose a $250 annual fee on all-electric vehicles and a $100 yearly fee for hybrid vehicles.The FHA helps build and maintain roads — and gets most of its money from gasoline taxes. With all-electric cars using no gas, EV drivers get (small) free lunch paid for by drivers of gas-guzzling vehicles.The free lunch might be less than drivers of gasoline-powered cars would guess, though. Already, 37 states collect annual EV fees ranging from $50 to $250 a year. The average is about $142, according to Atlas Public Policy. Some other states collect fees at public charging stations.As for traditional cars, the amount an average driver might contribute to the FHA's Highway Trust Fund is probably about $100 annually. The new law might seem a little punitive toward EVs, but EVs are a little heavier than gasoline-powered vehicles. More weight can equal more wear and tear on the roads.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents many auto makers in Washington, including General Motors and Ford Motor, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla, which isn't a part of the AAI, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The latest version of the bill also ends the $7,500 purchase tax credit for qualifying electric vehicles.And earlier this month, the House voted to strip California's ability to regulate its air quality. The House resolution would need Senate approval and the president's signature to become law.That legislation could be a problem because California regulations form the basis for much of Tesla's zero-emission vehicle credit sales, which have generated about $2.9 billion over the past 12 months.California is currently requiring that roughly two-thirds of all vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2030. That's a tall order, with EVs accounting for about 20% of new car sales today. The AAI supports a slackening of California EV regulation.Electric vehicles appear to be losing policy support on multiple fronts. The annual highway levy is likely the least of the industry's concerns.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

US Defense Secretary Hegseth meets Musk for second time at Pentagon,1747866002000,"U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met billionaire Elon Musk at the Pentagon on Wednesday, officials said, the second known time the close ally of President Donald Trump has visited the department's headquarters. In March, Musk, whose businesses have a number of Defense Department contracts, was granted an unprecedented top-level meeting at the Pentagon. ""The Secretary met with Elon Musk and other members of the X AI team this morning,"" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. ""The Department of Defense is committed to engaging with AI industry CEOs to ensure our warfighters are equipped to face 21st century threats,"" Parnell added. The meeting was first reported by Reuters.Earlier on Wednesday, Hegseth's pastor, Brooks Potteiger, had said on X: ""It's not everyday you walk past Elon Musk en route to preach."" Potteiger spoke at a Christian prayer service at the Pentagon on Wednesday.Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ahead of his first meeting in March, there was a media report that Musk would be briefed on secret war plans for China, something Musk, Trump and others denied. Musk, at the time, called the report ""pure propaganda"" and urged legal action against leakers. Musk's businesses Starlink and SpaceX already have a number of Pentagon contracts, raising questions about conflicts of interest as he advocates for innovation and re-prioritization of Pentagon spending to find efficiencies. Trump's planned Golden Dome missile defense shield, which would require hundreds of sensors and other satellites to keep watch for incoming ballistic missiles, would be a natural fit for SpaceX and its Starlink unit. The opportunities for his companies, SpaceX in particular, under Trump could drive billions of dollars of revenue to his firms. The White House has previously said Musk will recuse himself if any conflicts of interest arise between his business dealings and his role in cutting federal government spending. Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has made cuts across the U.S. government, including at the Pentagon.Musk said on Tuesday he will cut his political spending substantially, the latest public signal that he is shifting his attention back to his business empire amid growing investor concerns.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RT115:0-us-defense-secretary-hegseth-meets-musk-for-second-time-at-pentagon/"
US expected to declare Biden fuel economy rules exceeded legal authority,1747698772000,"The U.S. Transportation Department is expected to declare that fuel economy rules issued under then President Joe Biden exceeded the government's legal authority by including electric vehicles in setting the rules, automaker officials said Monday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday submitted its interpretive rule, ""Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program"" to the White House for review.The prior administration had ""illegally used CAFE standards as a backdoor electric vehicle mandate – driving the price of cars up,"" he said in a statement.Removing EVs from the calculations for credits and the regulatory mandates could result in lower overall fuel economy requirements.NHTSA in June said it would hike CAFE requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 liters per 100 km) by 2031 from 39.1 mpg currently for light-duty vehicles.Last year, 120 Republican lawmakers said NHTSA exceeded its authority by adopting fuel economy standards ""that effectively mandate EVs while at the same time force the internal combustion engine out of the market.""The lawmakers said the agency ""accounted for EVs in its regulatory baseline and factored that baseline into its determination of the maximum achievable CAFE standards.""House Republicans last week proposed killing the EV tax credit and repealing fuel efficiency rules designed to prod automakers into building more zero-emission vehicles as part of a broad-based tax reform bill.Federal law requires NHTSA to set CAFE standards at the maximum feasible level.The Environmental Protection Agency said it was beginning the effort to reverse the Biden administration's parallel vehicle emissions rules that would force automakers to build a rising number of EVs but has not begun any effort to rescind California's legal authority for its 2035 EV rules. EPA is also reconsidering rules awarding credits for ""start-stop"" technology, which is in around half of new vehicles.NHTSA said last year the rule would reduce gasoline consumption by 64 billion gallons and cut emissions by 659 million metric tons.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RR143:0-us-expected-to-declare-biden-fuel-economy-rules-exceeded-legal-authority/"

Uber Stock Is Dropping. Blame Elon Musk and Tesla. — Barrons.com,1747861560000,"Al RootUber Technologies stock fell Wednesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he didn't need to buy the ride-hailing company. Wait. Was that on the table?Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday afternoon in Austin, Texas, where Tesla plans to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in June. Faber asked why Tesla doesn't buy Uber to give its business an immediate boost.""There's no need,"" answered Musk.Uber has created a digital platform to manage demand for rides and the supply of drivers. Musk says Tesla can develop an app of its own. What is more, ""we have millions of cars that will be able to operate autonomously,"" he said.Musk is referring to Tesla vehicles owned by regular car drivers, which will be able to operate autonomously when Tesla's full self-driving software gets good enough. He envisions Tesla owners renting out their vehicles to Tesla to make money when they aren't using them. It would be like Airbnb, but for cars.Uber stock lost 3.5%, closing at $88.67, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The effects of autonomous-driving technology have been debated for months. Fear about self-driving cars, and how they might affect companies such as Uber, likely reached its peak a year ago, around the time Musk announced that Tesla would host a robo-taxi event in August. The event was eventually held in October.From the end of 2023 into the summer of 2024, Uber stock declined about 5%.Still, Uber has its own self-driving strategy, announcing deals with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to Uber's networks in Austin and Atlanta. That helped calm investors' nerves. Coming into Wednesday trading, Uber stock was up about 55% from its summer 2024 lows.Investors are still waiting to see how the self-driving ride-hailing market works, but it doesn't have to be a winner-take-all market. For starters, fleets of cars are expensive. Musk believes one of Tesla's key advantages is all the car buyers who have already paid for Teslas. Having a partner like Uber could lower capital costs for Waymo, or even for Tesla.There is also something to be said for the Uber brand. ""Uber"" has essentially become the verb for using a ride-hailing service.Musk's comments might have surprised investors, a little, eliminating any small price premium reflecting the long odds of a buyout.The challenge now is to understand and assess the development of the robo-taxi market in the coming years, and then to pick winners and losers.Uber is valued at $190 billion, more than General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis combined. Tesla is valued north of $1 trillion.Exactly how much is related to robo-taxis is hard to say. Most bullish Tesla analysts say a majority of the value is due to Tesla's AI expertise, which teaches cars to drive themselves.Alphabet, which controls Waymo, is valued at $2 trillion. How much Waymo of that represents is hard to say. Most of Alphabet's money still comes from Google's search business. Still, Waymo's progress has been substantial. It completes more than 250,000 driverless rides a week and announced Tuesday it had passed 10 million fully autonomous paid rides.It is safe to say there are hundreds of billions, even trillions, of value at stake in driverless cars.

Tesla Just Made It Nearly Impossible for Small Investors to Sue The Company's Executive,1747686571000,"Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA just rewrote the rules of the gameagain. In a recent SEC filing, the company announced it will now block shareholders who own less than 3% of its stock from filing derivative lawsuits against its executives or board. That threshold? About 97 million shares, or roughly $34 billion at Friday's close. This follows Tesla's shift from Delaware to Texas incorporation, where a new law gives companies the green light to set their own barriers to such lawsuitssomething Delaware doesn't allow.The timing isn't lost on anyone. Back in 2018, Richard Tornetta filed suit over Elon Musk's massive $56 billion pay package, owning just nine shares. A Delaware judge sided with Tornetta last year, voiding the package and calling it unfair to shareholders. Musk is now appealing. But with Tesla's new bylaw in place, future Tornettas might not even get through the door. It's a preemptive shield, born in Texas, that could reshape how corporate power is challengedif it's challenged at all.For investors, this move could cut both ways. On one hand, it limits legal distractions and could streamline decision-making. On the other, it raises questions about checks and balances at one of the world's most closely watched companies. If this approach catches on with other Texas-incorporated firms, it may mark the start of a broader shiftone where only the biggest shareholders get a seat in the courtroom.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8d520adb4094b:0-tesla-just-made-it-nearly-impossible-for-small-investors-to-sue-the-company-s-executive/

Tesla Stock Drops. Its Self-Driving Cars May Not Be Self Driving After All. — Barrons.com,1747858560000,"Al RootTesla stock rose early Wednesday but couldn't hold gains, and shares sold off with the market. Still, it's been a strong May for shares. Comments Elon Musk made on Tuesday show just how important June will be for the shares.One surprise from Musk, however, is that Tesla's first self-driving taxis might not be as self-driving as investors expect.Tesla stock traded as high as $347.25 but closed at $334.62, down 2.7%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.Last week, Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber in Austin, Texas. Musk confirmed that Tesla plans to start robo-taxi service in the city by the end of June. He also indicated that there would be a small number of cars initially, humans would supervise operations, and the self-driving Teslas would only be able to go where the company was confident they could succeed.Having humans oversee and potentially intervene as tele0perators might not be exactly what investors expected for a robotaxi service, though. Musk has his reasons. ""We're going to be extremely paranoid about deployment, as we should.""""It's prudent for us to start with a small number,"" he added. That could be as low as 10. The goal is to be at a thousand in a few months and ""hundreds of thousands"" by the end of 2026. Any Tesla that has the correct hardware can become a robo-taxi when the AI-trained self-driving software gets good enough. At that point, Tesla owners can elect to use their vehicles to make money in the robo-taxi network when they aren't using their vehicles.That's the goal, anyway. Musk also reiterated his expectation that Tesla could license its technology to other auto makers. Seeing Teslas drive themselves in Austin successfully could be a catalyst for a deal.Musk also addressed self-driving technology competition with BYD. He's confident Tesla has a superior product, citing local independent testing.Earlier on Tuesday, via video at a conference in Qatar, Musk also said that he expects to be CEO in five years — and he had a lot to say. Musk said he would spend less time in Washington, D.C., in April, but anything that indicates Musk is focused on his car company is generally good for the stock.He added that he expects to reduce his political spending. The reduction can have a significant impact on 2025 midterm races,"" says Carl Tobias, Williams Chair at the University of Richmond Law School. He hopes Musk's D.C. departure will reduce or end some of the ""destructive activity"" undertaken by DOGE. Investors hope less politics can help heal any brand damage from Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration.Musk stepping back from politics and speaking positively about this company and Tesla's AI technology are to be expected. Still, it's what investors wanted to hear — now Musk needs to deliver.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent. Higher yields tend to compress valuations for growth stocks, which rely on future earnings.Read more: Adani, Tata, Vedanta make a power play for coal-fired projects after five-year lullThe downbeat session came just after markets closed out a stellar week. Investors had cheered a breakthrough in trade negotiations, with the U.S. and China agreeing to pause tariff hikes, lifting global risk appetite. The Nasdaq had rallied over 7 percent last week, while the S&P 500 gained more than 5 percent over five straight sessions. The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone. Walmart shares slipped 1.7 percent after President Trump suggested the retailer should shoulder the burden of tariffs, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said CEO Doug McMillon had agreed to absorb some levies. Netflix dropped 2 percent after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral, citing its sharp rally.

Tesla's Robotaxi Revolution: Is it Too Late to Buy the Stock?,1747842900000,"Robotaxi is a word that once was the exclusive to the world of science fiction. As it turns out, Demolition Man is about to manifest itself in reality. Elon Musk revealed that Tesla ( TSLA ) is going to begin deploying self-driving taxi cabs to the streets of the US. It’s only a matter of time before transportation as a whole is drastically changed forever. The democratization of getting from point A to point B. Henry Ford is blushing somewhere.Of course, I understand that Elon isn’t everybody’s favorite anymore. Political motivations have created diverging feelings amongst us. For those that know me, at this point you realize that I couldn’t care less about politics. In my opinion, it’s theatre, sensationalized to evoke your emotions and get you to click and share articles. Here, I want to look at the inner workings of Tesla’s chart and try to figure out where the next moves might run into trouble.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Tesla’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70b91188a094b:0-tesla-s-robotaxi-revolution-is-it-too-late-to-buy-the-stock/
Tesla Stock Is Falling. There's a New Board Member. — Barrons.com,1747660020000,"Al RootTesla stock was falling early Monday. The electric-vehicle maker has a new board member for investors to get to know.Shares of the electric vehicle maker were 4% down at $335.86, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 1% and 0.5% lower, respectively.Tesla appointed retired Chipotle Mexican Grill CFO Jack Hartung to the board of directors on Friday. He will serve on the audit committee and his appointment is effective on June 1.Hartung spent a quarter-century at Chipotle, starting when the restaurant chain had less than 200 stores. Today, Chipotle has more than 3,700 locations.The move, for now, expands Tesla's board to nine. The other members are board chair Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, James Murdoch, Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, J.B. Straubel, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and of course, Elon Musk.Tesla also included the disclosure that a son-in-law of Hartung has been a ""non-executive, salaried employee of Tesla since December 2016, and does not share a household with Mr. Hartung.""Expansion of the board with outside finance experience will likely be seen as a positive for the company, although board members don't typically move stocks.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, SoftBank, BOTZ and Tesla",1747831380000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, SoftBank Group SFTBY, the Global X Robotics & AI ETF BOTZ and Tesla TSLA.The Next Major Stock Trend: Humanoid RoboticsMaybe it's just my perception, but it feels as if innovation is truly accelerating. In just the last two years, we've experienced the integration of seemingly magical artificial intelligence into everyday life, major breakthroughs in quantum computing, and now, the emergence of humanoid robotics on the commercial stage.AI and quantum computing have already proven to be exceptionally lucrative trading opportunities, with related stocks surging in value. I believe humanoid robotics could be the next major breakout trend, offering investors similar, if not greater, long-term upside.Momentum is building fast. Humanoid robot demonstrations are becoming increasingly impressive, actual robot costs are dropping, and just this week, Nvidia unveiled its latest breakthrough: GR00T N1, the ""World's First Open Humanoid Robot Foundation Model.""As this trend gains traction, it's only a matter of time before Wall Street catches on. In this report, we'll explore four stocks, Nvidia , SoftBank Group , the Global X Robotics & AI ETF and Tesla , that are well-positioned to capitalize on the humanoid robotics revolution.Growth Forecasts in the Humanoid Robotics IndustryAccording to a new report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global humanoid robot market is projected to surge from $2.4 billion measured in 2023 to nearly $114 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 40%. This explosive growth is expected to be fueled by rising demand in healthcare, caregiving, and industrial automation, especially as labor shortages and aging populations drive adoption.One of the most exciting developments is the rapid growth of bipedal humanoid robots. While wheeled robots currently dominate the market, the biped segment, which more closely mimics human movement, is expected to be the fastest-growing category through 2028, expanding at a CAGR of over 54%.With falling hardware costs, advancing AI capabilities, and increasing real-world applications, humanoid robotics is no longer speculative, it's a market on the verge of exponential growth.Stock Market Opportunities in RoboticsQuite suddenly the humanoid robotics industry is an investable trend, and some of the world's most important tech companies are already leading the charge.Tesla is making waves with its Optimus robot, designed to perform repetitive or dangerous tasks. CEO Elon Musk envisions a future where humanoid robots will eventually surpass Tesla's car business in value. While the company received criticism for the robots being only semi-autonomous during the major unveil, where they were serving drinks and carrying on conversations, I think it actually identified some opportunities. Robots that are remotely controlled still offer tremendous usability and can speed up real-time implementation.Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI chips, just unveiled its new GR00T platform, a specialized system for training and deploying humanoid robots. The GR00T chip is designed to help robots learn from human behavior and generalize tasks across environments, a key capability for making humanoids useful in the real world. Nvidia's chips are already the backbone of AI and robotics innovation, and GR00T could be the next major growth engine.SoftBank Group has been investing in robotics for over a decade and owns Boston Dynamics and SoftBank Robotics, two of the most advanced robotics firms in the world. Their work includes the Atlas humanoid robot and the widely recognized robot dog Spot. Though SoftBank's portfolio is broad, its robotics division positions it well for upside if this theme takes off.For investors looking for broader exposure, the BOTZ ETF offers a diversified approach to the robotics trend. It holds companies across the global robotics value chain, including automation leaders, industrial robot manufacturers, and key AI enablers. As humanoid robotics gains traction, BOTZ provides an efficient way to invest in the full ecosystem.Together, these stocks and ETFs represent a compelling opportunity to get ahead of one of the most transformative tech trends of the next decade.Should Investors Buy Humanoid Robotics Stocks Now?While humanoid robotics may still seem futuristic to some, the pace of innovation and investment suggests the future is arriving sooner than expected. With major players like Nvidia, Tesla, and SoftBank already staking their claims, the groundwork is being laid for significant long-term upside.Investors don't need to go all in today. As with quantum and AI before it, the adoption curve will have fits and starts. But those who get in early, whether through single-name stocks like NVDA and TSLA or diversified vehicles like BOTZ, could be positioning themselves for the next great technology boom.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

China's Factory Boom Can't Hide a Crumbling Consumer Engine,1747659462000,"Industrial output in China just beat expectationsbut investors aren't celebrating yet. Factories posted a solid 6.1% year-on-year growth in April, surprising to the upside despite trade war aftershocks. But consumer spending? That's where the story softens. Retail sales came in weaker than expected at 5.1%, and car salestypically a reliable growth driverbarely moved. Even with subsidies in play, Chinese households are still hesitant to open their wallets, pointing to broader issues with wage growth, job security, and ongoing deflationary pressure.The property market remains a drag. Investment in real estate continues to fall, home prices are slipping faster, and household savings are hitting record highs as consumers shift more cash into time deposits. That's not a great sign for domestic demand. Infrastructure is holding up thanks to government bond issuance, but manufacturing investment is beginning to look shaky. Trade may have gotten a temporary breather from the 90-day US tariff pause, but uncertainty around the next phase could still weigh on corporate planning. Exporters have been rerouting shipments to Southeast Asia and Europebut that workaround has its limits.Even so, the resilience in China's factory data has prompted analysts at Nomura, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan to raise their 2025 growth forecasts to around 4.5%. That's still shy of Beijing's 5% target. For companies like Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA and others deeply tied to China's economic health, the picture remains nuanced: production is holding up, but without a real revival in consumer confidence, the runway for sustainable growth could be shorter than hoped. The next few monthsespecially with policymakers hinting at more supportcould be critical in setting the tone for the rest of the year.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:91a731d1b094b:0-china-s-factory-boom-can-t-hide-a-crumbling-consumer-engine/

Why Tesla’s 60% Surge Should Keep Going Into Summer,1747659300000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:TSLA] Shares of Tesla Inc. NASDAQ:TSLA closed just under $350 last week , capping off a blistering rally that has seen the stock climb 60% from its April lows. While it still has ground to cover before revisiting the highs near $500 from last December, momentum is clearly back . The company is starting to look more like Tesla, which energized investors in 2020 and 2021: ambitious, dynamic, and positioned for long-term dominance.Much of this move began after the company's latest earnings report in late April. Though the results fell short of Wall Street's expectations on a headline basis, the update cleared a cloud of uncertainty over the stock. Since then, sentiment has flipped decisively, with retail and institutional investors jumping back in.Musk Refocuses and Markets ApproveIn addition to the shift in sentiment post-earnings , CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he would be stepping back from White House-related efforts to dedicate more time to Tesla has also helped calm investor nerves. With confidence restored in leadership focus, the narrative quickly returned to the company's product pipeline, growth initiatives , and competitive advantages.The improving mood has now been supercharged by broader macro headlines, specifically around U.S. and China trade tensions . Developments suggesting a rollback of certain tariffs have helped power the latest leg higher, particularly given how sensitive Tesla's supply chain and demand dynamics are to the global EV ecosystem.$1 Trillion Market Cap ReclaimedTesla's valuation has surged in tandem with its share price. Last week, the company reclaimed a $1 trillion market cap for the first time in months, adding psychological weight to the rally. Market cap milestones don't impact fundamentals directly, but they do influence narrative, and the narrative right now is one of resurgence.At the technical level, shares are trading in a strong uptrend. The stock has cleared key  heavy-volume resistance points , and momentum indicators continue strengthening. The RSI is now around 70 , indicating overbought conditions, but not yet at the type of extended levels that would typically flash warning signs. This momentum could extend through the summer with the bulls firmly in contro l.Analysts Are Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:TSLA] The recent wave of analyst upgrades adds further weight to the bullish outlook. Last week, Mizuho's Vijay Rakesh boosted his price target on Tesla to $390 from $325, maintaining an Outperform rating . Rakesh cited the positive impact of easing trade tensions, particularly concerning electric vehicle parts imports, as a key driver.While he flagged the potential headwind of reduced EV subsidies in the U.S., he maintained a confident view of Tesla's macro setup and growth path  in the automotive space.This echoes Piper Sandler's move earlier this month when they issued a fresh $400 target on the stock . Taken together, these revised outlooks point to a growing consensus: Tesla's upside may only just be reawakening.Even after the recent run, these targets imply 12% to 15% additional upside , with some bulls calling for more if economic conditions remain favorable.Room to Run Into the SummerOne of the most encouraging aspects of Tesla's rebound is how balanced the rally has been. This isn't just a short squeeze or a speculative pop; it's a sustained move supported by technicals, macro tailwinds, and analyst validation . If trade headlines continue to improve, and the company delivers on growth metrics in the second half of the year, the stock could continue pushing toward those higher price targets.While the relative strength index is something to monitor, the current positioning suggests any short-term pullback could be shallow and met with eager buying. With institutional sentiment turning more positive and Tesla returning to a leadership role in tech, investors are beginning to price in a scenario where the stock retests and potentially surpasses its previous highs .Why This Rally May Still Be in Its Early StagesTesla has already made a 60% move in a matter of weeks, but the catalysts behind the rally suggest it may still be in the early days. With the $1 trillion milestone back in the rearview mirror, improved U.S.–China trade dynamics, and price targets climbing from top-tier analysts, this is a stock with the wind at its back.Momentum, macro, and Musk are all lining up, which could make Tesla one of the standout performers of the summer .Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:3a116684b094b:0-why-tesla-s-60-surge-should-keep-going-into-summer/
General Motors Ceases Vehicle Exports to China From the United States,1747829160000,"General Motors Company GM last week informed its employees and dealers involved in its China export operations that it will no longer ship vehicles from the United States to China. This decision comes amid ongoing trade and tariff negotiations between the United States and China.GM had been exporting vehicles to China through its premium import brand, The Durant Guild, which accounted for less than 0.1% of its total sales in the country, per a company spokesperson. Due to major shifts in economic conditions, GM has decided to restructure the Durant Guild and streamline its operations in China. Previously, U.S.-made goods imported into China were subject to tariffs exceeding 100%, though these were temporarily reduced as part of a 90-day agreement between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2025, General Motors and its joint ventures delivered more than 442,000 vehicles in China, marking year-over-year sales growth and the third straight quarter of increasing market share. Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, jumped 53.2% compared to the same period last year. GM, which already offers the most extensive NEV lineup among global automakers in China, plans to expand its portfolio further in 2025 by introducing extended-range electric vehicles, ensuring at least one NEV option for every new locally launched model. GM carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .In April, GM’s rival, Ford Motor Company F, paused shipments of several U.S.-built vehicles, including the F-150 Raptor, Mustang, Bronco and Lincoln Navigator, to China due to retaliatory tariffs that pushed import taxes as high as 150%. Ford is considered one of the automakers most capable of handling tariffs, as roughly 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built domestically. However, Ford may still increase prices on new vehicles if tariff woes deepen.Last month, Tesla, Inc. TSLA also halted new orders for its Model S and Model X on its Chinese website after China increased tariffs on U.S. imports. New orders for both Tesla models were also no longer accessible through the automaker's WeChat mini program in China. Rising competition from BYD and other domestic manufacturers has also hurt Tesla's sales in China.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:10ffb6a71094b:0-general-motors-ceases-vehicle-exports-to-china-from-the-united-states/
Stocks Decline Pre-Bell as Moody's Downgrades US Credit Ratings,1747654589000,"The benchmark US stock measures were trending downwards before the opening bell Monday as investors assessed Moody's downgrade of the world's largest economy's credit ratings. The S&P 500 declined 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 0.8%, and the Nasdaq fell 1.6% in premarket activity. The indexes finished Friday's trading session higher, with the S&P 500 recording gains for the fifth consecutive day. Moody's on Friday lowered the US government's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Aa1 from Aaa and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The downgrade reflects the increase in government debt and interest payment ratios over more than a decade ""to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" according to Moody's. The downgrade comes as the US and China recently agreed to suspend most duties on each other's goods for 90 days. The two countries had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3% in the March quarter, representing the first drop since the first quarter of 2022, government data showed late April. US Treasury yields moved higher in premarket action, with the two-year rate inclining 2.1 basis points to 4% and the 10-year rate advancing about 11 basis points to 4.54%. The 30-year rate climbed 12 basis points to more than 5%. With no major economic reports scheduled for Monday, traders will focus on commentary from key central bank officials for clues on future monetary policy, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Earlier in May, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate unchanged and warned that upside risks to inflation and unemployment have increased.

China's BYD turns up heat in Europe with launch of Dolphin Surf EV,1747827863000,"Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD's SZSE:002594 low-cost Dolphin Surf became its 10th model available in Europe on Wednesday, with the Berlin launch increasing pressure on European rivals to produce more affordable alternatives.The car will sell at three price points, from 22,990 euros ($26,100) for a 322-kilometre (200-mile) range, to 24,990 euros for a 507-kilometre range.Until the end of June, the three versions will be available at a discounted price of 19,990-24,990 euros, sales chief Patrick Schulz said on Wednesday.The car piles pressure on European automakers to offer more affordable electric alternatives, with cost still a major barrier to wider adoption of EVs.Only a handful of models, such as the Dacia Spring or Leapmotor's T03, are on sale in Europe for under 20,000 euros, although 11 new models priced under 25,000 euros will go on sale this year, including Volkswagen's XETR:VOW ID.2, the Renault R5, the Fiat Grand Panda, and the Hyundai Inster.""The compact segment is the next frontier for electrification in Europe,"" Maria Grazia Davino, BYD regional managing director for markets including Germany, said in Berlin. ""We think this market has huge potential.""The Chinese version of the vehicle, the Seagull, has fuelled BYD's exponential rise in China, second only to Tesla's NASDAQ:TSLA Model Y in total sales in 2024 with over 442,000 registrations.Globally, sales of the model have risen 45% this year so far to 170,000, BYD said on Wednesday.BYD, which last year surpassed Tesla to become the world's largest EV manufacturer, is overhauling its European operations, widening its dealer network, offering more hybrids and hiring managers with local experience, after early stumbles in the region stymied sales.Sales data indicates the revamp is working. In Germany, sales reached 2,791 in the first four months of the year, data from Germany's motor authority KBA showed, fast approaching the 2,891 vehicles it sold all year in 2024.That success is mirrored across Europe, where sales quadrupled in the first quarter to 37,201 cars, in sharp contrast to Tesla's sales, which plunged 37.2%.BYD will enter 12 new markets in Europe this year, Davino said, with sales locations to expand to over 1,000.($1 = 0.8808 euros)","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RT0SI:0-china-s-byd-turns-up-heat-in-europe-with-launch-of-dolphin-surf-ev/"

Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college.

South Africa's Ramaphosa aims to mend US ties with Musk business push,1747651726000,"South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa plans to discuss business opportunities for Elon Musk's companies during a visit to Washington this week aimed at mending relations with U.S. President Donald Trump , Ramaphosa's spokesperson said on Monday.Trump has taken aim at South Africa during his second term, citing disapproval of its land reform policy and of its genocide case against U.S. ally Israel before the International Court of Justice. His administration cut funding to the country in February and last week granted refugee status to a group of white South Africans it said were facing racial discrimination - a claim the South African government denies.The two heads of state are scheduled to meet on Wednesday. And South African officials have been preparing a trade proposal to present to Trump to reset the relationship. One potential proposal would be for Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA - led by Musk, a close ally and adviser to Trump - to receive favourable tariffs on its imports into South Africa in exchange for building electric vehicle charging stations. ""(It) could be one of the points discussed,"" Ramaphosa's spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said in response to a text message query on the matter.Asked about the question of licencing for Musk's satellite company Starlink, Magwenya said: ""Certainly, the issue will be discussed."" The United States has pushed some nations facing tariffs to approve Starlink, the Washington Post reported earlier this month, citing State Department cables. Musk, who is South African-born, has previously claimed Starlink was barred from operating in South Africa because he is not Black, an allegation South African officials refuted. South Africa's telecoms regulator said in March that Starlink had not applied for a licence.Musk's false claim appeared to be taking a swipe at local Black Economic Empowerment rules, requiring foreign-owned telecommunications licencees to sell 30% of the equity in their local subsidiaries to historically disadvantaged groups.South Africa's Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen, part of the delegation travelling to the United States on Monday, said he wanted to secure trade benefits for South African farmers.South African agricultural products currently enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Under Trump's tariff regime, however, that is now at risk.""Losing these benefits would be disastrous for farmers, farm workers and the economy at large,"" Steenhuisen said in a statement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RR0DA:0-south-africa-s-ramaphosa-aims-to-mend-us-ties-with-musk-business-push/"

Markets Beware Progress of Tax and Spending Bill. How Stocks Can Get Hit. — Barrons.com,1747651560000,"When it comes to tackling the government's budget deficit, there are a lot of politicians in Washington who are good at talking the talk, but very few who walk the walk.Just as Congress is trying to push through its latest tax plan, Moody's has downgraded U.S. debt. Combined with comments yesterday from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reminding everyone that tariffs could go back up again, that's a one-two punch that could make investors nervous this week.In a way, the downgrade is purely symbolic. Moody's is the last of the three main ratings firms to do it. And the reasons given are obvious — tax cuts are reducing revenue while spending continues to increase. Despite all the rhetoric about fiscal rectitude, even the latest proposal cuts taxes way more than it reduces spending — and those spending cuts may not hold, since popular programs like Medicaid are being targeted.Some say deficits don't matter. They're right, with one big caveat. They don't matter as long as bond yields stay low.So far, so good. The 10-year Treasury yield is still at around 4.5% — about the same as where it was a year ago. But if budget worries start pushing that yield up significantly, watch out. That will drive down stocks as well as bonds.That's because higher yields reduce the relative valuation of stocks, increase companies' borrowing costs, and ultimately slow economic growth. As Friday's consumer sentiment data showed, shoppers are already worried. A warning from Walmart that prices could rise in the wake of a tariff hit does not help. Earnings from Home Depot, Lowe's, and Target this week will add some more color.For now, deficit worries may well just be hot air in a storm that blows over. But keep an eye on bond yields to learn when all the talk gets real.- Brian Swint*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R. Rublin and deputy editor Ben Levisohn today at noon when they discuss the outlook for financial markets, industry sectors, and individual stocks. Sign up here.***Bessent Dismisses Moody's U.S. Debt Downgrade as 'Lagging Indicator'Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent played down worries about Moody's decision late Friday to downgrade U.S. sovereign debt from AAA status to Aa1, telling NBC News on Sunday that ratings firm actions are ""a lagging indicator."" He blamed federal spending during the Biden administration for what Moody's cited in its reasoning.- Moody's was the last major credit-rating firm to downgrade U.S. debt, warning it is on a trajectory to increase federal government spending. Lawmakers are trying to extend President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which could add $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. - Markets have likely absorbed some of the reaction given that the U.S. hasn't had a perfect AAA rating across all major agencies for some time, said Gregory Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income. He expects the impact to be minimal. - Recent Treasury auctions show net buying of U.S. debt by indirect bidders such as central banks, according to Ben Emons, chief investment officer and founder of FedWatch Advisors. Weekly Japanese Ministry of Finance data also shows Japan continuing U.S. Treasury purchases. - Trump's temporary pause of 145% tariffs on goods from China improved the macroeconomic outlook considerably, reducing recession risk and helping lift stock markets into positive territory for the year. But Treasury yields also rose from 4.1% back to nearly 4.5%. What's Next: Inflation data doesn't yet reflect the higher tariff levels that were in place in China for more than a month before last week's reprieve. Higher inflation could keep Treasury yields elevated as the Fed hesitates to cut interest rates, which could also pressure U.S. stocks, Emons said.- Laura Sanicola and Janet H. Cho***More Retailers Expected to Detail Effects of Tariffs This WeekAnalysts will listen closely to Target, Home Depot and other retailers reporting earnings this week, especially what they say about how tariffs will affect prices. Walmart said last week that it would have to raise prices to counteract rising costs from tariffs, something President Donald Trump told it to ""eat.""- Tariffs have been discussed on corporate earnings calls in the past two months the most in a decade, according to FactSet. Along the same vein, the word ""uncertainty"" has come up the most since 2020, the year the pandemic hit. Mentions of the word ""recession"" are their highest since the end of 2022. - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday he has spoken with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who said last week the retailer would raise prices in response to tariffs. Trump criticized McMillon's comments in a social media post Saturday telling Walmart to ""eat"" the tariffs and stop blaming them for rising prices. - Bessent told CNN's State of the Union that Walmart would be absorbing some of the tariffs, while acknowledging that ""some may get passed onto consumers."" But he added that inflation was down, notably in the retail price of gasoline. - Trump has insisted that the cost of U.S. tariffs on imported goods won't be borne by American consumers, despite what business leaders have been saying. Last week, the Western-wear retailer Boot Barn highlighted strong sales trends but also said demand -- and its margins -- could take a hit from tariffs. What's Next: After pausing his so-called reciprocal tariffs while bilateral trade deals are discussed, Trump now says various countries will be getting letters telling them what the tariffs on their goods will be. Bessent warned tariff rates of 10% to 49% could come back for countries that don't negotiate in good faith.- Liz Moyer***Tesla's Chinese Deliveries Will Be Closely WatchedTesla has been trying to recover from a brand backlash related to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, and another reading on its progress could come this week, with an update on the electric-vehicle maker's Chinese deliveries. Wall Street is closely watching, and analysts might need to revise second-quarter sales forecasts.- Musk promised in April that he would leave behind his work slashing the federal government and renew his focus on Tesla, where first-quarter delivery numbers fell 13% from a year earlier. Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver 7% fewer cars in the second quarter than a year ago. - Second-quarter sales were looking weak in China in the first six weeks of the quarter, based on registration data that said they fell about 26% from a year ago. April sales in European markets including France, Germany, and the U.K., fell about 49% from a year ago, after dropping 45% in the first quarter. - A figure of 13,000 deliveries in China for the week would be close to flat from a year ago and a sign that things are normalizing, while a figure below 13,000 would make Wall Street analysts reconsider second-quarter estimates. - General Motors is pushing to eliminate or modify California's EV targets, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a memo sent to employees. California wants 35% of new car sales to be EVs or plug-in hybrids in 2026, and to eliminate gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. Eleven states are following its model. What's Next: California's EV goals are lofty considering current sales penetration rates are still far below its targets. GM told Barron's in an email that it continues to focus on offering the best and broadest portfolio of vehicles on the market and that it has long supported consistency in emissions regulations.- Al Root and Janet H. Cho***Crypto Industry Hopes for Victory on Stablecoins. What What Comes Next.The crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.- As soon as today, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets such as Treasury bills. - Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and give holders of coins priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy. Stablecoins, with a market value of $250 billion, underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. - The largest stablecoin, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global. Currently used mostly for trading, issuers think stablecoins could challenge traditional payments networks. - There are some issues with the industry's push. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. Second is President Donald Trump. He and his family could profit from majority ownership of stablecoin issuer World Liberty Financial. What's Next: The crypto industry has a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and crypto token issuers. Trump has been more crypto friendly than the Biden administration, but the industry is concerned regulation will get stricter without rules around how they are policed.- Joe Light***Buffett Won't Be on Stage Next Berkshire Meeting: Report It looks like Berkshire Hathaway's 2026 annual meeting in Omaha will be the Greg Abel show. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett won't be on stage to answer shareholder questions next year, according to a report.- Abel, 62, is set to take over as CEO at the beginning of next year. Buffett's daughter Susan, a member of the Berkshire board, told The Omaha World-Herald newspaper that her father felt it was appropriate for Abel to be on stage without him, given Abel's future role. - ""I'm not going to be up there,"" she recalled him saying. ""I'm going to leave it to Greg."" Barron's has reached out to Berkshire for comment. - Buffett surprised Berkshire investors on May 3 when he said he would be stepping down as CEO at year-end. Buffett answered questions for four-and-a-half hours at the recent gathering, and many Berkshire investors would have liked to see him on stage another year. - Some investors thought Buffett would agree to appear in 2026 on stage to help the city of Omaha, which generates considerable revenue from the huge crowd at the annual meeting. An estimated 40,000 people attended the 2025 meeting, but it's likely that number will shrink next year without Buffett. What's Next: An Abel-oriented Q&A session is likely to have one key benefit — more Berkshire-related questions. Many shareholders who would like to better understand the complex and diversified conglomerate have been frustrated that many questions at the annual meeting are unrelated to the company — for example, one of the first questions at the 2025 meeting was about a hot-dog business that a shareholder thought Berkshire owned but is actually owned by Berkshire Partners, a private-equity firm.- Andrew Bary***MarketWatch Wants to Hear From YouClasses and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.

"TSLA: Tesla Stock Gains as Elon Musk Vows to Bet Less on Politics, Focus on Business",1747816255000,"Billionaire CEO spoke at a Qatar conference, saying he planned to still be the Tesla boss five years from now. Shares were the only bright spot in the Big Tech realm. 🚗 Breaking Away from Mag 7 Slump- Tesla stock NASDAQ:TSLA bucked the broader Big Tech, Mag 7 slump on Tuesday, as CEO Elon Musk told a global audience he’s stepping back from political spending to refocus on the business. Speaking via video at the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk said he plans to reduce his involvement in US politics — at least for now, at least financially. - “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said. “I think I’ve done enough.” - Estimates show that the billionaire-turned-unelected-politician spent as much as $300 million backing President Trump’s 2024 campaign, emerging as one of the biggest individual political contributors of the cycle. But right now, Musk says he sees “no reason” to continue funding political efforts unless something changes. 📣 Musk Seeks More Control of Tesla- In addition to dialing down his political bets, Musk made it clear he’s sticking with Tesla — and doesn’t plan on leaving anytime soon. Asked if he’d still be Tesla CEO in five years, he answered simply, “Yes,” before adding, “Well, I might die.” - In characteristic fashion, Musk added a dose of nuance to his long-term commitment: he wants voting control to avoid being kicked out by activist shareholders. Later on Tuesday in a CNBC interview, Musk said he’s aiming to increase his stake in Tesla to 25%, up from the 12.77% he currently holds — a position worth over $140 billion. - “That’s the number I’d feel comfortable at, because that’s where I have some control, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out,” Musk explained. “If I’m destroying the value of the company or if I’ve just gone flat-out crazy,” he added, “they could still remove me.” 🤫 Wall Street’s Nod of Approval- Shares of the EV maker rose during a session that saw most of the tech sector in the red. Investors appeared to appreciate Musk’s recommitment to Tesla’s future and his hint at stepping away from politics — a topic that’s drawn controversy and criticism from some shareholders and the broader public. - Less drama and more deliveries? Sounds like a plan, maybe. Especially when looking ahead to the planned robotaxi launch.

Best-Performing ETFs of Last Week,1747645740000,"U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, marking the fifth consecutive day of gains and capping off a robust week for Wall Street. Investors brushed off disappointing consumer sentiment data and lingering inflation concerns to quite an extent.

NVIDIA NVDA and Tesla TSLA shares surged last week, due to Trump's Middle East dealmaking tour.

Meanwhile, NVIDIA will send 18,000 AI chips to Saudi Arabia.Consumer Sentiment Slips, Inflation Expectations RiseDespite the market's gains, economic data revealed persistent consumer unease.

Moreover, consumers now anticipate prices to rise by 7.3% over the next year, indicating an increase from 6.5% the previous month.Trade Truce Eases Investor FearsInvestor sentiment was buoyed by a 90-day tariff truce between U.S. and Chinese officials, calming fears of an escalating trade war. The agreement helped drive risk-on behavior and renewed confidence in the markets.“Markets are repricing the stagflation risk right now,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, as quoted on CNBC. “The U.S. consumer may say he/she is worried, but they aren’t spending like they are. Consumption trumps all once you filter out all the noise.”Looking Ahead: Tariff Uncertainty RemainsWhile the truce brought temporary relief, trade uncertainty looms. President Donald Trump announced that his administration will begin sending letters to various countries outlining new tariff rates within the next two to three weeks. These letters would replace direct negotiations in cases where time constraints exist.Winning ETFs in FocusAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of last week.YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF SMCY – Up 27.6% last weekThe YieldMax SMCI Option Income Strategy ETF seeks current income and exposure to the share price of the common stock of Super Micro Computer, Inc., subject to a limit on potential investment gains.

The Top Corporate Board Directors — Journal Report,1747614660000,"By Theo FrancisThey oversee airlines, oil companies, home-improvement chains and makers of products ranging from deodorant to fighter jets. About half are CEOs, or once were. Roughly as many identify as women or racial or ethnic minorities.They are the 250 most influential and effective directors at big, publicly traded U.S. companies, as ranked in the inaugural Wall Street Journal Top Board Directors listing.At the very top: Edward Philip, the independent chairman of United Airlines. Philip made his name in executive roles at Lycos, a pioneering internet search company, and went on to head operations for Partners In Health, the global nonprofit bringing medical care to some of the world's poorest places.Joining Philip as the five highest-ranked directors are Home Depot's Stephanie Linnartz, who once ran sportswear brand Under Armour; Debra Reed-Klages, a former utility-company CEO on the boards of Caterpillar, Chevron and Lockheed Martin; Joseph Jimenez, a former Novartis CEO who is lead director at Procter & Gamble and on the boards of General Motors and Century Therapeutics; and Gregory Boyce, a former coal-company CEO on the board of mining company Newmont.""We're in an increasingly complex world where corporate leadership is being called on to grapple with all kinds of challenges and opportunities,"" says Rick Wartzman, co-president of Bendable Labs, the research and consulting firm that created the ranking for The Wall Street Journal Leadership Institute. ""Directors are being called on to take an ever more important role.""To find the most effective and influential directors, Bendable analyzed data on more than 4,000 nonemployee directors of S&P 500 companies, as well as data on those companies and others at which the directors served. The analysis took into account a range of third-party scores, including company performance, activist vulnerability and corporate governance, as well as data on directors' backgrounds and their roles within their boards. (See more methodology details here.)""So much of what happens in board deliberations and in board meetings, we really don't know,"" Wartzman says. ""We tried to take what is public and available and where there are credible third-party assessments of different risks to a company where boards seemed to have an important role to play.""The ranking seeks to shed light on a longstanding but elusive question in corporate governance: What makes a good director?The rise of independentsFor decades, directors even at the largest publicly traded companies were often appointed from the ranks of big shareholders, upper management and their associates in business and society. These days, no more than one or two members of the C-suite sit around the boardroom table, and most or all of the other directors count as independent under the rules of the markets the company's shares trade on. (Those rules don't cover every kind of potential conflict.)Yet boards remain notoriously difficult to evaluate. Directors oversee the company for shareholders, but management is responsible for execution. Beyond formal securities disclosures and corporate reports, it can be hard to draw a bead on what boards do. Most seek consensus and minimize disagreement, especially in public.Ultimately, corporate boards are like firehouses, says B. Espen Eckbo, a Dartmouth College finance professor who ran its corporate-governance center for two decades. Until there's a fire, it is hard to know how well they function.""The company runs itself in good times — but when it gets to some times with fires, then the board has to really step up and save the company from making big mistakes,"" says Eckbo, who wasn't involved in the Journal's ranking. ""The best way to go about it is to create a board that thinks like shareholders.""Academic research hasn't found strong evidence for director characteristics that contribute directly to company performance, although most experts believe that sizable stock ownership likely spurs directors to think more like the shareholders they represent, and that having an outside CEO on the board seems to help, but more than one isn't necessarily better.CEO experience makes directors more sensitive to the challenges faced by executives — and to the line between the board's role and the chief executive's, says Lloyd Carney, No. 73 on the list and a longtime tech executive who currently chairs the board of Grid Dynamics and sits on the boards of Visa and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.""Hire the CEO, support the CEO, fire the CEO if you have to, and always guide the long-term strategy,"" Carney says. ""The last thing you want is the board flying in every three months trying to tell you how to run the business.""Parsing the dataIn the Journal's ranking, the 250 top directors vary in the length and breadth of their board service. About half the directors sit on just one board, as do seven of the top 10 directors, while most of the rest sit on two; only a few dozen directors sit on three or four (45 and 11, respectively). Among the directors sitting on four are former Alcatel-Lucent CEO Patricia Russo, who is on the boards of Merck, General Motors, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and KKR.Half a dozen directors on the list have held a seat for at least a quarter-century — including longtime tech executive and investor Harvey Jones, an Nvidia director since 1993, and Russo, who has been on the board of Merck and predecessor Schering-Plough since 1995. Another 17 took at least one of their seats within the past year or so, including Marissa Mayer, the former Yahoo chief executive who joined AT&T's board last year. (The ranking only considers directors set to serve terms through year-end 2025.)Directors in the ranking had no role in creating it, though some are expected to be unpaid participants in a new conference series by the WSJ Leadership Institute.In all, 48 companies have at least three directors among the top 250. Home Depot and Allstate have nine apiece, while Procter & Gamble has eight and Wells Fargo has seven — in each case, majorities of each board.""Part of what makes a great board is constructive collaboration with each other and with management,"" says Linnartz, who sits on Home Depot's audit and compensation committees.At Home Depot, each director meets quarterly with a member of senior management, whether to tour stores or dig into some operational challenge, getting to know the business deeply.When the coronavirus pandemic hit two years after she joined Home Depot's board, the board's familiarity with the company and its systematic strategic planning were evident, says Linnartz. The foundation was in place for a rapid expansion of the company's business to meet demand.Individual vs. corporate factorsCompany characteristics and results play a small part in the ranking, contributing around 10% of each director's score on average. A one-year total shareholder return that surpassed other companies in the same industry, or the S&P 500 as a whole, boosted scores, while measures of poor audit quality, activist vulnerability and high-profile controversies reduced them.More influential: a measure of corporate prominence, based on the company's ranking in Fortune Magazine's list of the biggest and most influential companies, which accounted for around a fifth of the average combined score.Individual characteristics were the biggest driver in the ranking, contributing about two-thirds of directors' final scores on average.In some cases, a strong individual score made up for a poor company showing: Donald Knauss, a director of Target, McKesson and Kellanova, ranked No. 13 overall despite low corporate scores brought on by audit-quality penalties at all three companies, and penalties for activist vulnerability and litigation at McKesson and Target. Helping him: past CEO experience, serving on the boards of three such prominent companies, and leadership roles on each of the boards, including serving as lead director at Kellanova and board chairman at McKesson.Many of the highest-scoring directors got there in part by serving on or chairing at least one of three key board committees: the audit committee, tasked with a range of financial oversight; the compensation committee, which sets CEO pay; and the nomination committee, which vets candidates for board seats.The five top-ranked directors, for example, hold a combined 15 seats on those three committees, at nine S&P 500 companies, and chaired five of them. (Some serve on other committees as well.) Four also served as lead independent director or independent chairman for one or more companies: Jimenez at P&G and Century Therapeutics, Philip at United Airlines, Reed-Klages at Caterpillar and Boyce at Newmont.""Typically, those leadership positions are based on the experience the other directors value in that director,"" says Knauss, who previously ran Clorox.More is lessThe ranking also docked 15 directors for serving on all three of the key committees, on the grounds that it could blunt a director's effectiveness.That rule bumped Robyn Denholm, Tesla's high-profile board chair, from the top spot, landing her at No. 8 instead. Denholm chairs Tesla's audit committee and sits on its compensation and nominating committees, roles that contributed to criticism by Delaware's Court of Chancery when it found the company cut corners when awarding CEO Elon Musk a pay package that ran to billions of dollars in stock options.A spokesman for Denholm declined to comment.Four directors making the list did so despite receiving less than 80% shareholder support in proxy voting, including Ellen Kullman, lead director at Dell Technologies, with 62.7%, and Carney, who chairs the Grid Dynamics nominating committee, with 72.2%.Most big-company directors win 90% support or better, and analysts often consider anything under 80% as cause for concern. Investors often oppose committee chairs based on fixed voting policies or to make a statement. Some withholding support from Carney flagged that women make up less than 30% of Grid Dynamics' board.Carney notes just two of Grid Dynamics' eight nonemployee directors are white men. He concluded the board didn't need to change as it grappled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then home to nearly half of the company's employees.""We have who we need to make the company successful,"" Carney says. ""My focus is, how do I keep my employees safe, how do I keep the company executing to its true north?""One thing that is difficult to capture in any rankings: personality traits like flexibility, the courage to question decisions and a clear vision of the distinction between the board's role and management.""On paper he or she could have the most stellar background or track record but not really say much, not have much to add — is that value to the company and shareholders?"" says Constantine Alexandrakis, CEO of Russell Reynolds Associates, which places directors and helps boards evaluate their own effectiveness. ""Or are they taking up a seat that could be filled by someone who has a more thoughtful approach?""Ken Denman, No. 14 in the Journal ranking and chair of Costco Wholesale's audit committee and Motorola Solutions' governance and nominating committee, says he looks for intellectual curiosity in potential board members, as well as an understanding of the board's role in asking questions without micromanaging.""At the top level, I think board work is all about being part of an effective team,"" says Denman, who has served as CEO of several tech companies, including one acquired by Apple in 2016.""While the company may have a particular mission, a particular focus, a particular area of expertise — inevitably the world changes,"" Denman says. ""Each person has to know, here's what I can bring to the table.""Theo Francis is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter based in Washington, D.C.

Tesla Demand Hasn't Rebounded Yet. Watch China This Week. — Barrons.com,1747585200000,"Al RootInvestors are looking for evidence that brand ""challenges"" caused by Tesla CEO Elon Musk's politics are fading. They're still waiting. A weekly update from China could be a sign this week.Most recent sales data for the electric vehicle maker just hasn't been good, putting second-quarter delivery estimates at risk. Still, there is one caveat: Most of the data is from April, and Musk announced he would step back from some of his government responsibilities at the end of April.The first three months of the year didn't go as planned. Tesla delivered about 337,000 cars in the first quarter, down 13% from a year earlier and far below what Wall Street expected. At the start of 2025, the first-quarter delivery estimate was about 455,000 vehicles, according to FactSet. The miss even had CFO Vaibhav Taneja citing brand image ""challenges"" on his company's first-quarter earnings conference call.Those challenges might have been part of the reason Musk promised on the conference call to spend more time at Tesla than in Washington, D.C.Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was up 47% since the earnings report. An outside observer might assume some sales pickup has contributed to gains. They would be wrong.April sales in key European markets, including France, Germany, and the U.K., fell about 49% from a year ago after dropping about 45% in the first quarter.Tesla's April U.S. sales dropped about 13% after falling 9% in the first quarter. (Tesla's California sales dipped 15% in the first quarter.)April losses accelerated while things were supposed to be getting better with a new version of the Model Y shipping. The model refresh pickup has been slower than expected. Tesla forecaster, who goes by @troyteslike on X and who is widely followed by Wall Street, projects U.S. Model Y production of about 84,000 in the second quarter, up 17% from the first quarter but down about 12% from a year ago.In China, the second quarter started weakly, likely because of U.S.-China trade tensions. Tesla sales in the first six weeks of the second quarter, based on registration data followed by Wall Street, fell about 26% from a year ago. Chinese sales were roughly flat in the first quarter.Investors can look for 13,000 Chinese deliveries from last week when the number becomes available. That would be close to flat from a year ago and a sign that things were normalizing. Below 13,000, and Wall Street will start to reconsider second-quarter estimates.Currently, Wall Street expects about 412,000 cars delivered, up more than 20% from the first quarter but down 7% from last year.What the impact of falling delivery estimates on the stock is hard to say. They haven't impacted the stock lately. The stock market, of course, is forward-looking. Right now, investors are excited about self-driving taxis and robots. (Tesla is planning to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.) Still, growing car sales certainly couldn't hurt the situation.Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock was down about 13% year to date, 12 percentage points behind the S&P 500.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla (TSLA) Faces Scrutiny as Morgan Stanley Flags Valuation Gaps,1747777368000,"Tesla (TSLA, Financials) continues to draw scrutiny from Wall Street as Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said the company's valuation is increasingly difficult to justify, even after 15 years on the public market.Tesla trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 181.98x, well above most growth stocks. The stock is up more than 95% over the past 12 months but has declined 15% so far in 2025. According to TipRanks data cited in the report, much of Tesla's valuation rests on opaque or pre-commercialized business segments.Jonas maintains a Buy rating with a $410 price target, suggesting nearly 20% upside. But he said most investors continue to evaluate Tesla solely based on its electric vehicle unitassigning just $50$100 per share to that segmentwhile overlooking other high-potential verticals.Morgan Stanley's sum-of-the-parts model gives significant weight to Tesla's energy storage, robotaxi, and humanoid robot businesses. Jonas estimates the energy storage segment alone is worth $67 per share, excluding future recurring revenues.The autonomous Cybercab service is expected to launch in Austin next month with 10 to 20 vehicles. Additionally, Jonas projected that Tesla's Optimus robot, if it replaces just 1% of global human labor, could add over $300 billion in valueor about $100 per share.Jonas argued that investors' narrow focus is equivalent to valuing Amazon (AMZN, Financials) solely as a retailer or Apple (AAPL, Financials) only as a device company, missing the broader innovation ecosystem.Investors should monitor Tesla's upcoming robotaxi rollout and a potential Optimus event later in 2025 as catalysts that could reshape the company's valuation narrative.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:77874274c094b:0-tesla-tsla-faces-scrutiny-as-morgan-stanley-flags-valuation-gaps/
SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The stock is down 15% so far in 2025.Musks remarks came during an economic forum in Qatar, where he said maintaining reasonable control of the electric vehicle maker is the key reason for his continued tenure.His comments follow reports that Teslas board had approached search firms about finding his replacement. Chair Robyn Denholm denied those claims earlier this month.Musk said Teslas sales had rebounded outside Europe, where protests over his political activity have weighed on demand.Tesla reported a 13% drop in first-quarter deliveries as buyers waited for cheaper versions of its redesigned Model Y crossover, its top-selling vehicle.Musk also said Starlink, SpaceXs satellite internet unit, could go public in the future but that there is no rush for an IPO. Starlink currently operates in more than 70 countries, with a push into emerging markets such as India.On artificial intelligence, Musk said U.S. regulation is needed but warned against overregulation.
