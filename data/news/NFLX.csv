These 3 Companies Crushed Earnings Season,1748013300000,"The 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly winding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has overall been positive, though commentary surrounding upcoming periods has largely dictated post-earnings moves amid elevated uncertainty stemming from tariff talks.Still, several companies – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – knocked it out of the park, posting robust results that had shareholders pleased. Let’s take a closer look at each release for those interested in near-term momentum.Netflix Shares SurgeConsistently strong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors amid the uncertain environment. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid other trends like the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has been the real highlight from Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.As shown below, Netflix’s sales growth has remained rock-solid, posting double-digit percentage YoY growth in six consecutive periods.Eaton Breaks RecordsEaton’s results were fantastic, with the company posting record Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.72 (up 13% YoY), record Q1 sales of $6.4 billion (up 7% YoY), and record segment margins of 23.9% (80 bp increase YoY). Further, organic sales growth totaled 9%, above the high end of previous guidance. ETN topped off the results by raising its organic revenue growth guidance for its current fiscal year.Backlog growth within its Electrical segment improved 6% year-over-year, whereas its Aerospace backlog also enjoyed a 16% surge from the year-ago period. The company’s top line has shown solid, consistent growth, as shown below.In addition to consistent sales growth, the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, sporting a 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. As shown in the annual chart below, ETN’s dividend growth has remained strong not just over the last five years, but over the last decade overall.Please note that the final value in the chart below is tracked on a trailing twelve-month basis, as the company’s current fiscal year hasn’t ended yet.Centene Raises OutlookAdjusted EPS of $2.90 and sales of $46.6 billion from Centene blew away our consensus estimates, with earnings up a strong 28% year-over-year. Higher than expected membership growth led the company to up its 2025 premium and service revenues guidance by $6.0 billion, which already improved by a strong 17% YoY throughout the quarter.As shown below, Centene’s sales have remained strong over recent periods, with the most recent period reflecting a notable acceleration. The company also maintained its current year EPS guidance, providing investors with a nice sense of stability in an anxious setting.Analysts adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the release and guidance upgrade, with Centene now expected to post $179.6 billion in revenues in its current fiscal year. The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bottom LineThe 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly grinding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has been positive so far, with all three companies above – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – posting robust results and either reaffirming or raising their guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:b0e15118c094b:0-these-3-companies-crushed-earnings-season/
ProSieben boards advise against takeover bid from Berlusconis' MFE,1747909089000,"The boards of ProSiebenSat.1 XETR:PSM have advised against an ""inadequate"" takeover bid from MFE-MediaForEurope MIL:MFEA , the TV broadcaster controlled by Italy's Berlusconi family, the German broadcaster said on ThursdayMFE, which has commercial TV operations in Italy and Spain, made an offer for ProSieben in March as part of a push to create a pan-European broadcaster - a strategy resisted by ProSieben, which is striving to remain independent. ""Both governing bodies have concluded that the offer is inadequate from a financial perspective,"" ProSiebenSat.1 said in a statement, adding that it ""does not reflect the expected future development of the value of the company"".Milan-listed MFE, which holds a 30.14% stake in ProSieben declined to comment.Earlier this month, Czech investment firm PPF, which holds a 15% stake in ProSiben, launched a bid to lift its stake in the German broadcaster up to 29.99%, a move welcomed by ProSiebenSat.MFE made a cash-and-share bid at the minimum level allowed by German takeover rules, offering 4.48 euros in cash and 0.4 MFE A shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share.That is below the current share price of 7.09 euros and PPF's offer of 7 euros per share. Having already crossed a 30% threshold which normally triggers a mandatory 100% takeover offer under German law, MFE will have the option to buy additional shares in the market after the end of its buyout bid.However, a source close to the matter told Reuters last week that it is also weighing whether to raise its bid in response to the counter-proposal by PPF.MFE is looking to build a European ad-funded TV platform to resist competition from the likes of U.S. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and is pushing for an accelerated sale of ProSiebenSat.1's online investments in order to reduce its debt.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RU0ON:0-prosieben-boards-advise-against-takeover-bid-from-berlusconis-mfe/"
Netflix (NFLX) Adds Sesame Street After Trump Cuts PBS Funding,1747844121000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) will begin streaming Sesame Street after Warner Bros Discovery declined to renew its deal and U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order cutting funding to the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio.The agreement gives Netflix global rights to a new season and 90 hours of archived episodes. The show will also remain available on PBS, which will receive new episodes the same day they debut on Netflix. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting confirmed it is terminating a federal program that previously funded children's content like Sesame Street .The platform shift comes as Netflix increases its investment in children's programming, which accounts for about 15% of its total viewership. The company also announced new Peppa Pig episodes and a related mobile game featuring puzzles and coloring.Sesame Street , which first aired in 1969, was created with input from child psychologists and Muppet designer Jim Henson to promote early learning. It has long tackled public policy themes, from childhood obesity to arts education, and has featured public figures like Michelle Obama promoting healthy habits.The deal gives Sesame Street access to Netflix's 300 million global subscribers, expanding its reach beyond U.S. public television at a time of shifting media budgets and policy pressure.- See Netflix insider trades. - Explore Netflix's Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:06aa4f229094b:0-netflix-nflx-adds-sesame-street-after-trump-cuts-pbs-funding/
Epic Games' Fortnite returns to Apple App Store in US after nearly 5 years,1747781346000,"Epic Games' wildly popular multiplayer shooter game ""Fortnite"" is available again on Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL App Store in the U.S. from Tuesday, capping a ban of nearly five years and marking a major win for the video game company. Epic Games, a U.S.-based studio backed by China's Tencent HKEX:700 , has been locked in a legal battle with Apple since 2020. Epic Games alleged the iPhone maker's practice of charging a commission of up to 30% on in-app payments violated U.S. antitrust rules.Fortnite's return to Apple's iOS systems in the U.S. follows an April 30 ruling by a federal judge saying that Apple violated a U.S. court order that required the company to allow greater competition for app downloads and payment methods in its App Store. The ruling also said that Apple had failed to comply with the judge's prior injunction order and would be referred to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Fortnite's return to its App Store. ""We back fam,"" Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on social media platform X.Launched in 2017, Fortnite became an instant hit, drawing millions of players around the world thanks to its last-player-standing, ""battle royale"" format. At the time of the ban, Epic had 116 million users just on Apple's platform.""For Epic Games this was a hard fought win that carried a very steep price and may be too late to boost its Fortnite game that is now past its prime,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""For Apple this is another crack in the armor that the services business relies on — the funneling of payments through Apple in order to charge developers for every transaction.""Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, said this opened the door for subscription apps like Spotify NYSE:SPOT and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX to claw back margin and for independent studios to monetize without having to pay Apple an extra commission, potentially reshaping iOS economics over the next 12-18 months. Apple and Alphabet's Google NASDAQ:GOOG had banned Fortnite from their stores in 2020 over a tussle about in-app payment guidelines. The game had already returned to Google's Android devices worldwide and iPhones in the EU last year.The game title was also available on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union, Fortnite said on X on Tuesday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RS1LP:0-epic-games-fortnite-returns-to-apple-app-store-in-us-after-nearly-5-years/"

2 Reasons Netflix’s 40% Rally Is Far From Over,1747765860000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Shares of  Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on an absolute tear in recent weeks.They’re now  up more than 40% since the first week of April, breaking through previous records and entering the rarefied four-figure price range . While that kind of move tends to raise concerns about overheating, especially with the RSI now at 68 , there are still two major reasons to believe the rally could continue into the summer, and why any pullback should be viewed as a buying opportunity.1. Fundamentals Are Red HotNetflix’s latest earnings release firmly put its growth story in the spotlight. The company reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that came in well ahead of expectations, with the latter up 12.5% year-over-year . But what stood out most were the operating metrics. Operating income climbed 27% , while operating margin reached 32% , up from 28% a year earlier . Management also guided to even stronger profitability , forecasting a 33% margin for Q2 and reaffirming their full-year target of 29% .The top-line outlook was also upgraded. Netflix now expects full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion , up from previous guidance and above consensus estimates .This reflects not only price increases and membership growth but also a sharp uptick in ad revenue , which the company says will roughly double in 2025.Subscriber growth was another standout.Netflix added 18.91 million net new subscribers in the quarter, blowing away expectations of 9.18 million . It was the highest quarterly net addition in company history, showing the platform is still gaining traction despite rising competition and market maturity.2. Wall Street Is Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Following that blowout report, analysts have begun to revise their targets higher. Last week, Wolfe Research reiterated its bullish stance and issued a new price target of $1,340. This echoed the call from Robert Baird who lifted its target to $1,300 , while Canaccord Genuity Group went even further, calling for $1,380 .Those targets imply more than 15% upside from where the stock closed on Monday. That’s a significant projection for a company of Netflix’s size, especially after such a strong run. It also shows that many believe this is not the top but rather a new baseline from which the next leg higher can form.These bullish forecasts are backed by Netflix’s ability to monetize its subscriber base through pricing, premium content, and a fast-growing ad business. With record subscriber growth and rising profitability, the company is executing at a level few of the tech giants can match.Why One Major Firm Just Turned CautiousEven with Netflix firing on all cylinders, some analysts are beginning to voice caution, not about the business, but the stock’s near-term setup. On Monday, J.P. Morgan  downgraded Netflix to Neutral from Overweight , citing a more balanced risk/reward profile following the stock’s significant rally.With shares hitting all-time highs and trading at roughly 39x 2026 earnings and 44x free cash flow , the valuation has started to limit the upside in the short term.The firm still sees Netflix as a long-term leader in global streaming, driven by top-tier content, accelerating profitability, and a dominant position in the shift away from linear TV. But with macro conditions improving and market risk appetite broadening, the team there expects some capital rotation away from defensive names like Netflix toward more beaten-down sectors.What to Watch in the Weeks AheadThey also noted that following recent events like the company’s  Upfront presentation , Netflix may face a quieter period on the catalyst front as it heads into summer, even with strong Q3 content on deck .Still, the structural bull case remains intact . Netflix’s ability to scale globally, grow advertising revenue, and retain its content advantage means pullbacks should be seen in context: as a natural pause in a longer-term uptrend , not a reversal.

'Sesame Street' Finds a New Home on Netflix — WSJ,1747679640000,"By Joseph De AvilaElmo and Cookie Monster are heading to Netflix.The streaming giant has reached an agreement to broadcast new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" giving the beloved children's show a home after Warner Bros. Discovery said it was stepping away from the program.The agreement, which begins with the upcoming 56th season, includes 90 hours of previous episodes. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization that produces ""Sesame Street, "" said new episodes will also air on PBS stations and PBS Kids the same day they debut on Netflix. PBS has broadcast ""Sesame Street"" for over 50 years. Under its previous deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, PBS could only show new episodes months after they aired on HBO.The deal serves ""as a unique public-private partnership to enable 'Sesame Street' to continue to help children everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder,"" Sesame Workshop said.Warner Bros. Discovery said in December it wouldn't renew its deal with Sesame Workshop to air new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" leaving the show in limbo. The show began airing on HBO in 2016, before moving to HBO's streaming service in 2020. Warner Bros. Discovery will retain rights to the Sesame Street library through 2027.Sesame Workshop, which generates the majority of its revenue through licensing and distribution fees and royalties, has struggled financially in recent months. In March, Sesame Workshop's CEO told staff it would ""downsize significantly,"" citing the end of the HBO deal and the loss of federal funds as factors.Public media has been under fire of late, with President Trump seeking to end federal funding for PBS and National Public Radio. In his executive order signed earlier this month, Trump said ""neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""One of the longest-running shows on television, ""Sesame Street"" has aired more than 4,500 episodes since its debut in 1969. Since its inception, Sesame Street has focused on both entertaining and educating children.Major streaming services have changed their approach to children's entertainment in recent years, as they try to compete with YouTube. With ""Sesame Street,"" Netflix adds to its roster of children's programming that already includes ""Peppa Pig,"" ""Cocomelon,"" and ""Ms. Rachel.""The new episodes on Netflix will feature new segments and some format changes, including 11-minute, character-driven stories. There will be a new animated segment called ""Tales from 123"" about the apartment building where Elmo and Cookie Monster live.Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250519005919:0/
Netflix Could Get a Boost From Live Events. J.P. Morgan Downgraded It Anyway. — Barrons.com,1747674660000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix shares could continue to shine if the streaming company keeps hosting sporting events, but that didn't stop one J.P. Morgan analyst from downgrading the stock on Monday.Doug Anmuth downgraded the shares to Neutral from Overweight while also raising his price target to $1,220 from $1,150.""To be clear, there's no change to our long-term bullish view on NFLX's streaming leadership position & the company's potential to effectively become global TV over time,"" Anmuth wrote in a research note on Monday. ""However, more near-term, following significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, we believe the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced.""Shares of Netflix were down 0.6% on Monday to $1,184.75. The stock has surged 33% this year, far outperforming the 1% increase of the S&P 500 in 2025.Wall Street hasn't only been pleased with Netflix's performance over the last few quarters, but is also confident it can withstand economic turmoil.Netflix has been performing well because of the company's decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-price ad tier. The changes led to more people opening their own accounts and provided users with a cheaper option, which could prevent subscription cancellations if times get tough. Netflix has also introduced live events to its streaming platform, including comedy roasts and NFL games.""Live events/sports content could also drive strong engagement, ad dollars, & subscriber growth,"" Anmuth wrote.Netflix is hosting two NFL games on Christmas again this year. The 2024 Christmas games were the two most streamed NFL games in U.S. history, according to Netflix.A CNBC reporter also said on The Town podcast May 16 that he spoke to one of the co-CEOs of Netflix who ""admitted to me, like, 'Yeah, I talked to [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell on the side about adding even more games beyond our two Christmas games.'""Barron's has reached out to Netflix and the NFL for comment.But while Netflix investors may be excited about the idea of the company hosting more live events down the line, there are still risks to the stock.President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""There aren't many details, but increased costs could hurt margins and potentially push Netflix to raise prices. Netflix is also at risk of people trading down to lower-priced subscription offerings or canceling if tariffs take a bite out of their budgets. Data from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment fell to its second-lowest reading on record in May.Investors will have to decide whether to follow Anmuth's advice and wait on the sidelines, or bet on a streaming service that continues to outperform.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent. Higher yields tend to compress valuations for growth stocks, which rely on future earnings.Read more: Adani, Tata, Vedanta make a power play for coal-fired projects after five-year lullThe downbeat session came just after markets closed out a stellar week. Investors had cheered a breakthrough in trade negotiations, with the U.S. and China agreeing to pause tariff hikes, lifting global risk appetite. The Nasdaq had rallied over 7 percent last week, while the S&P 500 gained more than 5 percent over five straight sessions. The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone. Walmart shares slipped 1.7 percent after President Trump suggested the retailer should shoulder the burden of tariffs, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said CEO Doug McMillon had agreed to absorb some levies. Netflix dropped 2 percent after JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral, citing its sharp rally.

Netflix Rally Moves JPMorgan to Sideline — Market Talk,1747658460000,"JPMorgan says that ""following significant stock price appreciation & outperformance,"" it's lowering its rating on Netflix to neutral from overweight.

Netflix Cut to Neutral From Overweight by JP Morgan,1747654020000,(11:27 GMT) Netflix Price Target Raised to $1220.00/Share From $1150.00 by JP Morgan,https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250519003464:0/
"JPMorgan cuts Netflix rating, citing balanced risk-reward post-rally; stock falls",1747653114000,"Shares of Netflix fell over 2.3% in premarket trading Monday after JPMorgan downgraded the streaming giant to “neutral” from “overweight”, even as it raised its price target on the stock to $1,220 from $1,150. The new target implies a modest 2.38% upside from the company’s last close at $1,191.53. The company has also removed Netflix from the US Equity Analyst Focus List, it said.The downgrade comes despite JPMorgan reiterating its belief in Netflix’s long-term leadership in the global streaming industry and its potential to effectively become the world’s dominant TV platform. Few near-term catalysts; easing trade fears could shift focus: JPMorganNetflix shares have surged more than 34% so far in 2025, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Movies & Entertainment index, which has risen 20.87%. The stock also recently crossed the $500 billion market capitalization mark for the first time, underscoring investor confidence in the company’s business model and growth potential.However, the brokerage said the stock’s significant rally over recent months has made the risk/reward outlook more evenly balanced in the near term.Analysts said the sharp gains likely reflect much of the upside embedded in the company’s 2025 earnings guidance. As a result, they see limited near-term catalysts to drive the stock substantially higher.It also said that while the company’s shares have held up well, if concerns about tariffs and the broader economy continue to ease, investors may shift their focus to other internet stocks and market sectors that have been more vulnerable & pressured.A safe haven in a volatile marketNetflix’s recent stock gains have been attributed to its perceived immunity from tariff threats and economic uncertainty. The company imports entertainment, not physical goods, insulating it from the cost pressures that have hit other firms amid escalating trade tensions. Even when former President Donald Trump floated a 100% import duty on foreign films, Netflix stock fell just 2% as investors bet the company could adjust by shifting production to the US or raising subscription prices.Moreover, Netflix has historically performed well during periods of economic stress. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it posted double-digit gains as homebound users streamed popular titles.That history has made it a preferred choice among investors seeking stability.According to data compiled by LSEG, the average rating of 51 analysts on Netflix is a “buy”, with a median PT of $1,150.Valuation concerns begin to surfaceAt around 43 times forward earnings, Netflix’s valuation has become a topic of concern. It trades at a premium compared to the S&P 500’s multiple of 21 and even the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants, which average 27.However, the company has historically commanded a higher premium. Its average P/E ratio over the past five years stands at 52.Ben James, a strategist at Baillie Gifford’s US growth fund, told Barron’s that the stock’s transformation from a speculative content spender to a profitable business has justified its valuation. The firm, which owns roughly 4 million Netflix shares valued at $4.5 billion, remains optimistic that operating margins could nearly double from the current 27% to as high as 50% by 2030.“It’s invested so much in its own content that it’s built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,” James said. “When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it’s over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.”Looking ahead to 2030Executives are reportedly targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of the decade, according to The Wall Street Journal . While the company has surpassed the critical $500 billion mark, the it will need to sustain rapid earnings growth and margin expansion to hit that milestone. While short-term valuations may limit further gains, many investors remain focused on the long-term narrative that Netflix will continue to shape the future of global entertainment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:eeb6d554c094b:0-jpmorgan-cuts-netflix-rating-citing-balanced-risk-reward-post-rally-stock-falls/

Netflix Stock Is Still A Buy Despite Its Lofty Valuation — Barron's,1747445400000,"The shares were a tariff winner, and that won't change even with the China trade deal. By George GloverIn a market that has felt like a horror show for much of 2025, Netflix has been one of the few feel-good stories in town.The video streamer looks like the rare sort of stock that can outperform no matter what happens on the trade front. Its shares, at a recent $1,173.25, have jumped 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a brutal and broad selloff, while the S&P 500 index is up 4.1% over the same period. On Thursday, Netflix was less than $1 billion away from closing with a market value of $500 billion for the first time.It isn't hard to see why Netflix has become one of the market's go-to safe havens. It imports content, not goods, so there's little risk of the White House's reciprocal levies driving up its costs. Shares dipped just 2% the day Trump threatened to impose 100% import duties on foreign movies, as investors realized that the company could mitigate much of the earnings impact by either shifting production to the U.S. or raising its prices.The stock also has a pedigree as a name that can outperform in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, racking up double-digit gains during the Covid-19 pandemic as widespread lockdowns led to users plowing through smash-hit series like Tiger King and The Last Dance.But while other perceived havens like gold could struggle now that the Trump administration has brokered a deal with China to cut most tariffs for 90 days, Netflix ought to be able to build on its strong run this year.The only real mark against the stock right now is valuation. Due to the recent rally, shares aren't cheap — they currently fetch about 43 times future earnings, meaning they're trading at a significant premium to both the benchmark S&P 500, at 21 times, and the Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech names it's often compared with, at 27 times.Still, Netflix has averaged a price/earnings ratio of 52 over the past five years, so judging by recent history it isn't expensive. Over that time the stock has gone from ""a loss-making challenger where everyone was skeptical about how much it's spending on content to a reliable, profitable compounder,"" Ben James, a strategist at the Edinburgh-based investment management firm Baillie Gifford's U.S. growth fund, tells Barron's. The firm holds a little more than 4 million shares, a position that's valued at about $4.5 billion.The bull case hinges on the idea that the streamer will be able to grow earnings at a fast enough rate to maintain the stock's recent momentum. James argues that operating margins, currently at 27%, could nearly double by the end of 2030.He says that over the past decade, Netflix has managed to engineer a self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users. The streamer has already done the hard work, pouring money into creating a vast library of films and movies.""It's invested so much in its own content that it's built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,"" James says. ""When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it's over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.""Executives are targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, up from $484 billion right now. Even at Netflix's current lofty valuation, it would be all set to hit the 13-figure threshold if it could manage the necessary margin growth.The rollout of cheaper subscription plans could also help supercharge profit. Netflix unlocked a fresh revenue stream when it introduced ad-supported tiers in November 2022. Ads accounted for just 4% of revenue in 2024, but the company projects ad revenue to double this year, and its advertising president, Amy Reinhard, said Wednesday that the ad-supported tiers had added 24 million users over the past six months. James thinks the streamer will soon be able to leverage artificial intelligence to target users and make the tiers more profitable.Live sports programming could also help the streamer reach untapped markets. It might seem like every household has a Netflix account, but there's still plenty of room for the streamer to grow. For the fourth quarter of 2024, it reported 301.6 million subscribers globally. Three years ago, Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann estimated a total addressable market of between 700 million and 1 billion homes.Netflix might not even be a pure-play streamer for much longer. In February the company opened its first restaurant, Netflix Bites in Las Vegas, where fans can tuck into dishes inspired by well-known films and TV shows. It's also set to launch two experiential venues it's dubbed Netflix Houses sometime later this year.All that makes for a tempting growth story. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to rise 26% this year, another 20% in 2026, and then another 18% in 2027.Despite Netflix's stellar gains this year, investors shouldn't feel like they've missed the boat. Surging profit could quickly make the streamer look cheap again. Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for that.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515000044:0/

"These Stocks Moved the Most Today: UnitedHealth, Applied Materials, Novo Nordisk, Super Micro, Coinbase, Doximity, Quantum Computing, and More — Barrons.com",1747426200000,"By Joe Woelfel, Nate Wolf, and Connor SmithStocks rose Friday, as the S&P 500 closed higher every day this week. The gains came even as a preliminary reading in May of consumer sentiment declined for a fifth consecutive month.These stocks made moves:UnitedHealth rose 6.4% after tumbling 11% on Thursday to a 52-week low in response to a Wall Street Journal report that the Justice Department was investigating UnitedHealth for possible criminal Medicare fraud. On Tuesday, shares fell 18% after the company's CEO stepped down and UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 outlook. Shares have tumbled 42% this year.Applied Materials reported fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings that topped analysts' estimates, but shares of the largest chip-equipment maker in the world fell 5.3% after a disappointing revenue outlook. Applied Materials said it anticipates third-quarter revenue in a range that at the midpoint of $7.2 billion was slightly below consensus of $7.22 billion.U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, were down 2.7% following news that Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen would step down as CEO. Coming into Friday, Novo Nordisk's American depositary receipts had declined 50% over the past 12 months.Take-Two Interactive Software was down 2.4% as it posted a mixed fourth quarter and said it expects fiscal 2026 revenue of between $5.95 billion and $6.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $7.91 billion. The company said this month that publishing label Rockstar Games would delay the release of Grand Theft Auto VI to May 26, 2026.Super Micro Computer was up 5% on Friday. The stock has risen about 42% this week, but remains down more than 60% from its 52-week high.Charter Communications will acquire private broadband company Cox Communications in a deal with an enterprise value of $34.5 billion.

The company said it had taken another step toward launching an operational foundry, finishing construction of its Arizona-based factory during the quarter.Netflix rose 1.2% to build on its record close after the streaming service closed up 2.3% on Thursday. Netflix finished Friday with a market cap of $507 billion after crossing $500 billion for the first time on Thursday.Meta Platforms is delaying the rollout of a flagship artificial-intelligence model, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Engineers have been struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its large-language model, the people said. The stock fell 2.4% on Thursday and was down 0.6% on Friday.Shares of Coinbase gained 9% after the cryptocurrency exchange closed down 7.2% on Thursday after disclosing that it was the victim of a data breach that could cost up to $400 million, and after the New York Times reported on a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into possible misrepresentation of the company's user numbers. Wall Street analysts largely brushed off the negative headlines.Cava, the Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain, posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of 22 cents a share on revenue of $331.8 million, beating Wall Street estimates for profit of 14 cents and revenue of $326.8 million. Cava also raised its fiscal-year guidance for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $152 million to $159 million, and slightly increased expectations for new restaurants this year, to 64 to 68 additions. The stock declined 2.3%.Doximity sank 10% after the online medical platform reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue but forecast less revenue for its current quarter than expected. The company said it expects first-quarter revenue of $139 million to $140 million, below analysts' projections of $143.3 million. Doximity's fiscal-year revenue outlook also was shy of forecasts.Constellation Brands rose 2.6%.

3 Reasons Why Earnings Season Rocks ,1747418400000,"Imagine that, once every few months, you must release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.Sounds intimidating, right?That’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.The period is undoubtedly hectic for market participants, with companies finally revealing what’s transpired behind closed doors.And on top of being hectic, it’s impossible to understate the importance of the period. For those wondering why it’s so critical, let’s look at a few reasons that help explain its significance.1. Critical Business UpdatesEarnings reports provide market participants with a plethora of information, including revenues, expenses, and profits, just to provide a few simple examples.Take, for example, Palantir PLTR, which recently upped its current year revenue growth guidance, causing shares to soar post-earnings. PLTR has communicated that it’s been enjoying healthy demand thanks to the AI frenzy, reflected by the guidance upgrade.Analysts accordingly adjusted their current year sales expectations following the guidance upgrade, with the company now forecasted to see 35% YoY revenue growth.2. Share Price ImpactA company’s quarterly earnings report commonly impacts its stock price, a theme that market participants have undoubtedly noticed. Typically, we’ll see bullish share movement post-earnings from companies that surprise positively or raise their guidance, reflecting healthy underlying business.Netflix NFLX saw its shares soar following its latest quarterly print, with the company crushing on subscriber metrics while also posting 25% EPS growth on the back of 12% higher sales. As shown below, shares have soared following back-to-back releases.It’s worth noting that implementing a stop-loss at a comfortable threshold will help limit spooky post-earnings price swings, preserving precious capital.3. Highlights Current TrendsEarnings season can also provide a big-picture view of overall trends within the economy or industries. For a simple example, if many retail companies fall short of expectations, it could be a sign of a slowing consumer or economy, which has knock-on effects across the market.Conversely, if many retail companies report stronger-than-expected earnings, it may signal that the economy is moving along just fine, underpinned by a healthy consumer.It also allows investors to position themselves appropriately. For example, Newmont NEM, one of the world's largest producers of gold, has benefited significantly from the rise in gold, which was reflected in its latest quarterly print.The average gold price per oz reached $2,643 throughout Newmont’s latest period, melting higher from the $2,004 mark in the same period last year. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion throughout the period was the company’s highest read ever.Analysts have raised their EPS expectations across the board amid the favorable operating environment, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares overall reflect a great way to obtain exposure to the recent run in gold.Bottom LineWhile earnings season is undeniably hectic for everyone involved, that’s just the nature of the period.It’s important for investors to understand why it matters for many reasons, including providing investors with an updated financial standing, the volatile post-earnings share swings, and the overall picture it provides on market and broader trends.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7d5ebe7a7094b:0-3-reasons-why-earnings-season-rocks/

Netflix vs. Paramount Global: Which Streaming Provider is a Better Buy?,1747401840000,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of entertainment streaming, Netflix NFLX and Paramount Global PARA represent two distinct approaches to capturing audience attention and market share. Netflix, the pioneer that transformed how we consume content, has evolved into a global powerhouse with more than 300 million paid households. Paramount Global, born from the merger of ViacomCBS, combines traditional media assets with streaming ambitions through Paramount+.Both companies are navigating similar challenges: intensifying competition, evolving consumer preferences, and the need to balance content investments with profitability. As streaming becomes the dominant form of entertainment consumption, investors are increasingly scrutinizing which media companies can deliver sustainable growth and returns in this new paradigm.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for NFLX StockNetflix has demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation in the first quarter of 2025, posting impressive results that highlight its dominant position in the streaming wars. Revenues grew 13% year over year to $10.5 billion, while operating income surged 27% to $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects Netflix's successful execution of its strategic priorities, which include improving content offerings and growing its advertising business.The company's content strategy continues to deliver results, with breakthrough originals like Adolescence , which became the third most popular English-language series ever with 124 million views. Netflix's international expansion is equally impressive, with significant investments in local content production across 50 countries. This global approach has paid dividends, as evidenced by the company's U.K. success, where it has captured 9% of TV viewing time, trailing only BBC and ITV.Netflix's upcoming content pipeline further strengthens its investment case. The second quarter features high-profile films like Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Straw with Taraji P. Henson and Havoc featuring Tom Hardy. The highly anticipated final season of Squid Game , Netflix's most popular series ever, debuts on Jun. 27, 2025, accompanied by updates to the related games experience, showcasing Netflix's cross-platform content monetization strategy.Netflix's financial discipline stands out as a particular strength. The company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow for the first quarter, demonstrating its ability to convert growth into tangible returns for shareholders. Management has also set ambitious but achievable targets, including doubling revenues by 2030 and achieving $9 billion in annual advertising revenues by the same year. The company's advertising business represents a significant growth opportunity, with the successful launch of Netflix's Ad Suite in the United States on April 1 and international expansion planned for this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025, creating a new revenue stream that complements its successful subscription model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.47 billion, indicating 14.01% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.33 per share, indicating 27.74% growth year over year. Netflix, Inc. Price and ConsensusNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for PARA StockParamount Global has been struggling to transform itself amid significant challenges. While the company posted revenues of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, this represented a 6% decline year over year, even when excluding the impact of the prior year's Super Bowl broadcast. The company's TV Media segment, which still accounts for the largest portion of revenues, saw a concerning 13% decrease.Despite reaching 79 million Paramount+ subscribers, the Direct-to-Consumer segment continues to operate at a loss of $109 million. Although this represents an improvement of $177 million year over year, it pales in comparison to Netflix's profitability and scale. Additionally, Paramount+ faces subscriber growth challenges, with management warning about expected subscriber declines in the second quarter due to content seasonality and the termination of an international hard bundle partnership.Paramount Global's content strategy appears unfocused compared with Netflix, spreading investments across traditional broadcast, cable networks, film, and streaming. While the company celebrates shows like Landman and 1923 , it lacks the consistent hit ratio of Netflix. The company also faces monetization challenges with Pluto TV, its free ad-supported service, where increased supply in digital video has pressured advertising revenues.The uncertain Skydance merger further complicates Paramount Global's investment case. Though management confirmed the transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2025, this pending deal creates uncertainty about future strategic direction. Questions also remain about the treatment of voting shareholders in the transaction, as highlighted by recent legal challenges from GAMCO Investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PARA’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.32 per share, indicating a 14.29% decrease year over year. The consensus estimate for 2025 revenues is pinned at $28.43 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 2.67%.Paramount Global Price and ConsensusParamount Global price-consensus-chart | Paramount Global QuoteStock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonNetflix currently trades at a premium valuation compared to Paramount Global, but the disparity appears justified given the companies' divergent financial trajectories. Netflix's price-to-earnings ratio of 43.21x reflects investors' confidence in its sustainable growth model, robust free cash flow generation, and clear path to increased profitability. In contrast, PARA's lower valuation multiple of 7.48x signals market skepticism about its ability to successfully navigate the transition to streaming.NFLX vs. PARA: P/E F12M RatioStock performance tells a similar story. Netflix shares have shown strong momentum, trading near all-time highs and significantly outperforming both the broader market and the entertainment sector. Paramount Global shares, meanwhile, have underperformed, weighed down by concerns about linear TV decline, streaming profitability challenges and transaction uncertainty.Shares of NFLX have surged 32.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming PARA and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.NFLX Outperforms PARA, Sector YTDNetflix's solid balance sheet, with $7.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, provides flexibility for content investments and shareholder returns. Paramount Global, despite generating $123 million in free cash flow in the first quarter, faces greater financial constraints and uncertainty about future capital allocation priorities.ConclusionNetflix emerges as the superior investment choice in the streaming wars based on its robust financial performance, strategic clarity, and execution capabilities. While Paramount struggles with declining legacy businesses and unprofitable streaming operations, Netflix continues to innovate and expand its dominance globally. NFLX's superior content strategy, successful advertising initiatives, and impressive cash flow generation create a compelling investment case. Investors should consider buying Netflix for its long-term growth prospects and potential for increased shareholder returns, while approaching Paramount Global with caution given its structural challenges and uncertain future. In the battle for streaming supremacy, Netflix has established itself as the safer and more promising investment bet. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas PARA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:14747e805094b:0-netflix-vs-paramount-global-which-streaming-provider-is-a-better-buy/

Netflix May Rerate on Accelerating Ad Revenues,1747398934000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX wins bullish reviews after its ad-supported tier hit 94 million monthly active usersup more than 20 million since November and soaring from 40 million in May 2024highlighting accelerating monetization of its $7.99 ad plan versus the $17.99 ad-free entry point.Evercore's Mark Mahaney reiterated a Buy rating with a $1,150 price target following Netflix's annual Upfront Presentation, where management showcased the ad tech platform rollout and new viewership data, while noting that ad viewers now watch 41 hours/month on AVOD. BMO Capital's Brian Pitz also stuck with Buy and a $1,200 target, citing positive second-half 2025 monetization tailwinds from the upcoming Ad Suite launch in EMEA and a planned 2026 rollout of AI-powered ad formats. Seaport Research's David Joyce lifted his target to $1,230, praising Netflix's in-house ad capabilities and flexibility across formats even as subscription price hikes and membership growth continue to underpin the majority of revenue. The FT-reported upgrades reflect growing confidence that Netflix can parlay ad traction into material revenue, offsetting subscriber-growth plateaus in mature markets. Analyst commentary underscored that with advertising now accounting for a growing share of overall ARPU, Netflix may unlock a multi-year ad-revenue catalyst. Why it matters: stronger ad-tier engagement and rising price targets suggest Netflix's valuation could re-rate as investors price in incremental revenue from AVOD.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:880dcb7e4094b:0-netflix-may-rerate-on-accelerating-ad-revenues/
Netflix Stock Gets a Price-Target Hike. Why It Still Has Upside After a Great Run. — Barrons.com,1747394880000,"By George GloverNetflix is on a stellar run — but the video streamer's shares could still have upside thanks to their tariff resilience and new series of Stranger Things and Bridgerton.That's the view of Seaport Research Partners analyst David Joyce, who rates the red-hot tech stock at a Buy. He raised his price target to $1,230 from $1,060 Thursday — that implies shares could rise about 4.4% from their current level.Those aren't eye-popping gains, but Joyce said he sees Netflix as more of ""a core holding with limited downside"" and ""a good buy-on-the-dip candidate."" He expects the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to jump 14% to $15.24 billion between the start of this year and the end of 2026, citing a slate of new content, the success of the streamer's ad-supported tiers, and subscription price hikes.Joyce added that the stock's ""recession-resilience during the spring market turbulence"" should also boost their appeal. The stock is up about 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a broad and brutal market selloff. Investors see it as a safe haven because Netflix imports content, rather than goods. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 5% over the same period.This week, Barron's argued that Netflix stock remains a Buy despite its lofty valuation, with its margin likely to grow at a fast enough rate to maintain momentum.The streamer's own executives are also targeting further gains. They're aiming to double revenue and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter. As of Thursday's close, Netflix had a market capitalization of just over $500 billion.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Netflix says ad-supported service has 94 million subscribers,1747254290000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX said on Wednesday 94 million subscribers use its advertising-supported tier, up from 70 million in November, as the video-streaming giant's lower-priced plan sees strong support amid global economic uncertainty.With more than 300 million global customers, Netflix is seeing robust spending across all streaming tiers and had said in April it is not seeing any significant shifts in consumer spending. The comments allayed investor concerns that economic uncertainty due to the shifting U.S. trade policy would prompt consumers to cut discretionary spending on streaming services.Netflix had last month said the ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available.To attract more global users, Netflix rolled out enhanced language options for television viewers earlier this year, offering more dubbing and subtitle options. Many of Netflix's most popular media are foreign-made such as South Korean drama ""Squid Game"" and Spanish series ""Money Heist"".Foreign-made films were threatened with a 100% tariff by President Donald Trump in May in an attempt to boost domestic productions, clouding the outlook for media firms such as Netflix, which film overseas.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM13P:0-netflix-says-ad-supported-service-has-94-million-subscribers/"
Warner Bros Discovery revives HBO Max branding for global push,1747236010000,"Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD is hitting rewind on Max's branding, bringing back the HBO name it dropped from the streaming service two years ago.The company will rebrand its streaming platform as HBO Max this summer, betting that the iconic brand's global reputation will drive subscriber growth as it expands internationally.The return to HBO Max also marks an ""implicit promise"" by the company to deliver unique and premium content, WBD said on Wednesday. HBO is home to some of the most popular, critically-acclaimed series including ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Detective."" ""Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead,"" CEO David Zaslav said.WBD's decision to drop HBO from HBO Max in 2023 followed its move to merge HBO dramas and top franchises like ""Harry Potter"" with lifestyle-focused content from Discovery under one service.The goal was to offer a more appealing product and to help retain viewers who typically canceled their subscriptions after watching the latest season of their favorite show.But it saw strong backlash from audiences. Even Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , called the move a surprise. ""I would have never guessed HBO would have gone away. They put all that effort into one thing that they can tell the consumer - it should be HBO,"" he said in a Variety interview in March. Streaming has become a major growth area for WBD as its cable TV business suffers from cord-cutting. Shows including ""The White Lotus"" and ""The Pitt"" helped it amass 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the January-March quarter, taking its total to 122.3 million. The company expects its subscriber base to exceed 150 million by the end of 2026. A key driver of that growth has been international expansion. After rolling out Max in over 70 countries last year, WBD plans to launch the service in the UK, Ireland, Italy and Germany.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RM1EJ:0-warner-bros-discovery-revives-hbo-max-branding-for-global-push/"

3 Reasons Why Disney Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q2 Earnings Beat,1747139040000,"Disney DIS delivered impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues, demonstrating strong momentum across its business segments. (Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)With shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.Impressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic ExecutionDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.These results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.The Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.Direct-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share. These projections suggest steady growth ahead.(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Streaming Profitability Achieved as Content Drives GrowthAfter years of heavy investment in its streaming platforms, Disney has successfully navigated the challenging transition from traditional media to direct-to-consumer models. The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.Disney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.The company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash . These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.Disney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.Shares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+. While Netflix has returned 24.5% year to date, shares of Amazon and Apple have lost 4.9% and 15.85%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceMultiple Growth Catalysts on the HorizonLooking ahead, Disney has several compelling growth catalysts that should drive shareholder value in the coming years.In sports, ESPN delivered its most-watched second quarter in primetime ever, with viewership among the key 18-49 demographic up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by marquee events like the USA/Canada 4 Nations Championship and Women's College Basketball, which saw its most-watched regular season in 16 years.The company is preparing to launch ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, which should further strengthen its position as the preeminent digital sports platform.Meanwhile, the Experiences segment delivered strong results, with Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income growing 13% compared to the prior-year quarter. At Disney Cruise Line, the Disney Treasure is now in its second full quarter of operations, with two more cruise ships joining the fleet later this year.Most impressive is Disney's unprecedented pipeline of expansion projects around the world, creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California. This includes special celebrations for Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary and Disneyland's historic 70th anniversary.The Bottom Line: Disney Offers Compelling Value at a DiscountBased on its strong second-quarter results and improved outlook, Disney stock appears significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company currently trades at just 19.25 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings, notably below the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry average of 21.37 times. This valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a premium media brand.DIS’ 3-Year P/E TTM Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationManagement has confidently raised guidance for fiscal 2025, now expecting adjusted EPS of approximately $5.75, representing a 16% increase over fiscal 2024. The company also projects approximately $17 billion in cash provided by operations, suggesting a $2 billion increase over prior guidance. This robust cash flow enables continued investments in growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through the company's share repurchase program.ConclusionWith its streaming services now profitable, box office hits driving multi-channel revenues, significant expansion projects underway in the Parks segment, and a valuation below industry averages, Disney offers investors exposure to multiple growth vectors with increasingly solid financial fundamentals. For investors looking for a blue-chip media and entertainment company with both defensive characteristics and growth potential, DIS stock appears to be a compelling buy at current levels. Disney currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Jon Voight, Hollywood coalition asks Trump to consider tax incentives",1747086230000,"A coalition of American film industry unions and guilds, joined by veteran actor Jon Voight, has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to consider implementing tax incentives in his push to promote domestic film productions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. Along with Voight, the letter was signed by Sylvester Stallone and Teamsters union general president Sean O'Brien, among others. They call for Trump to support the inclusion of three film-friendly tax measures in a reconciliation package being drafted in Congress. Voight and Stallone were also appointed by Trump as special ambassadors to Hollywood to strengthen the industry and bring filmmaking back to the country.""Returning more production to the United States will require a national approach and broad-based policy solutions, including those we propose below as well as longer term initiatives such as implementing a federal film and television tax incentive,"" the letter read. Major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain as governments around the world introduce credits and rebates to attract film productions. Trump threw the entertainment industry into a flux earlier this month when he announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering.The move left a lot of questions unanswered, such as when the duties would be implemented and how they would be enforced — as different components of a film are made in different countries and then assembled through post-production. Trump's tariff pronouncement followed his meeting with Voight along with other executives and advisers to mull a range of ideas to to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1SD:0-jon-voight-hollywood-coalition-asks-trump-to-consider-tax-incentives/"
Tesla to Debut Self-Driving Taxi in June as Robotaxi Wars Begin,1747080000000,"Disrupt or be DisruptedTechnological advances are always at the heart of disruption on Wall Street, and thus, the most profitable long-term trend opportunities. However, it will mean a slow, painful death for companies who fail to adapt and evolve. Conversely, the rewards are substantial for companies that respond to market changes and debut new technologies. For instance, Blockbuster Video did little to adapt when Netflix ( NFLX ) first began its mail-order DVD service (which later morphed into a streaming service). The result? Blockbuster went bust, and Netflix would become one of the best-performing stocks of the 2000s.Why Robotaxis are Taking OverOver the past few months, the idea of autonomous vehicles has gone from dream to reality. Advancements in artificial intelligence, software, cameras, and sensors have made this possible. Robotaxis provide several benefits, including:- Safety: Drive on the road for more than a half hour in any major US city and you are likely to witness at least one driver glancing down at their Apple ( AAPL ) Pphone. Robotaxis promise to reduce human error and distraction, reducing the number of accidents. - Cost Reduction: By eliminating the need for human drivers, ride-hailing operators can become far more profitable. - More Vehicles: Because robotaxis don’t need to take breaks like humans (outside of recharging), they can run nearly 24/7, increasing the number of vehicles on the road, improving customer wait times while increasing profitability.The Robotaxi Wars are HereThus far, Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) “Waymo” service is the undisputed king of robotaxis. Waymo is the first major robotaxi player to gain regulatory clearance, operates in four US cities (with plans to add two more), and its paid robotaxi business has exploded to more than 250,000 paid rides per week. Meanwhile, Waymo has inked a strategic partnership with Uber Technologies ( UBER ), operator of the most-extensive ride-sharing application and network.Tesla Will Enter the Robotaxi Market in JuneWhile Tesla ( TSLA ) and its visionary CEO Elon Musk, are behind in the robotaxi wars, the race to robotaxi supremacy is in the early innings. Musk has said several times over that past few years that he is “betting the company” on autonomous vehicle technology and believes that robotaxis will revolutionize transportation and potentially increase the value of a Tesla by fivefold. Though Tesla’s robotaxi debut has been delayed several times, Tesla has finally begun testing its robotaxi service with employees in Austin, Texas. Next month, Tesla will start to roll out its robotaxi to customers through its in-house built mobile application.Waymo vs. Tesla: Who Will Win the Robotaxi War? Waymo has an early advantage in the robotaxi war. While Tesla has yet to launch, Waymo is a proven entity that is well on its way to reaching scale. That said, it is far too early to count Tesla out. A critical difference between Waymo and Tesla robotaxis is cost. Waymo autonomous vehicles are far more expensive than Tesla robotaxis. Because Waymo leverages expensive LiDAR, radar, cameras, and AI, it can cost about $180,000! Conversely, Tesla robotaxis will only rely on computer vision AI, costing about $50,000 to produce.Image Source: @teslaownersvIn other words, while Tesla is behind in the robotaxi race, its lower cost could allow it to catch up in scale and also enjoy jucier profit margins in the long run.Bottom LineWhile Waymo currently holds a significant lead, Tesla’s impending entry (with game-changing cost advantage) injects uncertainty into the future landscape of autonomous transportation. It means the robotaxi wars may just be starting.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:aba92c91b094b:0-tesla-to-debut-self-driving-taxi-in-june-as-robotaxi-wars-begin/

But he flagged doubts about how many streaming services the market could sustain.In the March quarter, more advertisers turned to the owner of FOX News, FOX Sports and Tubi to tap its growing viewership. An estimated 127.7 million viewers tuned in for the Super Bowl championship broadcast by Fox, the largest audience in TV history for a single-network telecast.

New Tariffs Hit Film Industry—What It Means for Netflix,1747048500000,"There are no clear-cut answers in today’s uncertain stock market, as President Trump's recently rolled-out trade tariffs start to hit industries that weren’t considered targets for these trading headwinds. When the announcements started, the attention seemed to be centered on the  technology sector , specifically the semiconductor and chipmaking industry in Asian regions. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] However, these tariffs quickly spilled over into the retail sector and, most recently, into entertainment . As some countries have made little effort to work around a deal with the United States, President Trump has come up with more creative ways to force the market into negotiations, with his latest strategic round of tariffs focused on the movie industry . After announcing a 100% tariff on foreign-made films , all eyes suddenly turned to one stock.Shares of Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on a tear for the entire year, as investors believe that this subscription business could outweigh the volatility brought on by trade tariffs due to its fundamental strengths and the ability of management and analysts to forecast earnings and revenues into the future, aiding in better outlooks and valuations in the future. Here are some angles investors can consider for Netflix on this new development.Price Action: Netflix’s Latest SeriesOver the past 12 months, Netflix's stock delivered a massive 88.8% rally to outperform most of its peers and the broader S&P 500 . This reiterates the fact that as volatility and uncertainty hit the broader financial markets, Netflix was able to attract the attention and preference of investors due to its value proposition .However, over the past week, Netflix stock declined by as much as 4% on the news of these 100% movie tariffs . Even with this adverse reaction initially, there are a few things to consider for the future of the stock that might create more stability and positive outlooks in the coming months and quarters.Costs should be kept front and center when strategizing the potential scenarios that might come from these 100% tariffs, but here’s where the broader market participants think the stock could go next. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:NFLX] Institutions Are Okay With Uncertainty; Here’s WhyEven as Netflix's costs are set to rise , since a growing share of series and movies are produced internationally, not to mention a growing base of foreign users, there seems to be one clear advantage that Netflix can implement in the face of this new situation it has found itself in.With such a massive presence in the entertainment industry, not to mention its large market share and growing footprint across the globe , Netflix has a few ways to get around these new tariffs. One of the first, but not so obvious, is that Netflix can simply insource production in the United States for foreign creators to avoid some of these tariffs.Doing this would absolutely help the company in two ways. First, it can offset some of the significant added costs associated with importing foreign films. Second, it can gain political goodwill by bringing more production and exposure to the American scenery. This would mean added investment in the country , which might bring on potential grants and credits . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] That one can be a little complicated because it rests on many assumptions and multiple-choice options for the company and other producers. A more straightforward strategy might come from the brand’s leverage and pricing power , avoiding some of the hoops that need to be jumped through to onshore production and further logistics.This simpler alternative is to  raise prices , which might be seen as negative at first because the initial assumption is that higher prices will lower future demand. However, when investors zoom out, it isn’t just Netflix that has this problem; it is pretty much all the others in the entertainment industry .Knowing this, it becomes a race to see who is first to raise prices and lock in the additional audience before everyone else is either forced to take on the logistical onshoring or raise prices to avoid such heavy lifting. With both scenarios pointing to a Netflix win , it’s no surprise that some of the largest institutions warm up to owning more Netflix stock.Such as those from Natixis Advisors , who decided to boost their holdings in Netflix stock by 1% as of May 2025. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, it did bring the group’s net position to a high of $520.4 million today , giving investors another sign of confidence in the future , one that might be filled with one of these two assumptions moving forward.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:e3d26e2e5094b:0-new-tariffs-hit-film-industry-what-it-means-for-netflix/
Tariff uncertainty clouds outlook for US television's annual ad-selling bonanza,1747044000000,"The risk of a tariff-induced U.S. recession is hanging over the television industry's annual upfront selling season, when companies stage star-studded pitches to coax brands to commit to spending billions of dollars on advertising in the year ahead. Starting Monday, the presentations in New York kick off weeks of negotiations in which television networks and streaming services typically lock in the largest share of their ad revenue for the year. YouTube NASDAQ:GOOG promises a performance by Lady Gaga and an appearance from one of its biggest stars, Mr. Beast. NBCUniversal will host its presentation at Radio City Music Hall and Warner Bros. Discovery NASDAQ:WBD at Madison Square Garden.But the champagne-fueled parties will take place against a backdrop of economic concerns, stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies, which economists warn may lead to a recession. While major media companies have not reported any decline in ad demand, industry analysts predict brands will reduce their spending as consumer confidence wanes.Research firm eMarketer projects ad spending on traditional television during the upfronts could fall to $13.4 billion, down $4 billion from last year, depending on the level of tariffs that take effect. The Trump administration is negotiating deals with a number of major trading partners, including China.For digital ads on online devices, the worst-case scenario is that spending will stay flat at around $13 billion, eMarketer said. If tariffs are limited, digital ads could rise to $14.7 billion.Data firm Guideline said a pullback was already evident. Ad spending rose 7% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2024, but future bookings suggest growth could decelerate to 3% in the second quarter, Guideline said. Media executives acknowledged some brands might feel nervous, but said there could be a cost to cutting ad spending.""Clients learned some important lessons during COVID, when a lot of advertisers pulled back very quickly and then had to redeploy those funds,"" said Jeff Collins, president of advertising sales, marketing and brand partnerships at Fox NASDAQ:FOX . ""And I think that they're trying not to have a knee-jerk reaction to what is happening now.""Advertisers that wait to purchase time at the last minute in the so-called ""scatter"" market sometimes pay double-digit percentage increases in rates, Collins said.Fox had not yet seen any impact on ad demand from tariffs, he added. Karen Kovacs, president of advertising sales and partnerships at NBCUniversal, said brands that continued to spend on advertising during past downturns maintained better sales and market share than others that cut back. NBCU parent Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA , in its latest earnings report, said ad revenue was roughly flat during the first three months of 2025. BUYER'S MARKETSellers of ad time may need to give concessions on pricing and cancellation terms to win business, said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes, adding tariffs would have most impact on the advertising of physical products like cars and consumer goods.Digital players like Google's YouTube or Facebook parent Meta NASDAQ:META will likely emphasize the use of artificial intelligence to help brands reach customers more efficiently, said Greg Kahn, CEO of GK Digital Ventures media advisory firm.Many U.S. companies have cut or withdrawn their annual forecasts, citing an uncertain trade environment, including General Motors NYSE:GM , Kraft Heinz NASDAQ:KHC and bleach maker Clorox NYSE:CLX .Clorox is evaluating how much it spends on advertising, CEO Linda Rendle said on an earnings call last week.""We're going to continue to invest strongly in our brands, but at what level makes the most amount of sense given the returns that we're getting,"" Rendle said. Still, some media firms remain upbeat.Disney NYSE:DIS expects annual advertising growth to surpass its previous 3% forecast, while Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX co-CEO Greg Peters said in April the company was not seeing any signs of softness in its pre-upfronts discussions.The company does not disclose ad revenue, but analysts polled by LSEG project Netflix will bring in $2.7 billion from advertising in 2025. Netflix launched its ad-supported options in November 2022 and is still in the early stages of building that business. ""That smallness probably provides us some insulation to market shifts right now,"" Peters said, adding that Netflix expects to double ad revenue this year.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3R116L:0-tariff-uncertainty-clouds-outlook-for-us-television-s-annual-ad-selling-bonanza/"
Netflix Wins Praise From Top Analyst for AI-Powered TV Interface Overhaul,1746813995000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX drew investor attention Friday after a well-known analyst backed the streaming platform's redesign of its TV interface, calling it a potential driver of stronger engagement and revenue.The platform's upgraded TV app now offers real-time, personalized recommendations based on a user's viewing and search habits. BMO Capital's five-star analyst Brian Pitz reaffirmed a ""Buy"" rating on the stock, highlighting how these updates could improve viewer retention, increase content discovery, and help drive advertising revenue.Pitz also pointed to Netflix's use of AI across both TV and mobile to enhance content suggestions. He said the more interactive format could support a broader user base and deepen customer stickiness.Addressing potential pressure from Trump-era tariffs on foreign-made content, Pitz said Netflix's diversified library and production footprint, spanning over 50 countries, could reduce exposure to those trade risks.In its most recent quarter, Netflix reported strong revenue growth, with Asia-Pacific up 23% year over year and EMEA rising 15%. Cost discipline also supported margins, with marketing expenses falling to $688 million from $976 million in the prior quarter.Shares of Netflix were down slightly in afternoon trading.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8367f4ebc094b:0-netflix-wins-praise-from-top-analyst-for-ai-powered-tv-interface-overhaul/
Netflix (NFLX) Overhauls TV Experience With Global UI Rollout,1746743283000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) is giving its TV app a major makeover. The update, rolling out globally over the next few months, is built to help users find something to watchfaster and more intuitively.There's no revenue figure tied to the redesign, but it could help Netflix improve how long people stay on the appand what they choose to watch next.The revamped homepage now shows a big banner right up top with a recommended title. Scroll down and you'll see rows like Your Next Watch or Only on Netflix, all based on what you've seen, searched, or even which trailers you've clicked.Content tiles are getting labels like Emmy Award Winner or Recently Added to give users more context before hitting play. Netflix also moved its navigation barwhat used to be tucked to the side is now placed across the top for easier browsing.The redesign isn't just about looks. It's meant to lay the groundwork for where Netflix is heading next: live programming and TV-streamed games. Both are areas the company is quietly investing in, and this interface gives it room to highlight them front and center.The company is also using more personalized data signals. For example, if a viewer searches for rom coms and Glenn Powell, the homepage could dynamically shift to highlight both.On mobile, a TikTok-style vertical video feed is also being testedanother sign Netflix is experimenting with how people discover content.This UI refresh may seem cosmetic, but it signals a deeper bet: that a smarter, cleaner interface will keep Netflix ahead in a crowded streaming landscape.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:62eb9e1ba094b:0-netflix-nflx-overhauls-tv-experience-with-global-ui-rollout/

Disney Stock Soars After Earnings. Why It's All About Abu Dhabi and Theme Parks. — Barrons.com,1746643560000,"By George Glover and Angela PalumboDisney stock was soaring Wednesday after the company beat Wall Street's earnings target and unveiled a plan to build a theme park in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.The House of Mouse reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.45 a share and revenue rose 7% from a year ago to $23.6 billion. Analysts expected an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.1 billion, according to a FactSet poll.In afternoon trading, shares jumped 9.7% to $101.15. The stock was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.2%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.Revenue for Disney's experiences segment, which includes its theme parks, rose 6% from a year ago to $8.9 billion. The Street was looking for $8.7 billion. The solid parks revenue growth could help to reassure investors, who had been fretting that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive up inflation and lead to Americans spending less on big-ticket items like vacations.Shortly after it posted earnings, the company announced it would build a park on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. It would be the company's seventh park and first in the Middle East.""This groundbreaking resort destination represents a new frontier in theme park development,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the company's experiences division, said in a statement. ""Our resort in Abu Dhabi will be the most advanced and interactive destination in our portfolio.""The theme park, according to Disney's 10-Q filing, will be built and operated by Miral, a limited liability corporation in the UAE.Disney will license its intellectual property to Miral and will earn royalties based on the project's revenue. Disney didn't rdisclose a launch date or size of the theme park, according to the 10-Q filing.Miral, according to Disney, has developed several family destinations on Yas Island with American and European brands.""It is all their capital and we will get a royalty. So there isn't ownership. We own our IP and license it to them as essentially the arrangement,"" Disney management said on the earnings call.Disney runs its Japanese theme parks similarly. According to the company's most recent annual 10-K filing, Disney earns royalties on revenues generated by the Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land, a third-party Japanese corporation.Disney's streaming division, which includes the Disney+ platform, added 2.5 million subscribers over the quarter ended March 31. Its operating profit rose to $336 million, up from $47 million a year earlier.Disney said it was expecting adjusted earnings of $5.75 a share for its current fiscal year, which ends in September, although it noted that it will be monitoring macroeconomic developments that could shift its outlook. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of $5.43 for the current fiscal year.The earnings beat ought to give the stock a much-needed boost. Disney stock has declined 8.9% in 2025, compared with a 4.9% drop for the S&P 500.

Disney's Tariff Resilience Is a Surprise - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1746633600000,"By Dan GallagherThe Magic Kingdom hasn't lost its charm-even amid a trade war.Disney's share price jumped Wednesday morning after the entertainment giant posted surprisingly strong quarterly results. These included better-than-expected growth for its U.S. theme parks division, its biggest profit driver. Domestic parks operating income of $1.8 billion was 10% ahead of expectations, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.Investors had worried about Disney's exposure to the wide swath of tariffs unveiled by President Trump last month. Among other concerns, the announcements sparked fears of a sharp downtick in leisure travel, especially for visitors to the U.S. Trump's threat earlier this week to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. didn't help matters.Prior to Wednesday's report, Disney's share price was down nearly 6% from Trump's tariff unveiling on April 2, versus a 22% surge by Hollywood rival Netflix. Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino said Disney was ""priced like the sky is falling"" in an April 21 report.Wednesday report offered reassurance. Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said bookings for Disney World in Florida were up on the year for the quarters ending in June and September.Disney's Experiences business is also a global one, not just dependent on U.S. tourism. This was underscored by the surprise announcement of a new theme park in Abu Dhabi.

Amazon to spend $4 billion on cloud infrastructure in Chile,1746623400000,"Amazon's cloud computing division will invest $4 billion to build its first data centers and other cloud infrastructure in Chile, the company's head of South Latin America told Reuters.Amazon Web Services (AWS) expects the cloud region, its third in Latin America after Brazil and Mexico, to be operational by the second half of 2026.In an interview in Santiago on Tuesday, local head of AWS Juan Pablo Estevez said all the necessary permits had been given for the project, which would deliver ""substantial"" computing power for services like generative AI.The surge of data centers globally has caused concerns over energy and water use, which have been amplified in Chile as the country has suffered a drought for more than 15 years.Environmental concerns forced Google to rework plans for a $200 million data center in Chile after a local environmental court partially reversed its permit last September.Microsoft expects its cloud-computing Azure center in Chile to come online this year, according to its website. Estevez said Amazon's cloud region would use water to cool its servers just 4% of the year, the equivalent of about eight homes over a 15-year period, with air and evaporation technology used the rest of the time.He added that Amazon has been matching 100% of its energy consumption with renewable power since 2023.The company already has 36 regions and 114 availability zones worldwide used by companies such as Netflix, General Electric and Sony for storage, networking and remote security.Chilean retailer Cencosud, online retail giant MercadoLibre, and mining companies already use the company's other regional services, it said.Amazon's first-quarter cloud revenue and income forecast came in below estimates last Thursday, but Estevez said he's expecting strong growth in Chile and across the region.""The forecast is that the (Chile's) market will grow 20.3% year over year from now until 2028,"" he said, adding that the market was $1.5 billion last year and estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2025.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RE0UJ:0-amazon-to-spend-4-billion-on-cloud-infrastructure-in-chile/"

Trump's movie tariff threat alarms India's film makers,1746605200000,"India's film industry, which earns roughly 40% of its overseas revenue from the United States, sounded the alarm this week about higher costs after President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of 100% on all movies produced beyond American soil.Film makers, producers and distributors in one of the world's largest film industries by output struggled to weigh the likely impact of such a tariff as Trump provided scant details, stirring more questions than answers.""The real question is how the term 'foreign produced' will be defined, and until that's clear, it's hard to say anything,"" said film maker Anubhav Sinha, known for his Netflix streaming series, ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"". ""It's not yet clear whether services like post-production will be affected.""India's film industry employs 272,000 people, with overseas box office takings of about 20 billion rupees ($237 million) in fiscal 2024, or a tenth of total earnings, Deloitte and studio grouping the Motion Picture Association said in a report.Key Hollywood films with India scenes are Oscar-winners such as the rags-to-riches tale ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and the Osama bin Laden manhunt thriller, ""Zero Dark Thirty"", along with rom-com ""Eat, Pray Love"", and Batman outing ""The Dark Knight Rises"". In the absence of details on the planned levy, film producers worry it could double the cost of exporting their films to the United States, where people of Indian descent are estimated to number 5.2 million.""The United States is one of the most important overseas markets for Indian cinema, largely due to the substantial diaspora,"" said producer Madhu Bhojwani, reponsible for hits such as ""Airlift"", on workers evacuated from Kuwait during the Gulf War. ""Any increase in ticket prices resulting from these tariffs would directly affect audience turnout, compounding the challenges posed by evolving consumer behaviour and broader industry headwinds.""The cost-effective South Asian nation has also grown in stature as Hollywood's preferred hub for on-ground production and post-production services, especially in visual effects, since it offers a skilled talent pool.""Almost 10 to 15 (foreign) movies are shot in India every year, and our movie industry will be impacted very badly,"" said film trade analyst Komal Nahta. LIKELY HIT TO REVENUEProminent Indian actor and producer Prakash Raj called Trump's move ""tariff terrorism"".If the tariff covers post-production services, the consequences will be bigger, added Bhojwani, the co-founder of Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures.""We can expect a potential decline in outsourced work from U.S. studios to Indian vendors, which could have notable implications for the Indian media services sector,"" she said. ""If revenue from the U.S. drops, it could affect budget planning and profitability for Indian production houses,"" said Pradeep Dwivedi, chief executive of Eros International Media NSE:EROSMEDIA .""Big-budget films counting on overseas revenue could be restructured or scaled back.""The move will also hurt smaller releases in the United States.""Even a 30% drop in revenue for such mid-scale movies would be a significant dent,"" said Raj Kandukuri, producer of a well-regarded film, ""Pelli Choopulu"", in India's southern language of Telugu. ""There are a sizeable number of students in the United States who watch movies, they will not spend high on ticket prices.""The planned levy might also drive a broader shift to digital platforms.""U.S. distributors might be less inclined to pick up Indian titles due to the increased cost,"" Dwivedi said.""This could result in fewer screens, smaller releases, and a shift toward digital platforms instead of theatrical. The tariff would likely accelerate a move toward direct-to-digital releases on platforms like ErosNow, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.""

Can Netflix Run Continue Despite Tariff Threat?,1746566580000,"The latest tariff news over the weekend had to do with the movie industry. President Trump authorized the Department of Commerce and the USTR to immediately begin the process of instituting 100% tariff on any and all foreign movies coming into the US. While many wondered how exactly that would look given the state of streaming nowadays, it still made a negative impact on Netflix ( NFLX ) Monday morning.The stock gapped down to open the day at $1,114.80, getting as low as $1,107.01. The stock was bid most of the day, closing $10 off its high for the day at $1,134.06. Netflix has been on a tear lately after testing its 200-day, dipping to $821.10 on Monday, April 7th before finding a bid. Earnings helped it along as well.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Netflix’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:354e85034094b:0-can-netflix-run-continue-despite-tariff-threat/
Netflix Stock Has Been a 'Tariff Safe Haven.' That's About to Change. — Barrons.com,1746551340000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix stock has been a solid outperformer this year, but concerns about film tariffs have given investors pause.President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a research note on Tuesday that Netflix ""has been viewed by investors as a 'safe haven' with respect to tariffs.""That safe haven is at risk now following Trump's announcement, and Bazinet wrote the worst case scenario for Netflix would be if the 100% tariff on content produced outside of the U.S. was implemented.""We estimate 50% of content produced by Netflix is created outside the US,"" Bazinet wrote. ""With a 100% tariff, we estimate this could reduce EPS by around $6 per share.""Bazinet, who rates Netflix as Neutral with $1,020 price target, wrote that he believes Netflix will do all it can to mitigate the tariff impacts, which could include shifting production to the U.S., restricting U.S. access to content produced outside the country, and raising prices.There's still a lot of uncertainty around what these tariffs will actually look like.Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok wrote on Tuesday the impact to entertainment companies ""is subject to a vast number of variable terms, including the decision to actually implement the tariff or not, the timing of implementation, and any potential exceptions negotiated by companies or countries.""Netflix declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment Tuesday.Although stocks have taken a hit over tariff worries, Netflix shares have gained 28% this year, compared with the 4.4% decline in the S&P 500.Shares dropped 1.9% on Monday, however, which was the stock's first day closing in the red since April 16.

These 3 Companies Crushed Earnings Season,1748013300000,"The 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly winding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has overall been positive, though commentary surrounding upcoming periods has largely dictated post-earnings moves amid elevated uncertainty stemming from tariff talks.Still, several companies – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – knocked it out of the park, posting robust results that had shareholders pleased. Let’s take a closer look at each release for those interested in near-term momentum.Netflix Shares SurgeConsistently strong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors amid the uncertain environment. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid other trends like the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has been the real highlight from Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.As shown below, Netflix’s sales growth has remained rock-solid, posting double-digit percentage YoY growth in six consecutive periods.Eaton Breaks RecordsEaton’s results were fantastic, with the company posting record Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.72 (up 13% YoY), record Q1 sales of $6.4 billion (up 7% YoY), and record segment margins of 23.9% (80 bp increase YoY). Further, organic sales growth totaled 9%, above the high end of previous guidance. ETN topped off the results by raising its organic revenue growth guidance for its current fiscal year.Backlog growth within its Electrical segment improved 6% year-over-year, whereas its Aerospace backlog also enjoyed a 16% surge from the year-ago period. The company’s top line has shown solid, consistent growth, as shown below.In addition to consistent sales growth, the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, sporting a 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.

Disney Stock Is Struggling. Why Theme-Park Earnings Will Be Key for Any Rebound. — Barrons.com,1746530340000,"By George GloverEarnings from The Walt Disney Co. will give investors a sense of how the entertainment company's most profitable business is holding up, amid worries that President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause U.S. consumer spending to plummet.Disney is set to post its results for the March quarter ahead of the opening bell. It's expected to report an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.09 billion, according to a FactSet poll. A year ago, it reported a profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $21.8 billion.Shares could do with a boost: They have plunged 17% this year, compared with a 3.9% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock is lagging behind rivals Netflix and NBCUniversal parent Comcast, which are up 27% and down 8.2%, respectively, in 2025.Investors see Disney as more exposed to tariffs than its peers. That is because the company made about 60% of its profit over the last fiscal year from its experiences business, which includes theme parks. If the levies drive up inflation, consumers could start spending less on big-ticket items such as vacations, which would weigh on the House of Mouse's top and bottom lines.Analysts are predicting revenue for the experiences segment will have climbed 3.9% from a year ago to $8.7 billion. If that number comes in higher-than-expected, expect Disney shares to rally.Investors will also be hoping for another quarter of growth for Disney's streaming business, which turned its first-ever profit in 2024. They could also zero in on revenue for the company's studios segment, which is reeling from a failed live-action Snow White remake . The film cost nearly $300 million to produce, but flopped amid a backlash about its casting and use of CGI ""dwarfs.""Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

""Both governing bodies have concluded that the offer is inadequate from a financial perspective,"" ProSiebenSat.1 said in a statement, adding that it ""does not reflect the expected future development of the value of the company"".Milan-listed MFE, which holds a 30.14% stake in ProSieben declined to comment.Earlier this month, Czech investment firm PPF, which holds a 15% stake in ProSiben, launched a bid to lift its stake in the German broadcaster up to 29.99%, a move welcomed by ProSiebenSat.MFE made a cash-and-share bid at the minimum level allowed by German takeover rules, offering 4.48 euros in cash and 0.4 MFE A shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share.That is below the current share price of 7.09 euros and PPF's offer of 7 euros per share. Having already crossed a 30% threshold which normally triggers a mandatory 100% takeover offer under German law, MFE will have the option to buy additional shares in the market after the end of its buyout bid.However, a source close to the matter told Reuters last week that it is also weighing whether to raise its bid in response to the counter-proposal by PPF.MFE is looking to build a European ad-funded TV platform to resist competition from the likes of U.S. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and is pushing for an accelerated sale of ProSiebenSat.1's online investments in order to reduce its debt.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RU0ON:0-prosieben-boards-advise-against-takeover-bid-from-berlusconis-mfe/"

Netflix (NFLX) Adds Sesame Street After Trump Cuts PBS Funding,1747844121000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) will begin streaming Sesame Street after Warner Bros Discovery declined to renew its deal and U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order cutting funding to the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio.The agreement gives Netflix global rights to a new season and 90 hours of archived episodes. The show will also remain available on PBS, which will receive new episodes the same day they debut on Netflix. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting confirmed it is terminating a federal program that previously funded children's content like Sesame Street .The platform shift comes as Netflix increases its investment in children's programming, which accounts for about 15% of its total viewership. The company also announced new Peppa Pig episodes and a related mobile game featuring puzzles and coloring.Sesame Street , which first aired in 1969, was created with input from child psychologists and Muppet designer Jim Henson to promote early learning. It has long tackled public policy themes, from childhood obesity to arts education, and has featured public figures like Michelle Obama promoting healthy habits.The deal gives Sesame Street access to Netflix's 300 million global subscribers, expanding its reach beyond U.S. public television at a time of shifting media budgets and policy pressure.- See Netflix insider trades. - Explore Netflix's Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:06aa4f229094b:0-netflix-nflx-adds-sesame-street-after-trump-cuts-pbs-funding/
Disney Earnings: A Closer Look,1746486960000,"Earnings season continues to move rapidly, with this week by far reflecting the busiest yet. So far, the performance has been decent, but recent tariff talks have caused analysts to downwardly revise their earnings expectations for the current (Q2) and coming periods.This week, we’ll hear from entertainment titan Disney DIS. Disney has assets that span movies, television shows, and theme parks.But how does the company shape up heading into its earnings release, particularly on the streaming side? We can use streaming results from Netflix NFLX as a small read-through on the level of demand among consumers. Let’s take a closer look.Netflix ImpressesStrong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has overall been the name of the game for Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.Disney Outlook Remains BearishAnalysts haven’t been bullish for Disney’s quarter to be reported, with the current $1.18 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down roughly 3% since the beginning of February. The value suggests a 3% pullback YoY, whereas sales are expected to grow 5% to $23.1 billion.The company exited its latest period with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscriptions, and more than 120 million Disney+ Core paid subscribers, which reflected an increase of 4.4 million over the prior quarter.So while the company has seen overall subscriber growth, the pace relative to NFLX is much lower, likely a reflection of NFLX’s successful business implementations that got them back on track to subscriber growth.The broader revisions picture for Disney also remains bearish, with the stock sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to negative revisions across the board.Bottom LineWe’ve got a big-time entertainment giant on the reporting docket this week – Disney DIS. A peer concerning streaming, Netflix NFLX, posted notably strong results, reporting great growth overall.Analysts haven’t been bullish regarding Disney’s earnings outlook, with the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate seeing negative revisions since February. Its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating also reflects a broader negative revisions picture overall. Investors should watch for positive earnings estimate revisions post-earnings if commentary supports them, which would reflect a meaningful change in sentiment overall.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6e89f02cf094b:0-disney-earnings-a-closer-look/
Epic Games' Fortnite returns to Apple App Store in US after nearly 5 years,1747781346000,"Epic Games' wildly popular multiplayer shooter game ""Fortnite"" is available again on Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL App Store in the U.S. from Tuesday, capping a ban of nearly five years and marking a major win for the video game company. Epic Games, a U.S.-based studio backed by China's Tencent HKEX:700 , has been locked in a legal battle with Apple since 2020. Epic Games alleged the iPhone maker's practice of charging a commission of up to 30% on in-app payments violated U.S. antitrust rules.Fortnite's return to Apple's iOS systems in the U.S. follows an April 30 ruling by a federal judge saying that Apple violated a U.S. court order that required the company to allow greater competition for app downloads and payment methods in its App Store. The ruling also said that Apple had failed to comply with the judge's prior injunction order and would be referred to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Fortnite's return to its App Store. ""We back fam,"" Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on social media platform X.Launched in 2017, Fortnite became an instant hit, drawing millions of players around the world thanks to its last-player-standing, ""battle royale"" format. At the time of the ban, Epic had 116 million users just on Apple's platform.""For Epic Games this was a hard fought win that carried a very steep price and may be too late to boost its Fortnite game that is now past its prime,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""For Apple this is another crack in the armor that the services business relies on — the funneling of payments through Apple in order to charge developers for every transaction.""Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, said this opened the door for subscription apps like Spotify NYSE:SPOT and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX to claw back margin and for independent studios to monetize without having to pay Apple an extra commission, potentially reshaping iOS economics over the next 12-18 months. Apple and Alphabet's Google NASDAQ:GOOG had banned Fortnite from their stores in 2020 over a tussle about in-app payment guidelines. The game had already returned to Google's Android devices worldwide and iPhones in the EU last year.The game title was also available on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union, Fortnite said on X on Tuesday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RS1LP:0-epic-games-fortnite-returns-to-apple-app-store-in-us-after-nearly-5-years/"
Movie-Tariff Plan Rattles Media Stocks. The Fine Print Will Be Critical. — Barrons.com,1746480480000,"By Elsa Ohlen and Angela PalumboShares of U.S. media companies fell as President Donald Trump took aim at the movie industry, saying he will impose a 100% import tax on films produced abroad.""I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday night. He referred to efforts by other countries to create incentives for domestic production as a national security threat.""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,"" a White House spokesperson said.Netflix fell 1.9%, Warner Bros slid 2%, while Paramount was down 1.6%. Cinemark shares dropped 1.7%. Walt Disney slipped 0.4% and Comcast was flat.The S&P 500 was down 0.6%.None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment.Trump's announcement comes after China said in April that it was cutting imports of American films following U.S. tariff decisions. A tariff on films also would mark a shift in the Trump administration's trade policy. Until now, the White House has focused on taxing physical goods, not services.Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan said the tariff announcement ""injects further noise into sentiment for essentially every entertainment stock.""While tariffs risk denting the profitability of movie makers because a decent chunk of Hollywood's output is shot overseas to take advantage of tax benefits and other incentives, the extent of the damage would depend on the fine print. It wasn't clear whether movies and TV shows shot overseas but finished in the U.S., or content made abroad but available to U.S. audiences, would be subject to the tariff.Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a research note on Monday that it was also unclear if these tariffs would be strictly designed for movies set for theatrical releases, or will also affect streamed-only films. That would be a crucial distinction for a company like Netflix, which releases its originals on its streaming platform.""We think the large studios and distributors including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount, Comcast/NBC Universal, Lionsgate, and Sony, and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" she wrote.For now, analysts are sticking with their stock recommendations and share-price targets, though Reese noted that the news could weigh on movie companies in the near term. She reiterated a Neutral rating on Cinemark with a price target of $32, citing uncertainty around tariffs.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

2 Reasons Netflix’s 40% Rally Is Far From Over,1747765860000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Shares of  Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on an absolute tear in recent weeks.They’re now  up more than 40% since the first week of April, breaking through previous records and entering the rarefied four-figure price range . While that kind of move tends to raise concerns about overheating, especially with the RSI now at 68 , there are still two major reasons to believe the rally could continue into the summer, and why any pullback should be viewed as a buying opportunity.1. Fundamentals Are Red HotNetflix’s latest earnings release firmly put its growth story in the spotlight. The company reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that came in well ahead of expectations, with the latter up 12.5% year-over-year . But what stood out most were the operating metrics. Operating income climbed 27% , while operating margin reached 32% , up from 28% a year earlier . Management also guided to even stronger profitability , forecasting a 33% margin for Q2 and reaffirming their full-year target of 29% .The top-line outlook was also upgraded. Netflix now expects full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion , up from previous guidance and above consensus estimates .This reflects not only price increases and membership growth but also a sharp uptick in ad revenue , which the company says will roughly double in 2025.Subscriber growth was another standout.Netflix added 18.91 million net new subscribers in the quarter, blowing away expectations of 9.18 million . It was the highest quarterly net addition in company history, showing the platform is still gaining traction despite rising competition and market maturity.2. Wall Street Is Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Following that blowout report, analysts have begun to revise their targets higher. Last week, Wolfe Research reiterated its bullish stance and issued a new price target of $1,340. This echoed the call from Robert Baird who lifted its target to $1,300 , while Canaccord Genuity Group went even further, calling for $1,380 .Those targets imply more than 15% upside from where the stock closed on Monday. That’s a significant projection for a company of Netflix’s size, especially after such a strong run. It also shows that many believe this is not the top but rather a new baseline from which the next leg higher can form.These bullish forecasts are backed by Netflix’s ability to monetize its subscriber base through pricing, premium content, and a fast-growing ad business. With record subscriber growth and rising profitability, the company is executing at a level few of the tech giants can match.Why One Major Firm Just Turned CautiousEven with Netflix firing on all cylinders, some analysts are beginning to voice caution, not about the business, but the stock’s near-term setup. On Monday, J.P. Morgan  downgraded Netflix to Neutral from Overweight , citing a more balanced risk/reward profile following the stock’s significant rally.With shares hitting all-time highs and trading at roughly 39x 2026 earnings and 44x free cash flow , the valuation has started to limit the upside in the short term.The firm still sees Netflix as a long-term leader in global streaming, driven by top-tier content, accelerating profitability, and a dominant position in the shift away from linear TV. But with macro conditions improving and market risk appetite broadening, the team there expects some capital rotation away from defensive names like Netflix toward more beaten-down sectors.What to Watch in the Weeks AheadThey also noted that following recent events like the company’s  Upfront presentation , Netflix may face a quieter period on the catalyst front as it heads into summer, even with strong Q3 content on deck .Still, the structural bull case remains intact . Netflix’s ability to scale globally, grow advertising revenue, and retain its content advantage means pullbacks should be seen in context: as a natural pause in a longer-term uptrend , not a reversal.

'Sesame Street' Finds a New Home on Netflix — WSJ,1747679640000,"By Joseph De AvilaElmo and Cookie Monster are heading to Netflix.The streaming giant has reached an agreement to broadcast new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" giving the beloved children's show a home after Warner Bros. Discovery said it was stepping away from the program.The agreement, which begins with the upcoming 56th season, includes 90 hours of previous episodes. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization that produces ""Sesame Street, "" said new episodes will also air on PBS stations and PBS Kids the same day they debut on Netflix. PBS has broadcast ""Sesame Street"" for over 50 years. Under its previous deal with Warner Bros.

Netflix Could Get a Boost From Live Events. J.P. Morgan Downgraded It Anyway. — Barrons.com,1747674660000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix shares could continue to shine if the streaming company keeps hosting sporting events, but that didn't stop one J.P. Morgan analyst from downgrading the stock on Monday.Doug Anmuth downgraded the shares to Neutral from Overweight while also raising his price target to $1,220 from $1,150.""To be clear, there's no change to our long-term bullish view on NFLX's streaming leadership position & the company's potential to effectively become global TV over time,"" Anmuth wrote in a research note on Monday. ""However, more near-term, following significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, we believe the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced.""Shares of Netflix were down 0.6% on Monday to $1,184.75. The stock has surged 33% this year, far outperforming the 1% increase of the S&P 500 in 2025.Wall Street hasn't only been pleased with Netflix's performance over the last few quarters, but is also confident it can withstand economic turmoil.Netflix has been performing well because of the company's decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-price ad tier. The changes led to more people opening their own accounts and provided users with a cheaper option, which could prevent subscription cancellations if times get tough. Netflix has also introduced live events to its streaming platform, including comedy roasts and NFL games.""Live events/sports content could also drive strong engagement, ad dollars, & subscriber growth,"" Anmuth wrote.Netflix is hosting two NFL games on Christmas again this year. The 2024 Christmas games were the two most streamed NFL games in U.S. history, according to Netflix.A CNBC reporter also said on The Town podcast May 16 that he spoke to one of the co-CEOs of Netflix who ""admitted to me, like, 'Yeah, I talked to [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell on the side about adding even more games beyond our two Christmas games.'""Barron's has reached out to Netflix and the NFL for comment.But while Netflix investors may be excited about the idea of the company hosting more live events down the line, there are still risks to the stock.President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""There aren't many details, but increased costs could hurt margins and potentially push Netflix to raise prices. Netflix is also at risk of people trading down to lower-priced subscription offerings or canceling if tariffs take a bite out of their budgets. Data from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment fell to its second-lowest reading on record in May.Investors will have to decide whether to follow Anmuth's advice and wait on the sidelines, or bet on a streaming service that continues to outperform.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent. Higher yields tend to compress valuations for growth stocks, which rely on future earnings.Read more: Adani, Tata, Vedanta make a power play for coal-fired projects after five-year lullThe downbeat session came just after markets closed out a stellar week.

The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone.

"For Netflix, the Mere Threat of Tariffs is Bad Enough — Heard on the Street — WSJ",1746474240000,"By Dan GallagherWall Street sees President Trump's ""Hollywood Tariffs"" as unlikely. But Netflix wasn't even priced for the possibility.The streaming giant's share price was down a little over 1% by Monday afternoon. That's an improvement over the stock's 4% drop around the day's opening bell, which followed Trump announcing a plan for 100% tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands."" The announcement hit movie stocks across the board.Trump's announcement-made over his Truth Social network-was scant on details. But some analysts so far are skeptical. ""We think the Trump administration will face tremendous pushback,"" wrote Michael Pachter of Wedbush in a note to clients. Doug Creutz of TD Cowen described the tariffs as ""politically charged, logistically challenging, and ultimately unlikely to advance meaningfully"" in his own report.But unlike traditional media stocks that have mostly been in a slump this year, Netflix shares have been flying high. The stock was mostly unscathed by Trump's initial tariff announcements in early April, due to the belief that subscription-based streaming services like Netflix and Spotify would be largely immune to the effects of such measures. Netflix shares also got an additional boost from a strong first-quarter report on April 17.All told, Netflix was up 30% for the year by the end of last week, compared to a 4% drop for the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Group. That run had put Netflix shares to a multiple of about 42 times projected earnings-40% higher than what the stock was fetching a year ago and nearly triple Disney's multiple.In a report Monday, Jason Bazinet of Citigroup estimated a ""worst-case"" of about $3 billion a year in additional costs to Netflix from the tariffs Trump outlined, but added that the company ""has a range of options at its disposal to limit the impact."" Still, he noted that the idea of Netflix as a ""safe haven"" from tariffs is now under threat. Even safe havens have their price.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

"JPMorgan cuts Netflix rating, citing balanced risk-reward post-rally; stock falls",1747653114000,"Shares of Netflix fell over 2.3% in premarket trading Monday after JPMorgan downgraded the streaming giant to “neutral” from “overweight”, even as it raised its price target on the stock to $1,220 from $1,150. The new target implies a modest 2.38% upside from the company’s last close at $1,191.53. The company has also removed Netflix from the US Equity Analyst Focus List, it said.The downgrade comes despite JPMorgan reiterating its belief in Netflix’s long-term leadership in the global streaming industry and its potential to effectively become the world’s dominant TV platform. Few near-term catalysts; easing trade fears could shift focus: JPMorganNetflix shares have surged more than 34% so far in 2025, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Movies & Entertainment index, which has risen 20.87%. The stock also recently crossed the $500 billion market capitalization mark for the first time, underscoring investor confidence in the company’s business model and growth potential.However, the brokerage said the stock’s significant rally over recent months has made the risk/reward outlook more evenly balanced in the near term.Analysts said the sharp gains likely reflect much of the upside embedded in the company’s 2025 earnings guidance. As a result, they see limited near-term catalysts to drive the stock substantially higher.It also said that while the company’s shares have held up well, if concerns about tariffs and the broader economy continue to ease, investors may shift their focus to other internet stocks and market sectors that have been more vulnerable & pressured.A safe haven in a volatile marketNetflix’s recent stock gains have been attributed to its perceived immunity from tariff threats and economic uncertainty. The company imports entertainment, not physical goods, insulating it from the cost pressures that have hit other firms amid escalating trade tensions. Even when former President Donald Trump floated a 100% import duty on foreign films, Netflix stock fell just 2% as investors bet the company could adjust by shifting production to the US or raising subscription prices.Moreover, Netflix has historically performed well during periods of economic stress. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it posted double-digit gains as homebound users streamed popular titles.That history has made it a preferred choice among investors seeking stability.According to data compiled by LSEG, the average rating of 51 analysts on Netflix is a “buy”, with a median PT of $1,150.Valuation concerns begin to surfaceAt around 43 times forward earnings, Netflix’s valuation has become a topic of concern. It trades at a premium compared to the S&P 500’s multiple of 21 and even the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants, which average 27.However, the company has historically commanded a higher premium. Its average P/E ratio over the past five years stands at 52.Ben James, a strategist at Baillie Gifford’s US growth fund, told Barron’s that the stock’s transformation from a speculative content spender to a profitable business has justified its valuation. The firm, which owns roughly 4 million Netflix shares valued at $4.5 billion, remains optimistic that operating margins could nearly double from the current 27% to as high as 50% by 2030.“It’s invested so much in its own content that it’s built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,” James said. “When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it’s over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.”Looking ahead to 2030Executives are reportedly targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of the decade, according to The Wall Street Journal . While the company has surpassed the critical $500 billion mark, the it will need to sustain rapid earnings growth and margin expansion to hit that milestone. While short-term valuations may limit further gains, many investors remain focused on the long-term narrative that Netflix will continue to shape the future of global entertainment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:eeb6d554c094b:0-jpmorgan-cuts-netflix-rating-citing-balanced-risk-reward-post-rally-stock-falls/

"Media, Streaming Stocks Fall as Trump Proposes 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Made Movies",1746464371000,"Shares of major media, streaming and television companies were down Monday after US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff rate on foreign-produced films, with Wedbush Securities saying that Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD and Paramount Global NASDAQ:PARA are among the companies that face a ""significant amount"" of risk. In a social media post Sunday, Trump said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative to immediately start the process of imposing 100% duties on ""any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands."" Other nations are offering ""all sorts of incentives"" to pull American filmmakers and studios away from the US, thus impacting Hollywood, he said.

Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , which owns the Amazon Prime streaming service, was down 1.6%. ""We think the large studios and distributors including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount, Comcast/NBC Universal, Lionsgate, and Sony TSE:6758 , and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" Wedbush analysts, including Alicia Reese, said in a Monday note to clients. As long as there's some production in the US, a tariff could likely be avoided or minimized, the analysts said. The Motion Picture Association of America didn't immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment. Trump's move is likely to draw a ""tremendous pushback,"" initially from other countries that may impose tariffs or announce an outright ban on US-produced content, and eventually from Congress, according to Wedbush. The brokerage said it's currently not clear if Trump's proposed tariffs will apply to ticket sales or the entire value chain, including streaming. In the near term, studios can shift some portion of their production to the US with logistical adjustments and higher tax rates, unless cities offer ""similar"" tax relief as the foreign territories provided, Wedbush said. The brokerage assumed that 75% of Netflix's overall content is produced overseas, with foreign language content all international and a ""large percentage"" of domestic production moved to the UK and Canada for cost savings. The streaming giant has ""little control"" over where the vast majority of its content is produced, according to the note. Wedbush said it's is unsure if the tariffs will apply to Netflix's already-produced content or newly produced projects.

Netflix Stock Is Still A Buy Despite Its Lofty Valuation — Barron's,1747445400000,"The shares were a tariff winner, and that won't change even with the China trade deal. By George GloverIn a market that has felt like a horror show for much of 2025, Netflix has been one of the few feel-good stories in town.The video streamer looks like the rare sort of stock that can outperform no matter what happens on the trade front. Its shares, at a recent $1,173.25, have jumped 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a brutal and broad selloff, while the S&P 500 index is up 4.1% over the same period. On Thursday, Netflix was less than $1 billion away from closing with a market value of $500 billion for the first time.It isn't hard to see why Netflix has become one of the market's go-to safe havens. It imports content, not goods, so there's little risk of the White House's reciprocal levies driving up its costs. Shares dipped just 2% the day Trump threatened to impose 100% import duties on foreign movies, as investors realized that the company could mitigate much of the earnings impact by either shifting production to the U.S. or raising its prices.The stock also has a pedigree as a name that can outperform in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, racking up double-digit gains during the Covid-19 pandemic as widespread lockdowns led to users plowing through smash-hit series like Tiger King and The Last Dance.But while other perceived havens like gold could struggle now that the Trump administration has brokered a deal with China to cut most tariffs for 90 days, Netflix ought to be able to build on its strong run this year.The only real mark against the stock right now is valuation. Due to the recent rally, shares aren't cheap — they currently fetch about 43 times future earnings, meaning they're trading at a significant premium to both the benchmark S&P 500, at 21 times, and the Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech names it's often compared with, at 27 times.Still, Netflix has averaged a price/earnings ratio of 52 over the past five years, so judging by recent history it isn't expensive. Over that time the stock has gone from ""a loss-making challenger where everyone was skeptical about how much it's spending on content to a reliable, profitable compounder,"" Ben James, a strategist at the Edinburgh-based investment management firm Baillie Gifford's U.S. growth fund, tells Barron's. The firm holds a little more than 4 million shares, a position that's valued at about $4.5 billion.The bull case hinges on the idea that the streamer will be able to grow earnings at a fast enough rate to maintain the stock's recent momentum. James argues that operating margins, currently at 27%, could nearly double by the end of 2030.He says that over the past decade, Netflix has managed to engineer a self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users. The streamer has already done the hard work, pouring money into creating a vast library of films and movies.""It's invested so much in its own content that it's built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,"" James says. ""When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it's over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.""Executives are targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, up from $484 billion right now. Even at Netflix's current lofty valuation, it would be all set to hit the 13-figure threshold if it could manage the necessary margin growth.The rollout of cheaper subscription plans could also help supercharge profit. Netflix unlocked a fresh revenue stream when it introduced ad-supported tiers in November 2022. Ads accounted for just 4% of revenue in 2024, but the company projects ad revenue to double this year, and its advertising president, Amy Reinhard, said Wednesday that the ad-supported tiers had added 24 million users over the past six months. James thinks the streamer will soon be able to leverage artificial intelligence to target users and make the tiers more profitable.Live sports programming could also help the streamer reach untapped markets. It might seem like every household has a Netflix account, but there's still plenty of room for the streamer to grow. For the fourth quarter of 2024, it reported 301.6 million subscribers globally. Three years ago, Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann estimated a total addressable market of between 700 million and 1 billion homes.Netflix might not even be a pure-play streamer for much longer. In February the company opened its first restaurant, Netflix Bites in Las Vegas, where fans can tuck into dishes inspired by well-known films and TV shows. It's also set to launch two experiential venues it's dubbed Netflix Houses sometime later this year.All that makes for a tempting growth story. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to rise 26% this year, another 20% in 2026, and then another 18% in 2027.Despite Netflix's stellar gains this year, investors shouldn't feel like they've missed the boat. Surging profit could quickly make the streamer look cheap again. Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for that.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515000044:0/
"Impact of Trump's Planned Tariffs on Foreign Films Still Unclear for Netflix, Wedbush Says",1746458519000,"It's unclear to what extent the Trump administration's planned tariffs on foreign films will apply to Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , Wedbush said in a research note Monday. President Donald Trump said Sunday in a social media post he plans to impose a 100% tariff on movies shot outside the US, according to media reports. ""We do not know the extent to which this will apply to Netflix,"" Wedbush said. ""We do not know if this will apply to already-produced or only apply to newly produced content.""Wedbush said that ""75% of Netflix's overall content is produced internationally, with foreign language content all international and a large percentage of domestic production moved to Canada and the UK for cost savings.""The ""portion of Netflix's $18 billion in content spending that is newly produced is likely only around $3 billion-$5 billion, and of that, only $2 billion-$3 billion is foreign produced,"" the investment firm said. ""The balance of its spending is for content that was produced prior to the materialization of Trump's whim and caprice, and an interpretation of his 'idea' will determine whether the impact will be felt in 2025 or in 2026 and beyond,"" the note said. Also, Trump's planned tariffs on films made outside the US will likely ""face tremendous pushback, initially from foreign countries imposing tariffs (or an outright ban) on US-produced content, and eventually from Congress,"" the note said.

3 Reasons Why Earnings Season Rocks ,1747418400000,"Imagine that, once every few months, you must release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.Sounds intimidating, right?That’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.The period is undoubtedly hectic for market participants, with companies finally revealing what’s transpired behind closed doors.And on top of being hectic, it’s impossible to understate the importance of the period. For those wondering why it’s so critical, let’s look at a few reasons that help explain its significance.1. Critical Business UpdatesEarnings reports provide market participants with a plethora of information, including revenues, expenses, and profits, just to provide a few simple examples.Take, for example, Palantir PLTR, which recently upped its current year revenue growth guidance, causing shares to soar post-earnings. PLTR has communicated that it’s been enjoying healthy demand thanks to the AI frenzy, reflected by the guidance upgrade.Analysts accordingly adjusted their current year sales expectations following the guidance upgrade, with the company now forecasted to see 35% YoY revenue growth.2. Share Price ImpactA company’s quarterly earnings report commonly impacts its stock price, a theme that market participants have undoubtedly noticed. Typically, we’ll see bullish share movement post-earnings from companies that surprise positively or raise their guidance, reflecting healthy underlying business.Netflix NFLX saw its shares soar following its latest quarterly print, with the company crushing on subscriber metrics while also posting 25% EPS growth on the back of 12% higher sales. As shown below, shares have soared following back-to-back releases.It’s worth noting that implementing a stop-loss at a comfortable threshold will help limit spooky post-earnings price swings, preserving precious capital.3. Highlights Current TrendsEarnings season can also provide a big-picture view of overall trends within the economy or industries. For a simple example, if many retail companies fall short of expectations, it could be a sign of a slowing consumer or economy, which has knock-on effects across the market.Conversely, if many retail companies report stronger-than-expected earnings, it may signal that the economy is moving along just fine, underpinned by a healthy consumer.It also allows investors to position themselves appropriately. For example, Newmont NEM, one of the world's largest producers of gold, has benefited significantly from the rise in gold, which was reflected in its latest quarterly print.The average gold price per oz reached $2,643 throughout Newmont’s latest period, melting higher from the $2,004 mark in the same period last year. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion throughout the period was the company’s highest read ever.Analysts have raised their EPS expectations across the board amid the favorable operating environment, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares overall reflect a great way to obtain exposure to the recent run in gold.Bottom LineWhile earnings season is undeniably hectic for everyone involved, that’s just the nature of the period.It’s important for investors to understand why it matters for many reasons, including providing investors with an updated financial standing, the volatile post-earnings share swings, and the overall picture it provides on market and broader trends.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7d5ebe7a7094b:0-3-reasons-why-earnings-season-rocks/
"Tariff News: A Trade Deal May Come This Week, Report Says — Barrons.com",1746450780000,"By Brian SwintPresident Donald Trump is hoping to pin down at least one trade deal with a country trying to lower tariffs against it before the end of the week, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified senior administration official.That would be a milestone as the deadline for higher tariffs to take effect in July approaches. Trump is looking for agreements from trading partners to buy more U.S. goods and reduce non-tariff barriers. The president has also said that the current 145% levy on Chinese imports will eventually come down.At the same time, administration officials are feeling more confident about the economic outlook, the report said. That follows a strong nonfarm payrolls report from April on Friday. Congress is this week turning its attention to a tax and spending bill that could bolster growth.Nevertheless, Trump said a downturn was still possible in a television interview on Sunday. ""Anything can happen,"" he told NBC's Meet the Press when asked if the country would fall into recession.Here's the latest on tariffs.Foxconn Sales JumpHon Hai Precision Industry Co, the company also known as Foxconn that assembles iPhones for Apple, said sales jumped 26% in April as clients rushed to make orders before tariffs come into effect. Revenue in the first four months of the year was the best on record.Apple, which is Foxconn's biggest customer, said last week that it expects tariffs to add $900 million to costs in the June quarter. It is planning on moving production of iPhones for sale in the U.S. to India and Vietnam, rather than China.Foxconn also boasts Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Sony as clients.Movies TargetedTrump said in a Truth Social post that he is putting a 100% tariff on movies produced in other countries.

Trump tariff order on movies leaves film industry flummoxed,1746449860000,"The entertainment industry reacted with alarm and bafflement on Monday after President Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., but issued few details on just how such a levy would work.Veteran studio executives who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity said the announcement on Sunday left unanswered the timing of the proposed levy and how it would be enforced for an industry whose biggest-budget films are often produced across several continents. Trump's pronouncement followed his meeting at Mar-a-Lago with his Hollywood ambassador, actor Jon Voight, special advisor Steven Paul and media executive Scott Karol. The group mulled a range of ideas to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives, tax code changes and imposing tariffs ""in certain limited circumstances,"" the group said in a statement. Slapping levies on an industry like film would mark a major extension of tariffs as a policy tool into services, for which the U.S. runs a sizable trade surplus. And like the auto , pharmaceutical and chip industries before it, Trump's declaration threatens to put another business in a tariff-induced state of limbo. The industry has been pressing for tax incentives to boost output in Los Angeles, the movie industry's glitzy historic hub of cinema, as studios have shifted production to locations such as the UK, Canada and Australia to take advantage of generous tax credits and lower labor costs. A survey among studio executives over their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 by ProdPro showed the top five choices were all elsewhere. The White House's trade policy is aimed at boosting U.S. industrial activity, but the series of levies and rollbacks has sapped consumer and business confidence.Tariffs on movies might prove particularly hard to implement.One studio executive compared movie production to auto manufacturing, with various pieces - filming, visual effects and other elements - completed around the world, then assembled, through post-production, in the U.S. Some executives wondered whether the levy would apply only to the work done elsewhere, or attach to projects jointly financed by foreign investors. Producer Todd Garner said proposed tariffs could have the unintended consequence of stymieing creativity. He cited director Steven Spielberg's acclaimed World War II epic on the invasion of Normandy, France, ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""How would you make 'Saving Private Ryan' in the U.S.? In Shreveport?"" Garner said from Australia, where he is filming the action-drama 'Runner.' ""Or a globe-trotting 'Mission: Impossible?'"" On Monday, Trump told reporters he would meet with industry officials first to make sure they liked the idea. The White House said it had not made any final decisions, but noted that Hollywood film production had sharply declined from the previous year.The primary union representing actors issued a supportive statement on Monday. SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the union supports efforts to increase domestic movie, television and streaming production and adding jobs for American workers. ""We look forward to learning more about the specifics of the plan announced by the president and to advancing a dialogue to achieve our common goals,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union representing more than 170,000 technicians and craftspeople, called for a balanced federal response that includes tax incentives to help bring jobs back. Any trade policy ""must do no harm to our Canadian members — nor the industry overall,"" said International Alliance President Matthew D. Loeb. IMPLEMENTATION CONFUSIONShares of media companies slipped on Monday. Streaming pioneer Netflix, NASDAQ:NFLX which relies on global operations to produce content for international audiences, posted a 2% decline in its stock. Disney NYSE:DIS and Universal-owner Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA edged lower. Stocks of theater operators such as Cinemark NYSE:CNK and IMAX NYSE:IMAX were down 1.6% and 2%, respectively.IMAX declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment.Entertainment attorney Stephen Weizenecker said producers, financiers and film offices were trying to figure out how tariffs would be implemented, but said it could lead to a notable shift in production back to the United States. ""If you get any sort of significant tariff, 10% or 20%, it takes away whatever production incentive there was for filming outside the United States,"" said Weizenecker, who advises producers and financiers on production incentives. However, traditional enforcement tools, like customs inspections at ports of entry, will not work for movies that are licensed, streamed or distributed on global platforms using a borderless cloud infrastructure, wrote TD Cowen media analyst Doug Creutz. The ""risks to putting digital goods and services on the table in trade negotiations/wars are overwhelmingly tilted against the U.S.,"" he noted. Hollywood brings in most of its box office revenue from overseas. In 2024, about 70% of the roughly $30 billion in global ticket sales came from outside the United States and Canada, said Daniel Loria, senior vice president at The Boxoffice Company.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RD0ND:0-trump-tariff-order-on-movies-leaves-film-industry-flummoxed/"

S&P 500 Achieves a Milestone After Two Decades - 5 Top Picks,1746447840000,"The S&P 500 Index has been able to recoup all losses suffered due to the Trump administration’s tariff-led market mayhem at a lightning speed. On May 2, the broad-market index recorded a nine-day winning streak, for the first time since November 2004. With this, Wall Street’s most observed stock index recovered all losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced the imposition of reciprocal tariffs. The index is currently around 7% away from its all-time high recorded in February. During the tariff-led April turmoil, at one point, the S&P 500 was down nearly 20% from its all-time high and was on the verge of entering the bear market zone. In addition, the index also posted two consecutive weeks of a winning run.At this stage, we recommend investing in five S&P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided more than 20% returns year to date. These are: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Newmont Corp. NEM, CenterPoint Energy Inc. CNP and Exelon Corp. EXC. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings growth potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Netflix Inc.Netflix handsomely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for bottom line while the top line was mostly in line with the consensus mark in first-quarter 2025. Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels. NFLX reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.The primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Netflix’s policies of offering an ad-supported lower-priced tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer a high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 27.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. Philip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris has benefited from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio. PM has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, PM aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.Philip Morris is set for another year of robust growth in 2025, driven by increasing demand across all product categories. PM anticipates positive volume growth for the fifth consecutive year, with an expected increase of 2%. Smoke-free products remain a key growth driver, projected to expand by 12-14%, reinforcing PM’s strategic shift toward reduced-risk alternatives.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 13.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last 30 days. Newmont Corp.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. NEM is likely to gain from several projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest also created an industry-leading portfolio and provided opportunities for significant synergies. NEM also remains focused on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders.Newmont has received full funds approval for its Ahafo North project and the project has reached the execution stage. Commercial production for the project is expected to commence in second-half 2025. NEM remains committed to Ghana, investing $950 million to $1,050 million in development capital for Ahafo North. Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.1% and 16.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 23.4% over the last 30 days. CenterPoint Energy Inc.CenterPoint Energy is likely to benefit from increasing electricity demand, backed by rapid electrification of transportation amid rising investments in renewable energy. CNP aims to invest substantially in upgrading its infrastructure. Successful returns from these investments should boost CNP’s long-term growth. CNP boasts a solid solvency position.With the rapid electrification of the transportation sector, backed by growing clean energy adoption among industries across the board, the utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased manifold in recent times. To tap the growth benefits of the EV market, CenterPoint Energy has been investing significantly in building a smarter, cleaner and more resilient ecosystem to meet the needs of EV drivers and fleet operators. To this end, CNP has been actively promoting off-road electrification, including electric forklifts and carts.CenterPoint Energy has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.4% and 8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Exelon Corp.Exelon’s investment will strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure and help in providing reliable services to customers. EXC’s initiatives in grid modernization will improve the resilience of its operations, and revenue decoupling will mitigate the impact of load fluctuation. A stable cash flow allows EXC to pay out regular dividends. The development of data centers will increase demand. Exelon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 6.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 30 days.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5102ac122094b:0-s-p-500-achieves-a-milestone-after-two-decades-5-top-picks/
Netflix vs. Paramount Global: Which Streaming Provider is a Better Buy?,1747401840000,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of entertainment streaming, Netflix NFLX and Paramount Global PARA represent two distinct approaches to capturing audience attention and market share. Netflix, the pioneer that transformed how we consume content, has evolved into a global powerhouse with more than 300 million paid households. Paramount Global, born from the merger of ViacomCBS, combines traditional media assets with streaming ambitions through Paramount+.Both companies are navigating similar challenges: intensifying competition, evolving consumer preferences, and the need to balance content investments with profitability. As streaming becomes the dominant form of entertainment consumption, investors are increasingly scrutinizing which media companies can deliver sustainable growth and returns in this new paradigm.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for NFLX StockNetflix has demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation in the first quarter of 2025, posting impressive results that highlight its dominant position in the streaming wars. Revenues grew 13% year over year to $10.5 billion, while operating income surged 27% to $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects Netflix's successful execution of its strategic priorities, which include improving content offerings and growing its advertising business.The company's content strategy continues to deliver results, with breakthrough originals like Adolescence , which became the third most popular English-language series ever with 124 million views. Netflix's international expansion is equally impressive, with significant investments in local content production across 50 countries. This global approach has paid dividends, as evidenced by the company's U.K. success, where it has captured 9% of TV viewing time, trailing only BBC and ITV.Netflix's upcoming content pipeline further strengthens its investment case. The second quarter features high-profile films like Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Straw with Taraji P. Henson and Havoc featuring Tom Hardy. The highly anticipated final season of Squid Game , Netflix's most popular series ever, debuts on Jun. 27, 2025, accompanied by updates to the related games experience, showcasing Netflix's cross-platform content monetization strategy.Netflix's financial discipline stands out as a particular strength. The company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow for the first quarter, demonstrating its ability to convert growth into tangible returns for shareholders. Management has also set ambitious but achievable targets, including doubling revenues by 2030 and achieving $9 billion in annual advertising revenues by the same year. The company's advertising business represents a significant growth opportunity, with the successful launch of Netflix's Ad Suite in the United States on April 1 and international expansion planned for this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025, creating a new revenue stream that complements its successful subscription model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.47 billion, indicating 14.01% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.33 per share, indicating 27.74% growth year over year. Netflix, Inc. Price and ConsensusNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for PARA StockParamount Global has been struggling to transform itself amid significant challenges. While the company posted revenues of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, this represented a 6% decline year over year, even when excluding the impact of the prior year's Super Bowl broadcast. The company's TV Media segment, which still accounts for the largest portion of revenues, saw a concerning 13% decrease.Despite reaching 79 million Paramount+ subscribers, the Direct-to-Consumer segment continues to operate at a loss of $109 million. Although this represents an improvement of $177 million year over year, it pales in comparison to Netflix's profitability and scale. Additionally, Paramount+ faces subscriber growth challenges, with management warning about expected subscriber declines in the second quarter due to content seasonality and the termination of an international hard bundle partnership.Paramount Global's content strategy appears unfocused compared with Netflix, spreading investments across traditional broadcast, cable networks, film, and streaming. While the company celebrates shows like Landman and 1923 , it lacks the consistent hit ratio of Netflix. The company also faces monetization challenges with Pluto TV, its free ad-supported service, where increased supply in digital video has pressured advertising revenues.The uncertain Skydance merger further complicates Paramount Global's investment case. Though management confirmed the transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2025, this pending deal creates uncertainty about future strategic direction. Questions also remain about the treatment of voting shareholders in the transaction, as highlighted by recent legal challenges from GAMCO Investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PARA’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.32 per share, indicating a 14.29% decrease year over year. The consensus estimate for 2025 revenues is pinned at $28.43 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 2.67%.Paramount Global Price and ConsensusParamount Global price-consensus-chart | Paramount Global QuoteStock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonNetflix currently trades at a premium valuation compared to Paramount Global, but the disparity appears justified given the companies' divergent financial trajectories. Netflix's price-to-earnings ratio of 43.21x reflects investors' confidence in its sustainable growth model, robust free cash flow generation, and clear path to increased profitability. In contrast, PARA's lower valuation multiple of 7.48x signals market skepticism about its ability to successfully navigate the transition to streaming.NFLX vs. PARA: P/E F12M RatioStock performance tells a similar story. Netflix shares have shown strong momentum, trading near all-time highs and significantly outperforming both the broader market and the entertainment sector. Paramount Global shares, meanwhile, have underperformed, weighed down by concerns about linear TV decline, streaming profitability challenges and transaction uncertainty.Shares of NFLX have surged 32.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming PARA and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.NFLX Outperforms PARA, Sector YTDNetflix's solid balance sheet, with $7.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, provides flexibility for content investments and shareholder returns. Paramount Global, despite generating $123 million in free cash flow in the first quarter, faces greater financial constraints and uncertainty about future capital allocation priorities.ConclusionNetflix emerges as the superior investment choice in the streaming wars based on its robust financial performance, strategic clarity, and execution capabilities. While Paramount struggles with declining legacy businesses and unprofitable streaming operations, Netflix continues to innovate and expand its dominance globally. NFLX's superior content strategy, successful advertising initiatives, and impressive cash flow generation create a compelling investment case. Investors should consider buying Netflix for its long-term growth prospects and potential for increased shareholder returns, while approaching Paramount Global with caution given its structural challenges and uncertain future. In the battle for streaming supremacy, Netflix has established itself as the safer and more promising investment bet. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas PARA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:14747e805094b:0-netflix-vs-paramount-global-which-streaming-provider-is-a-better-buy/
US media stocks fall as Trump threatens 100% tariff on foreign-made films,1746444974000,"American media stocks tumbled on Monday after President Donald Trump unveiled a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., a move that could sharply raise costs for Hollywood studios and rattle the global entertainment industry.Trump's announcement was short on details. It did not say whether the levies will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.Streaming pioneer Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX could particularly be at risk, analysts said, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares fell 4.9% in premarket action, leading a slide in media stocks.Despite Los Angeles' longstanding reputation as the hub of cinema, studios have over the years shifted production overseas to locations such as the UK due to attractive tax breaks and lower costs. None of the 10 best picture contenders for this year's Oscars were filmed in the Californian city.A forced move back to the U.S. would likely drive up production budgets for an industry that now relies on a global supply chain — with shoots in Europe, post-production hubs in Canada and visual effects teams spread across Southeast Asia.Walt Disney Co NYSE:DIS , Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD and Universal-owner Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA were down between 0.8% and 2.7%.""The problem is that pretty much all the studios are moving tons of production overseas to reduce production costs and leverage foreign credits,"" said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett. ""Raising the cost to produce movies could lead studios to make less content. There's also a risk of retaliatory tariffs against American content overseas."" American movies generated $22.6 billion in exports and a trade surplus of $15.3 billion in 2023, according to the American Motion Picture And Television Industry.A survey conducted by ProdPro among studio executives regarding their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 showed that the top five choices were all outside the U.S.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RD0FS:0-us-media-stocks-fall-as-trump-threatens-100-tariff-on-foreign-made-films/"

"Netflix, Other Movie Stocks Fall After Trump Threatens Tariffs on Foreign-Made Films — WSJ",1746443580000,"By Caitlin McCabeShares of U.S. studios and entertainment companies dropped in premarket trading Monday, after President Trump called for a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas.- Warner Bros. Discovery stock recently stood 2.8% lower. The company is behind this year's highest-grossing film, ""A Minecraft Movie,"" which was partly filmed in New Zealand and Canada. - Netflix shares lost 3.7%. - Shares in Amazon, Walt Disney and Paramount Global all lost 1.5% or more. Amazon owns Amazon MGM Studios.It isn't clear how such tariffs would work, with Trump saying only in a social-media post that he had authorized the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to immediately begin instituting the tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.""The proclamation potentially marks a new phase of Trump's trade war, since movies aren't physical goods that move through ports.Some overseas locales, including London, have become film-making hubs, aided by tax breaks and infrastructure like large soundstages.

Netflix May Rerate on Accelerating Ad Revenues,1747398934000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX wins bullish reviews after its ad-supported tier hit 94 million monthly active usersup more than 20 million since November and soaring from 40 million in May 2024highlighting accelerating monetization of its $7.99 ad plan versus the $17.99 ad-free entry point.Evercore's Mark Mahaney reiterated a Buy rating with a $1,150 price target following Netflix's annual Upfront Presentation, where management showcased the ad tech platform rollout and new viewership data, while noting that ad viewers now watch 41 hours/month on AVOD. BMO Capital's Brian Pitz also stuck with Buy and a $1,200 target, citing positive second-half 2025 monetization tailwinds from the upcoming Ad Suite launch in EMEA and a planned 2026 rollout of AI-powered ad formats. Seaport Research's David Joyce lifted his target to $1,230, praising Netflix's in-house ad capabilities and flexibility across formats even as subscription price hikes and membership growth continue to underpin the majority of revenue. The FT-reported upgrades reflect growing confidence that Netflix can parlay ad traction into material revenue, offsetting subscriber-growth plateaus in mature markets. Analyst commentary underscored that with advertising now accounting for a growing share of overall ARPU, Netflix may unlock a multi-year ad-revenue catalyst. Why it matters: stronger ad-tier engagement and rising price targets suggest Netflix's valuation could re-rate as investors price in incremental revenue from AVOD.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:880dcb7e4094b:0-netflix-may-rerate-on-accelerating-ad-revenues/
"Shares of Hollywood Studios, Streamers Fall After Trump's Film-Tariff Proposal",1746443160000,"By Rob CurranShares of Hollywood-studio and streaming-services owners fell after President Trump's proposal to impose hefty tariffs on movies made overseas.On Sunday, President Trump said he had authorized a 100% tariff on films produced overseas, saying he was responding to tax incentives that have lured some productions abroad.Movie executives were blindsided, and scrambled to determine the potential impact, The Wall Street Journal reported.Shares of Warner Bros Discovery, which operates the Max streaming service and HBO cable channel in addition to a major Hollywood studio, fell 2.7% to $8.31 premarket. Many major Warner Brothers releases, including recent hits such as ""Mickey 17"" and ""A Minecraft Movie,"" are produced overseas, reflecting decades-long trends in Hollywood.Shares of Netflix, which produced its recent hit series ""Adolescence"" in the U.K. and has a strong international presence, fell 5% to $1,098.50 premarket.Shares of Paramount Global, owner of the Paramount studio, fell 2% to $11.20.

Netflix Stock Gets a Price-Target Hike. Why It Still Has Upside After a Great Run. — Barrons.com,1747394880000,"By George GloverNetflix is on a stellar run — but the video streamer's shares could still have upside thanks to their tariff resilience and new series of Stranger Things and Bridgerton.That's the view of Seaport Research Partners analyst David Joyce, who rates the red-hot tech stock at a Buy. He raised his price target to $1,230 from $1,060 Thursday — that implies shares could rise about 4.4% from their current level.Those aren't eye-popping gains, but Joyce said he sees Netflix as more of ""a core holding with limited downside"" and ""a good buy-on-the-dip candidate."" He expects the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to jump 14% to $15.24 billion between the start of this year and the end of 2026, citing a slate of new content, the success of the streamer's ad-supported tiers, and subscription price hikes.Joyce added that the stock's ""recession-resilience during the spring market turbulence"" should also boost their appeal. The stock is up about 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a broad and brutal market selloff. Investors see it as a safe haven because Netflix imports content, rather than goods. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 5% over the same period.This week, Barron's argued that Netflix stock remains a Buy despite its lofty valuation, with its margin likely to grow at a fast enough rate to maintain momentum.The streamer's own executives are also targeting further gains. They're aiming to double revenue and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter. As of Thursday's close, Netflix had a market capitalization of just over $500 billion.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

However, this momentum may be difficult to sustain. In the fiscal second quarter, Disney expects its Sports segment operating income to be adversely impacted by approximately $100 million due to college sports costs, including the shift of three College Football Playoff games from the previous quarter into the fiscal second quarter and one additional NFL game. Disney also guided that the fiscal second-quarter will be unfavorably impacted by a write-off of more than $50 million as a result of exiting the Venu joint venture.Our model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenues) are pegged at $10.31 billion, indicating an increase of 5.2% year over year.The Experiences segment, which includes Disney's theme parks and cruise line business, also faces challenges. For the fiscal second quarter, Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses of more than $40 million are expected to have weighed on results. For the full fiscal year, total pre-opening expenses related to Disney Cruise Line expansion are projected to reach more than $200 million. These expenses represent significant near-term costs without immediate revenue offsets.Our model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $8.93 billion, indicating 6.4% growth year over year.While Disney's streaming services appear to be gaining traction with the ESPN tile on Disney+ showing encouraging early indications and fiscal first-quarter Entertainment Direct-To-Consumer results reflecting improved profitability with nearly $300 million in operating income, continued subscriber growth remains uncertain. For the upcoming results, management expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers compared to the fiscal first quarter, suggesting ongoing challenges in maintaining subscriber momentum.The company's recent ventures into original programming for Disney+, such as the new daily sports show SC+ and the 24/7 Simpsons stream, represent strategic investments that may not yield immediate returns. Meanwhile, the recent transaction to combine Hulu+ Live TV assets with fuboTV creates additional integration complexity and execution risk.Disney's acquisition of a 70% stake in Fubo will require regulatory approvals and Fubo shareholder approval, introducing uncertainty around timing and potential regulatory hurdles. This transaction, while potentially beneficial long-term, represents one of several moving pieces in Disney's complex business transformation.From a financial perspective, Disney delivered strong consolidated first-quarter fiscal 2025 results with 44% growth in diluted earnings per share excluding certain items, 5% growth in revenues, and 31% growth in total segment operating income. However, these results might have set expectations too high for the fiscal second quarter, given the aforementioned headwinds.Looking forward, management continues to expect high-single digit adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, but achieving this target depends on successful execution across multiple fronts. Given the anticipated challenges and valuation concerns in the fiscal second quarter, investors should consider taking profits ahead of earnings and potentially re-establishing positions at more favorable entry points after gaining greater clarity on Disney's trajectory for the remainder of fiscal 2025.Price Performance & Stock ValuationShares of DIS have lost 16.9% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and peers. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix NFLX, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast CMCSA-owned Peacock and HBO Max.Year-to-Date PerformanceValuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 1.72X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s 1.39X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company’s debt balance of $45.3 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $6 billion.DIS’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched ValuationInvestment Considerations Ahead of Q2 ResultsDisney's premium valuation appears increasingly difficult to justify ahead of the fiscal second-quarter results. While the company delivered strong performance in the previous quarter, several headwinds loom on the horizon. The Sports segment faces a $100 million impact from college sports costs and an additional $50 million write-off from exiting the Venu joint venture. Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses will add another $40 million burden. Management expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers, undermining streaming momentum. The Fubo acquisition introduces regulatory uncertainty, while competition intensifies across all business segments. Despite strategic investments in original programming and platform enhancements, DIS' current valuation doesn't adequately reflect these near-term challenges. Investors should consider reducing exposure before fiscal second-quarter earnings reveal the full impact of these operational headwinds.Final ThoughtDisney's near-term outlook appears challenging despite robust fiscal first-quarter results. With anticipated Sports segment headwinds of $150 million, Cruise Line pre-opening expenses, and projected Disney+ subscriber declines, the company faces multiple operational pressures. These factors, combined with Fubo acquisition uncertainties and intensifying competition across all segments, suggest the premium valuation is increasingly difficult to justify.

Netflix says ad-supported service has 94 million subscribers,1747254290000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX said on Wednesday 94 million subscribers use its advertising-supported tier, up from 70 million in November, as the video-streaming giant's lower-priced plan sees strong support amid global economic uncertainty.With more than 300 million global customers, Netflix is seeing robust spending across all streaming tiers and had said in April it is not seeing any significant shifts in consumer spending. The comments allayed investor concerns that economic uncertainty due to the shifting U.S. trade policy would prompt consumers to cut discretionary spending on streaming services.Netflix had last month said the ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available.To attract more global users, Netflix rolled out enhanced language options for television viewers earlier this year, offering more dubbing and subtitle options. Many of Netflix's most popular media are foreign-made such as South Korean drama ""Squid Game"" and Spanish series ""Money Heist"".Foreign-made films were threatened with a 100% tariff by President Donald Trump in May in an attempt to boost domestic productions, clouding the outlook for media firms such as Netflix, which film overseas.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RM13P:0-netflix-says-ad-supported-service-has-94-million-subscribers/"

Warner Bros Discovery revives HBO Max branding for global push,1747236010000,"Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD is hitting rewind on Max's branding, bringing back the HBO name it dropped from the streaming service two years ago.The company will rebrand its streaming platform as HBO Max this summer, betting that the iconic brand's global reputation will drive subscriber growth as it expands internationally.The return to HBO Max also marks an ""implicit promise"" by the company to deliver unique and premium content, WBD said on Wednesday. HBO is home to some of the most popular, critically-acclaimed series including ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Detective."" ""Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead,"" CEO David Zaslav said.WBD's decision to drop HBO from HBO Max in 2023 followed its move to merge HBO dramas and top franchises like ""Harry Potter"" with lifestyle-focused content from Discovery under one service.The goal was to offer a more appealing product and to help retain viewers who typically canceled their subscriptions after watching the latest season of their favorite show.But it saw strong backlash from audiences. Even Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , called the move a surprise. ""I would have never guessed HBO would have gone away. They put all that effort into one thing that they can tell the consumer - it should be HBO,"" he said in a Variety interview in March. Streaming has become a major growth area for WBD as its cable TV business suffers from cord-cutting. Shows including ""The White Lotus"" and ""The Pitt"" helped it amass 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the January-March quarter, taking its total to 122.3 million. The company expects its subscriber base to exceed 150 million by the end of 2026. A key driver of that growth has been international expansion. After rolling out Max in over 70 countries last year, WBD plans to launch the service in the UK, Ireland, Italy and Germany.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RM1EJ:0-warner-bros-discovery-revives-hbo-max-branding-for-global-push/"
Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies to save 'dying' Hollywood,1746407454000,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers.""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,"" Trump said on Truth Social.Trump said he was authorizing the relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.He added: ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X: ""We're on it."" Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on how the tariffs would be implemented. It was unclear if the tariffs would apply to movies on streaming services as well as those shown in theaters, or if they would be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue. Hollywood executives were trying to sort out details on Sunday night. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the major studios, had no immediate comment. In January, Trump appointed Hollywood veterans Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson to bring Hollywood back ""bigger, better and stronger than ever before.""Movie and TV production has been exiting Hollywood for years, heading to locations with tax incentives that make filming cheaper. Governments around the world have increased credits and cash rebates to attract productions and capture a greater share of the $248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.All major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain. Shares in Disney, Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD , Paramount Global NASDAQ:PARA and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN were lower in early trade on Monday.On Monday, leaders in Australia and New Zealand responded to Trump's tariff announcement by saying they would advocate for their local industries. Some Marvel superhero movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was the backdrop for ""The Lord of the Rings"" films.The British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the government to move swiftly to protect the country's ""vital"" film industry. ""These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,"" said Bectu head Philippa Childs. She said they would also threaten tens of thousands of jobs of freelancers who make films in the UK. Film and high-end TV production in the UK was worth 5.6 billion pounds ($7.45 billion) in 2024, a 31% increase over 2023, according to the British Film Institute. The government's Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 'LOT MORE TO LOSE THAN TO GAIN'In 2023, about half of the spending by U.S. producers on movie and TV projects with budgets of more than $40 million went outside the U.S., according to research firm ProdPro. ""I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),"" said Scott Roxborough, Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter. Film and television production has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade in Hollywood's home city of Los Angeles, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region's production.The January wildfires accelerated concerns that producers may look outside Los Angeles, and that camera operators, costume designers, sound technicians and other behind-the-scenes workers may move out of town rather than try to rebuild in their neighborhoods. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most preferred place to film in the next two years, behind Toronto, Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia. Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state's tax incentives to better compete with other locations. Trump's proposed movie tariff follows a series of trade conflicts initiated by his administration, which have roiled markets and led to fears of a U.S. recession.Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump's film tariffs would be devastating.""The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,"" he said, adding it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.

Top Streaming Content Stocks to Keep an Eye on for Solid Gains,1746206220000,"An updated edition of the March 12, 2025 article.The entertainment industry has dramatically evolved over the past 20 years, shifting from conventional cable TV to the era of on-demand digital streaming. While early streaming trials appeared in the 1990s, real momentum came with YouTube’s launch in 2005 and Netflix’s rollout of its video-on-demand service in 2007. The combination of faster broadband, widespread smartphone adoption and changing consumer habits has made streaming the leading mode of media consumption. Industry giants like Alphabet GOOGL, Netflix NFLX and Roku ROKU have capitalized on this trend.Streaming allows users to play audio and video online instantly, without downloading entire files, offering smooth playback and minimal buffering. This ease of access — across smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs — has revolutionized how people engage with media. Viewers are drawn to the flexibility of watching content anytime, anywhere, often with fewer ads than traditional broadcasts. To stay competitive, streaming platforms are pouring resources into exclusive and original content, fueling fierce competition known as the “content wars.”Several trends continue to propel the sector’s growth: increasing global internet access, a surge in mobile viewing and AI-driven recommendation systems that personalize the user experience. The rise of connected devices, from gaming consoles to smart TVs, has also widened the market for streaming services. By 2029, the global video streaming market is expected to generate $190 billion annually from 2 billion paid subscriptions, according to research by Ampere Analysis. While Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) dominates, Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV (FAST) and hybrid offerings are gaining steam. Sports streaming and interactive features like live events and gaming are also driving deeper engagement.For investors, streaming stocks present a compelling opportunity, with leading companies boosting revenues through pricing adjustments, global market expansion and the growth of ad-supported models. Efforts in content localization and strategic alliances are also extending international reach, reinforcing streaming’s status as a dynamic and profitable investment space.So, if you want to join the bandwagon, our Streaming Content Thematic Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time.

Its commitment to delivering diverse content across multiple genres has played a crucial role in boosting user engagement. Additionally, the increasing participation of prominent Hollywood actors enhances the appeal of its films and series. NFLX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Netflix continues to gain from its expanding subscriber base, fueled by a strong mix of localized and foreign-language content and solid user engagement. Its emphasis on regional programming has been a key driver of international expansion. The company is broadening its content slate with projects underway in India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and across the Middle East. To strengthen its presence in price-sensitive markets, Netflix has rolled out affordable mobile plans in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Netflix has set its sights on an ambitious target that has caught the attention of investors worldwide, doubling its revenues by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. Its growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division and building its advertising business. These strategic initiatives are expected to drive significant revenue and profit growth in the coming years. Moreover, the ad-supported subscription tier is becoming a significant success story for Netflix.Alphabet’s YouTube is the world’s largest video-sharing platform. Since launching its subscription-based YouTube TV service in 2017, it has become a major player in the cord-cutting market. Leveraging a dual-revenue model — advertising and premium subscriptions — YouTube stands out as one of the most financially resilient streaming services.The platform continues to expand its investment in creator-driven content, short-form videos through YouTube Shorts and exclusive sports streaming rights. Its leadership in user-generated content, combined with AI-enhanced content discovery, delivers a formidable competitive edge. Moreover, the growing influence of creator-led marketing and monetization opportunities via the YouTube Partner Program strengthens its revenue streams.Alphabet’s ongoing investments in AI are fueling consistent growth and increased watch time across both YouTube’s ad-supported and premium offerings. In 2024, globally, viewers streamed more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs. Additionally, the platform’s focus on podcasts is enhancing engagement from both creators and audiences, with more than 400 million hours of podcasts watched monthly on living room devices alone. YouTube Shorts is also gaining momentum, with the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increasing more than 30% in 2024. With the ongoing shift toward digital-first video consumption, YouTube continues to experience strong growth, solidifying its position as a dominant force in the future of streaming. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Roku ranks as the top TV streaming platform by hours streamed across the United States, Canada and Mexico. It began as a streaming device company in 2008 but has since transformed into a comprehensive streaming platform.The company is experiencing strong growth in streaming households, driven by sales of stand-alone streaming devices, collaborations with TV brands such as TCL, JVC, Sharp and other major TV makers who license the Roku OS to manufacture and sell Roku TV models, and licensing of the Roku OS to certain service operators.Additionally, Roku is capitalizing on advertising growth fueled by rising monetized video ad impressions spurred by the growing popularity of The Roku Channel. This momentum is supported by sustained interest from traditional TV advertisers shifting to streaming, along with continued investment in its OneView ad platform and broader ad tech infrastructure. ROKU carries a Zacks Rank #3.Roku bridges content publishers and users at scale, offering a robust suite of promotional tools to boost engagement and reach. The company is gaining from the broad availability of third-party streaming channels and ongoing investment in The Roku Channel.

These companies are emerging as potential winners in Trump's trade war,1746205320000,"By James RogersThis earnings season, companies in some sectors have started spelling out the potential financial impact of tariffs, while others have withdrawn their outlooks citing too much uncertaintyThe fallout from President Trump's sweeping tariffs agenda is casting a long shadow over earnings season as companies wrestle with the unfolding trade war, but there are also glimmers of opportunity amid the uncertainty, according to LPL Financial.Despite the market turmoil, names in some sectors are spelling out the financial impact of tariffs, while others have pulled their guidance, saying that the economic outlook is too uncertain. A handful of names have even cited potential benefits from the tariffs climate.Set against this backdrop, Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted opportunities in a note released this week. He categorizes this current period as ""phase one,"" characterized as ""peak uncertainty and peak tariffs,"" with ""phase two"" the period ""after the tariff dust settles.""""We believe consumer staples, real estate, and gold are well positioned for the current phase of uncertainty,"" wrote Buchbinder.He acknowledged, however, that not all consumer staples companies will be immune.Domestic packaged food companies are relatively insulated thanks to specialty crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados and chocolate falling within the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, he said. ""On the other hand, dollar stores and supercenters are not immune due to a reliance on goods from China and will be forced to raise prices or adjust supply chains after inventories are depleted,"" Buchbinder added.Related: GE Healthcare sees tariffs costing $500 million in 2025, then much less next yearBuchbinder said empty shelves are a real risk, and that imports of alcoholic beverages and spirits could be a point of pain. He also mentions the impact of cumulative price increases, ongoing sticky inflation and elevated consumer borrowing.""That said, given staples are more 'needs' than 'wants' and revenues typically hold up well in an economic slowdown, we'll put consumer staples in the phase-one winner category,"" he added.However, Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the parent of household brands including Pampers, Gillette, Crest and Tide, cut its earnings outlook last week amid worries about higher prices from tariffs and a slowing economy. Toothpaste and soap maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) also cut its guidance last week.Parts of the healthcare sector also stand to benefit from the current tariffs climate, according to LPL Financial.""It would be logical to put the defensive healthcare sector among the phase one winners, but pharmaceuticals are in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's trade policy,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""Sectoral tariffs could rattle the sector, pending successful country-level negotiations.""However, the analyst sees opportunity around medical devices. ""On the medical equipment side, tariff exposure is relatively limited, with the most exposed companies generating 12% or less of their revenue in China and most manufacturing housed in the U.S., so that group may be a phase one winner,"" he wrote.The healthcare sector has been breaking down the financial cost of tariffs in recent weeks.Medical technology company GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (GEHC) said earlier this week that the impact of the global tariffs war will cost it around $500 million at current rates and cut its full-year profit outlook. And medical-device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT) estimated recently that tariffs will cost it ""a few hundred million dollars"" this year, but reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Related: Procter & Gamble sees consumers hit 'pause' amid tariffs, job-market uncertaintyLast week, drugmaker Merck & Co. (MRK) said that its reaffirmed 2025 outlook absorbs an estimated $200 million in additional costs for already implemented tariffs. Medical-technology and drug company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) estimated that tariffs could result in about $400 million in extra costs and raised its sales outlook.Financials are also a phase-one winner because of the sector's limited exposure to goods imports, according to LPL Financial, although cyclicality also makes them a potential winner in phase two.For phase two, LPL Financial sees the communication services sector as a potential winner, with ""honorable mentions"" for technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials.In communication services, LPL Financial points to solid first-quarter results from Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX).""The key risk, beyond regulatory pressures on the big internet companies, is that tariff rates don't come down as much as we anticipate, weighing on margins in this space, although the effects on the digital media segment of the sector are quite manageable,"" Buchbinder wrote.He believes the tech sector could easily grow earnings 20% this year as AI investment continues but says that technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. ""The sector has underperformed since July of 2024,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""We also worry about semiconductor industry disruptions from U.S.-China trade tensions,"" he added, noting that this has challenged Nvidia Corp.'s performance lately.Software appears better positioned for this environment than semiconductors, according to LPL Financial. The financial services company also notes that tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) has significant operations in China that will not be cheap or quick to move away from.Related: Here's how GM is dealing with tariff uncertainty: pulling guidance, halting stock buybackMeanwhile, consumer discretionary, which sell what people ""want,"" is heavily impacted by the tariffs regime.""Tariffs on apparel makers, autos, and home construction materials (primarily lumber) are particularly biting, while policy uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence and contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending,"" wrote Buchbinder.On Thursday car giant General Motors Co. (GM) slashed its profit guidance and said that it expects tariffs to cost up to $5 billion.Elsewhere in consumer discretionary, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) kept its full-year profit outlook intact and described tariffs as ""manageable,"" while rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) cut its full-year outlook.Household products maker Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) said that tariffs could actually benefit its business and maintained much of its 2025 outlook. Consumer-facing washer and dryer maker Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) also said that it could be a ""winner"" under the new tariffs regime and kept its full-year guidance unchanged.However, airlines are a different story, with American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) pulling their guidance amid macroeconomic uncertainty.LPL Financial acknowledges that, while consumer discretionary is one of the sectors hardest hit by tariffs, it makes sense that it would benefit if levies come down.""But the uncertainty is still too high right now and a neutral stance seems prudent,"" Buchbinder wrote.-James RogersThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

3 Reasons Why Disney Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q2 Earnings Beat,1747139040000,"Disney DIS delivered impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues, demonstrating strong momentum across its business segments. (Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)With shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.Impressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic ExecutionDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.These results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.The Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.Direct-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share. These projections suggest steady growth ahead.(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Streaming Profitability Achieved as Content Drives GrowthAfter years of heavy investment in its streaming platforms, Disney has successfully navigated the challenging transition from traditional media to direct-to-consumer models. The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.Disney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.The company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash . These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.Disney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.Shares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+. While Netflix has returned 24.5% year to date, shares of Amazon and Apple have lost 4.9% and 15.85%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceMultiple Growth Catalysts on the HorizonLooking ahead, Disney has several compelling growth catalysts that should drive shareholder value in the coming years.In sports, ESPN delivered its most-watched second quarter in primetime ever, with viewership among the key 18-49 demographic up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by marquee events like the USA/Canada 4 Nations Championship and Women's College Basketball, which saw its most-watched regular season in 16 years.The company is preparing to launch ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, which should further strengthen its position as the preeminent digital sports platform.Meanwhile, the Experiences segment delivered strong results, with Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income growing 13% compared to the prior-year quarter. At Disney Cruise Line, the Disney Treasure is now in its second full quarter of operations, with two more cruise ships joining the fleet later this year.Most impressive is Disney's unprecedented pipeline of expansion projects around the world, creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California. This includes special celebrations for Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary and Disneyland's historic 70th anniversary.The Bottom Line: Disney Offers Compelling Value at a DiscountBased on its strong second-quarter results and improved outlook, Disney stock appears significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company currently trades at just 19.25 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings, notably below the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry average of 21.37 times. This valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a premium media brand.DIS’ 3-Year P/E TTM Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationManagement has confidently raised guidance for fiscal 2025, now expecting adjusted EPS of approximately $5.75, representing a 16% increase over fiscal 2024. The company also projects approximately $17 billion in cash provided by operations, suggesting a $2 billion increase over prior guidance. This robust cash flow enables continued investments in growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through the company's share repurchase program.ConclusionWith its streaming services now profitable, box office hits driving multi-channel revenues, significant expansion projects underway in the Parks segment, and a valuation below industry averages, Disney offers investors exposure to multiple growth vectors with increasingly solid financial fundamentals. For investors looking for a blue-chip media and entertainment company with both defensive characteristics and growth potential, DIS stock appears to be a compelling buy at current levels.

Roku trims annual revenue forecast as economic uncertainty weighs,1746130373000,"Roku NASDAQ:ROKU trimmed its annual revenue expectations and forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates on Thursday, due to economic uncertainty and tariff-related concerns, sending its shares down 4.9% in after-hours trading.Roku faces tough competition from tech giants such as Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , which offer similar streaming devices: the Amazon Fire TV Stick and Apple TV, respectively.This intensified competition continues to pressure Roku to defend its market share.The company's devices segment — which includes Roku-branded TVs and streaming players — is projected to see a revenue decline of about 10% year-over-year.Roku also said it is challenging to forecast tariff-related impacts in its devices segment.""While there is more macro uncertainty than normal, we are providing our best outlook based on our current visibility and what we are observing in our business,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.The company expects net revenue of $4.55 billion for the full year, compared to its previous forecast of $4.61 billion.

"Jon Voight, Hollywood coalition asks Trump to consider tax incentives",1747086230000,"A coalition of American film industry unions and guilds, joined by veteran actor Jon Voight, has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to consider implementing tax incentives in his push to promote domestic film productions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. Along with Voight, the letter was signed by Sylvester Stallone and Teamsters union general president Sean O'Brien, among others. They call for Trump to support the inclusion of three film-friendly tax measures in a reconciliation package being drafted in Congress. Voight and Stallone were also appointed by Trump as special ambassadors to Hollywood to strengthen the industry and bring filmmaking back to the country.""Returning more production to the United States will require a national approach and broad-based policy solutions, including those we propose below as well as longer term initiatives such as implementing a federal film and television tax incentive,"" the letter read. Major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain as governments around the world introduce credits and rebates to attract film productions. Trump threw the entertainment industry into a flux earlier this month when he announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering.The move left a lot of questions unanswered, such as when the duties would be implemented and how they would be enforced — as different components of a film are made in different countries and then assembled through post-production. Trump's tariff pronouncement followed his meeting with Voight along with other executives and advisers to mull a range of ideas to to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1SD:0-jon-voight-hollywood-coalition-asks-trump-to-consider-tax-incentives/"
9 Stocks That Are Close to New Highs Despite Market Turmoil — Barrons.com,1746120480000,"By Teresa RivasAs stocks swooned in response to the so-called Liberation Day tariff news, it seemed April would be the cruelest month, to borrow a phrase from T.S. Eliot. Yet by month's end, it was far from a wasteland.As stocks closed on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was down less than 1% compared with before President Donald Trump unveiled a 10% tariff on nearly all countries, plus higher ""reciprocal"" levies on many more. The Nasdaq Composite had eked out a gain.Nonetheless, some scars remain. On Thursday, the first trading day of May, none of the stocks in the S&P 100 opened at record levels, despite stocks making broad-based gains. Philip Morris and Netflix closed at new highs on Wednesday, but slipped back as trading began on Thursday.Nine S&P 100 stocks — Philip Morris, Netflix, Berkshire Hathaway, Duke Energy, McDonald's, Southern Company, Coca-Cola, Palantir Technologies, and Booking Holdings — were within 5% of record levels. That eclectic group reflects the market's mood last month.As a defensive name, Philip Morris shone throughout April as investors fled to safety, while also delivering upbeat quarterly results near the end of the month. The company's chief financial officer spoke with Barron's following the report, noting that Philip Morris continues to benefit from the shift away from traditional cigarettes.The story was largely the same for Coca-Cola. The consumer-staple stalwart had been doing well even before reporting a strong first quarter and noting that tariffs would be ""manageable.""Many investors felt they could do worse during times of turmoil than following in the footsteps of Warren Buffett, although Berkshire Hathaway was nearly flat in April, as was utility Duke Energy. Berkshire will report its results on Saturday, while Duke is scheduled to do so on Tuesday. Fellow utility Southern wasn't doing much on Thursday, despite reporting a better-than-expected quarter.A strong quarter was just icing on the cake for Netflix, which soared throughout April. Streaming video, the company's main business, is a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment, and Spotify is fairly well integrated into the countries where it operates. The result is that many investors believe it is insulated from the trade war and any economic slowdown it brings.McDonald's reported a disappointing first quarter on Thursday. Restaurants have been a tough space in general as nervous consumers pull back on dining out. Still, given its size and inexpensive meals, McDonald's has a somewhat defensive reputation, and was still up throughout April.In tech, Palantir wasn't only an April winner, but one of the best performers through the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency. Investors continue to buy the stock because of the potential growth of its artificial intelligence-powered software business.Booking, the online travel agency formerly known as Priceline, was up roughly 10% last month. Although investors are worried about travel demand in light of uncertainty swirling around policy, trade, and the broader economy, the company's first quarter was strong and management said demand was stable. Booking is one of the larger and more established players in the industry, so it is often seen as one of the safer bets during downturns.In short, although early April's carnage has healed to a degree because Trump has walked back some tariffs and investors are hopeful the economy will avoid the worst potential outcomes, not many stocks gained last month. Shares with decent defensive characteristics or company-specific reasons for potential gains were the exception.Here's hoping for a calmer May.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla to Debut Self-Driving Taxi in June as Robotaxi Wars Begin,1747080000000,"Disrupt or be DisruptedTechnological advances are always at the heart of disruption on Wall Street, and thus, the most profitable long-term trend opportunities. However, it will mean a slow, painful death for companies who fail to adapt and evolve. Conversely, the rewards are substantial for companies that respond to market changes and debut new technologies. For instance, Blockbuster Video did little to adapt when Netflix ( NFLX ) first began its mail-order DVD service (which later morphed into a streaming service). The result? Blockbuster went bust, and Netflix would become one of the best-performing stocks of the 2000s.Why Robotaxis are Taking OverOver the past few months, the idea of autonomous vehicles has gone from dream to reality. Advancements in artificial intelligence, software, cameras, and sensors have made this possible. Robotaxis provide several benefits, including:- Safety: Drive on the road for more than a half hour in any major US city and you are likely to witness at least one driver glancing down at their Apple ( AAPL ) Pphone. Robotaxis promise to reduce human error and distraction, reducing the number of accidents. - Cost Reduction: By eliminating the need for human drivers, ride-hailing operators can become far more profitable. - More Vehicles: Because robotaxis don’t need to take breaks like humans (outside of recharging), they can run nearly 24/7, increasing the number of vehicles on the road, improving customer wait times while increasing profitability.The Robotaxi Wars are HereThus far, Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) “Waymo” service is the undisputed king of robotaxis. Waymo is the first major robotaxi player to gain regulatory clearance, operates in four US cities (with plans to add two more), and its paid robotaxi business has exploded to more than 250,000 paid rides per week. Meanwhile, Waymo has inked a strategic partnership with Uber Technologies ( UBER ), operator of the most-extensive ride-sharing application and network.Tesla Will Enter the Robotaxi Market in JuneWhile Tesla ( TSLA ) and its visionary CEO Elon Musk, are behind in the robotaxi wars, the race to robotaxi supremacy is in the early innings. Musk has said several times over that past few years that he is “betting the company” on autonomous vehicle technology and believes that robotaxis will revolutionize transportation and potentially increase the value of a Tesla by fivefold. Though Tesla’s robotaxi debut has been delayed several times, Tesla has finally begun testing its robotaxi service with employees in Austin, Texas. Next month, Tesla will start to roll out its robotaxi to customers through its in-house built mobile application.Waymo vs. Tesla: Who Will Win the Robotaxi War? Waymo has an early advantage in the robotaxi war. While Tesla has yet to launch, Waymo is a proven entity that is well on its way to reaching scale. That said, it is far too early to count Tesla out. A critical difference between Waymo and Tesla robotaxis is cost. Waymo autonomous vehicles are far more expensive than Tesla robotaxis. Because Waymo leverages expensive LiDAR, radar, cameras, and AI, it can cost about $180,000! Conversely, Tesla robotaxis will only rely on computer vision AI, costing about $50,000 to produce.Image Source: @teslaownersvIn other words, while Tesla is behind in the robotaxi race, its lower cost could allow it to catch up in scale and also enjoy jucier profit margins in the long run.Bottom LineWhile Waymo currently holds a significant lead, Tesla’s impending entry (with game-changing cost advantage) injects uncertainty into the future landscape of autonomous transportation. It means the robotaxi wars may just be starting.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:aba92c91b094b:0-tesla-to-debut-self-driving-taxi-in-june-as-robotaxi-wars-begin/
Formula One's Long — and Successful — Race to Crack America — Journal Report,1746108000000,"By Joshua Robinson and Jonathan CleggNot so long ago — before Formula One was organizing races down the Las Vegas Strip, or in the Miami sunshine, or for half a million fans in Austin, Texas — the U.S. was the one place on earth that felt agonizingly out of reach for the world's most prestigious racing series.It wasn't for lack of trying. Ever since F1 began in 1950, organizers had brought Grand Prix races to the U.S., desperately hoping to seduce the American market that understood and embraced its traditionally oval-track motor sports, Nascar and IndyCar. But everywhere they went, the F1 traveling circus ran into a mix of misfortune, incompetence and, worst of all, indifference.In Vegas in the 1980s, F1 was relegated to racing in the parking lot of Caesars Palace. In Indianapolis, a tire fiasco led to a race featuring only six cars, instead of the planned 20. And in Phoenix, Formula One was once outdrawn by an ostrich festival held on the same weekend. To American fans, this English-driven sport might as well have been speaking a different language.""In the old times, F1 was too presumptuous,"" F1 Chief Executive Stefano Domenicali says. ""Formula One was coming to the U.S. [as if] there was nothing to explain.""Now, with F1 in its 75th season, the picture couldn't be more different. With a devoted stateside following and a genuine cultural toehold, the sport has gone far beyond simply cracking a U.S. market that former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone had all but given up on. In 2025, Formula One has put America squarely at the center of its business.A new realityThis surprising turn toward the U.S. began when the series was acquired by the Colorado-based Liberty Media in 2017 for more than $4 billion. At the time, there was only one Grand Prix a year in America, in Austin, and ratings were almost negligible.It took the sudden success of Netflix's F1 reality show, ""Drive to Survive,"" during the early part of the pandemic in 2019 to jump-start interest from U.S. audiences. In 2022, F1 added a second American Grand Prix in Miami, and the following year it launched the Vegas Strip race.Each one comes with a distinct vibe. If Austin is the closest thing to a race in the European heartland, with its petrolhead music-festival ambience, Miami was designed to be Monaco on Biscayne Bay. Vegas, meanwhile, was imagined as the over-the-top, one-of-a-kind spectacle created specifically for the ""Drive to Survive"" generation. Last season, those three Grand Prix weekends drew more than a million fans combined, on par with the most popular European races.But the sport's brass isn't letting up on its American push. Its latest crossover project, a blockbuster movie called ""F1"" starring Brad Pitt and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, will hit theaters this summer. And next year the sport will expand to admit Cadillac, backed by General Motors, as the 11th F1 team.The reason for such a concerted push on this side of the Atlantic is that in the U.S., F1 has tapped into the kind of audience that advertisers salivate over. They're young, affluent and more gender-balanced than your average sports crowd, with an average age of 35 and roughly 60% men and 40% women, F1 says.Never mind that they might not have been watching during the heyday of such F1 luminaries as Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s, or even during Lewis Hamilton's prime in the 2010s. The new fans who surfed in on the ""Drive to Survive"" wave adopted the current cast of drivers as their own and helped F1 gain unprecedented cultural relevance in the U.S.""We are feeling that explosion in the sport, of the popularity of the sport, and it's with a different generation,"" says Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll. ""They're able to follow it on their phone. They don't have to sit home at 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon or watch it on TV.""That's not necessarily ideal for a sport that hasn't entirely moved past the traditional moneymaking model of raking in cash through the sale of television rights. All of that stateside popularity has yet to turn into the American broadcast deal of F1's dreams.ESPN, which was paying exactly $0 for the rights to the series as recently as 2018, chose to walk away from its exclusive negotiation window for a new package late last year. F1, which is reportedly seeking between $150 million and $180 million a season, declined to comment on negotiations with prospective broadcast partners, but said it was confident it would secure a contract soon.Driver wantedOne thing that could change the calculus would be the arrival of an American driver.F1 hasn't had an American world champion since Mario Andretti in 1978, and no one has come close. In fact, no American has won so much as a single Grand Prix since that season. The most recent driver to give it a try was the Florida-born Logan Sargeant, whose stay in F1 lasted less than two seasons. His best race finish was 10th place.Everyone in the sport knows how much of an impact a competitive U.S. driver could have. When Schumacher dominated the series, he single-handedly revived F1 interest in his native Germany. Fernando Alonso did the same for Spain late in the first decade of the 2000s. And now that Max Verstappen is a four-time world champion, hordes of Dutch fans in orange gear are a fixture at circuits around the world.The hope in F1 circles now is that Cadillac can be the team to foster the next promising U.S. racer. But Formula One isn't waiting around for that lightning to strike. Rumors have been circulating for over a year that the sport is on the hunt for yet another American track.Email Joshua Robinson, a Wall Street Journal editor in New York, at joshua.robinson@wsj.com.

Spotify’s Q1 sales rose 11% year over year to $4.4 billion, although this missed estimates of $4.59 billion.Like video streaming king Netflix, Spotify’s subscription growth among its music platform has led to much hype in recent years, with it noteworthy that the company’s net subscribers spiked 12% during Q1 to 268 million. Adding 5 million new net subscribers, Spotify’s monthly active users (MAU) grew by 3 million to 678 million.Spotify’s Guidance & Outlook Providing guidance for the second quarter, Spotify expects to add 11 million MAU and 5 million subscribers. Furthermore, Spotify forecasts Q2 revenue at $4.52 billion or 10% growth, which fell in line with Zacks estimates (Current Qtr Below). Based on Zacks projections, Spotify’s total sales are expected to increase 16% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to spike another 15% in FY26 to $22.55 billion. Notably, the Sweden-based technology firm expects Q2 operating income at 539 million euros and forecasts a 31.5% gross margin.Regarding full-year margins, Spotify continues to expect improvement in 2025 at what it called a more measured pace than last year's exceptional gains as the company strategically invests to accelerate its long-term growth ambitions. SPOT EPS RevisionsSuggesting more upside in Spotify stock is that earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher over the last week. Plus, FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are now up 5% and 8% in the last 60 days, respectively.Spotify’s annual earnings are currently expected to soar 78% this year to $10.61 per share, from EPS of $5.95 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to spike another 31% to $13.95.  Bottom Line Spotify’s rapid expansion is still hard to overlook, with its stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This is largely predicated on the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions even amid its Q1 earnings miss. Correlating with such, it wouldn’t be surprising if the stellar price performance of SPOT continued.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:294f00d5c094b:0-still-time-to-buy-spotify-spot-stock-after-q1-earnings/
"Fox names new streaming service 'Fox One', plans launch before football season",1747052048000,"Fox Corp NASDAQ:FOX said its new subscription-based streaming service will be called ""Fox One"" and is set to launch before the fall American football season as the company seeks to reach audiences beyond its mainstay cable television business.Unveiling details on Monday about the service first announced in February, Fox said pricing for ""Fox One"" would align with its wholesale rates and would not be at a discount.Shares of the company rose 5% as it also surpassed quarterly revenue expectations, thanks to a surge in advertising sales driven by its broadcast of ""Super Bowl LIX"" in February.The Murdoch family-controlled company has largely sat out the streaming race, betting instead on ad revenue from its free Tubi streaming service that has about 97 million monthly active users.Fox will partner with other distributors and services to offer Fox One, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, hinting at potential bundling deals with other streamers — a strategy that has gained traction as companies look to curb subscriber churn.""The pricing will be healthy,"" Murdoch said.Launching the service ahead of the NFL season should drive good initial uptake, regardless of price, said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. But he flagged doubts about how many streaming services the market could sustain.In the March quarter, more advertisers turned to the owner of FOX News, FOX Sports and Tubi to tap its growing viewership. An estimated 127.7 million viewers tuned in for the Super Bowl championship broadcast by Fox, the largest audience in TV history for a single-network telecast. Revenue rose 27% to $4.37 billion in the third quarter, beating an estimate of $4.18 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Advertising revenue surged 65%. Adjusted profit per share of $1.10 beat an estimate of $0.91 per share.FOX News now has more than 200 new advertisers since U.S. Election Day. ""They're sticking on our air and continue to advertise,"" Murdoch said.LightShed Partners expects FOX News will be the ""biggest beneficiary"" in this year's TV advertising upfronts, which are annual events where TV networks and streaming platforms present their upcoming programming to advertisers.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK11T:0-fox-names-new-streaming-service-fox-one-plans-launch-before-football-season/"
Top Founder-Run Company Stocks That Can Drive Solid Returns ,1746035460000,"An updated edition of the March 10, 2025, article.No one is better positioned to understand, nurture and build a company than its founder. Much like a mother devoted to raising her child, founders invest in their ventures with profound passion, unwavering vision and relentless dedication. Their appetite for risk often exceeds that of professional managers, as they willingly embrace new approaches, foster innovation and make bold choices to achieve success. As a result, these companies frequently become genuine manifestations of their founders’ core values and aspirations.However, founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Tesla, Inc . TSLA, Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (BRK.B) and Netflix NFLX. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead.As these companies are born out of a unique idea, they often involve technological innovation. These companies are built from scratch in a way that they can navigate challenges to stay sustainable over the longer term. Initially, others may not relate to a founder’s belief, making it difficult to source funds for the project. The founder often ends up putting personal wealth and savings into such bootstrap companies. If successful, they attract angel investors or raise funds. But it's always the founder-owner whose stake and risk are the highest. Moreover, a founder-owner often finds it difficult to delegate responsibilities as they are skeptical if others could do justice to the role. Thus, they often hold multiple senior/leadership positions and also face difficulties in finding a torchbearer. But one cannot be jack of all trades. Owing to their reluctance to delegate duties, these founders/owners tend to lose out on the benefits of professional expertise.Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like Netflix, Intercontinental Exchange ICE and Affirm Holdings AFRM look appealing. Ready to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

The company evolved from a small DVD rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and strong international footprint. Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. co-founded Netflix with Marc Randolph in 1997 and is the executive chairman of the company.Netflix has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping the company sustain its leading position despite the launch of services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video. NFLX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The company’s focus on streaming regional content has been leading to international growth. Netflix is diversifying its content portfolio and working on projects across India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East. The company has launched low-priced mobile plans in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Moreover, the upcoming lower-priced ad tier is expected to further drive growth in these price-sensitive regions. Netflix’s 2025 priorities include improving its core business with more series and films to offer an enhanced product experience, growth of its ads business, and newer initiatives such as live programming and games. It believes these initiatives should help it sustain healthy growth and thus projects 2025 revenues between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and an operating margin of 29%.Intercontinental Exchange, with a market capitalization of $95.6 billion, has evolved from a small start-up less than three decades ago to a company whose networks help customers manage risk, harness data and improve workflow efficiency. Jeffrey C. Sprecher, founder, chairman & CEO of ICE, stated, “These efforts saw ICE report its 19th consecutive year of record net revenues and record adjusted earnings per share, something we have achieved every year since we’ve been a public company.” Its competitive advantage lies in the digitization of fixed income workflows and automating mortgage manufacturing.With over 5,000 indices representing more than $1 trillion in benchmark assets under management, the company boasts being the second-largest fixed income provider globally. This Zacks Rank #2 company has grown over the past two decades, primarily through buyouts and collaborations that have not only fueled its growth but have also led to achieving expense synergies. Intercontinental Exchange remains well-positioned for growth on the back of accelerated digitization taking place in the U.S. residential mortgage industry to overcome several inefficiencies across the mortgage origination workflow. While the company already boasts the largest mortgage network across the United States, the integration of Ellie Mae into ICE Mortgage Technology is likely to help the company in boosting its mortgage business.A healthy and minimal risk-based balance sheet is likely to continue, providing stability and buoyancy over the medium to long term while supporting strategic investments.Affirm, with a market capitalization of $16.3 billion, a financial technology company, has emerged as a major player in the BNPL space, one of the fastest-growing segments in fintech. Affirm collaborates with merchants to integrate its pay-over-time solutions at the point of sale, boasting over 337,000 active merchant partners as of Dec. 31, 2024, across diverse sectors. Max Levchin, founder and CEO, believes “Affirm is in the strongest shape it’s ever been.”Affirm benefits from organic growth, expanding merchant partnerships, advancing technology and product innovation and expansionary measures. Technology is the backbone of a payments company like Affirm, as it powers the company’s cloud-based, data-driven platform. Affirm uses advanced machine learning and predictive models to assess fraud risk and creditworthiness and personalize services, enabling better risk assessment and pricing. Its proprietary technology, with access to data from 215 million loans, improves efficiency and scalability, creating a moat. Affirm is steadily evolving into a broader financial services platform. This diversification strategy not only expands Affirm’s addressable market but also creates new revenue streams. The company achieved GAAP profitability in the last reported quarter and aims to maintain profitability starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. This Zacks Rank #1 company is also eyeing international growth, with launches planned in Australia and Western Europe.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:16548a683094b:0-top-founder-run-company-stocks-that-can-drive-solid-returns/
New Tariffs Hit Film Industry—What It Means for Netflix,1747048500000,"There are no clear-cut answers in today’s uncertain stock market, as President Trump's recently rolled-out trade tariffs start to hit industries that weren’t considered targets for these trading headwinds. When the announcements started, the attention seemed to be centered on the  technology sector , specifically the semiconductor and chipmaking industry in Asian regions. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] However, these tariffs quickly spilled over into the retail sector and, most recently, into entertainment . As some countries have made little effort to work around a deal with the United States, President Trump has come up with more creative ways to force the market into negotiations, with his latest strategic round of tariffs focused on the movie industry . After announcing a 100% tariff on foreign-made films , all eyes suddenly turned to one stock.Shares of Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on a tear for the entire year, as investors believe that this subscription business could outweigh the volatility brought on by trade tariffs due to its fundamental strengths and the ability of management and analysts to forecast earnings and revenues into the future, aiding in better outlooks and valuations in the future. Here are some angles investors can consider for Netflix on this new development.Price Action: Netflix’s Latest SeriesOver the past 12 months, Netflix's stock delivered a massive 88.8% rally to outperform most of its peers and the broader S&P 500 . This reiterates the fact that as volatility and uncertainty hit the broader financial markets, Netflix was able to attract the attention and preference of investors due to its value proposition .However, over the past week, Netflix stock declined by as much as 4% on the news of these 100% movie tariffs . Even with this adverse reaction initially, there are a few things to consider for the future of the stock that might create more stability and positive outlooks in the coming months and quarters.Costs should be kept front and center when strategizing the potential scenarios that might come from these 100% tariffs, but here’s where the broader market participants think the stock could go next. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:NFLX] Institutions Are Okay With Uncertainty; Here’s WhyEven as Netflix's costs are set to rise , since a growing share of series and movies are produced internationally, not to mention a growing base of foreign users, there seems to be one clear advantage that Netflix can implement in the face of this new situation it has found itself in.With such a massive presence in the entertainment industry, not to mention its large market share and growing footprint across the globe , Netflix has a few ways to get around these new tariffs. One of the first, but not so obvious, is that Netflix can simply insource production in the United States for foreign creators to avoid some of these tariffs.Doing this would absolutely help the company in two ways. First, it can offset some of the significant added costs associated with importing foreign films. Second, it can gain political goodwill by bringing more production and exposure to the American scenery. This would mean added investment in the country , which might bring on potential grants and credits . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] That one can be a little complicated because it rests on many assumptions and multiple-choice options for the company and other producers. A more straightforward strategy might come from the brand’s leverage and pricing power , avoiding some of the hoops that need to be jumped through to onshore production and further logistics.This simpler alternative is to  raise prices , which might be seen as negative at first because the initial assumption is that higher prices will lower future demand. However, when investors zoom out, it isn’t just Netflix that has this problem; it is pretty much all the others in the entertainment industry .Knowing this, it becomes a race to see who is first to raise prices and lock in the additional audience before everyone else is either forced to take on the logistical onshoring or raise prices to avoid such heavy lifting. With both scenarios pointing to a Netflix win , it’s no surprise that some of the largest institutions warm up to owning more Netflix stock.Such as those from Natixis Advisors , who decided to boost their holdings in Netflix stock by 1% as of May 2025. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, it did bring the group’s net position to a high of $520.4 million today , giving investors another sign of confidence in the future , one that might be filled with one of these two assumptions moving forward.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:e3d26e2e5094b:0-new-tariffs-hit-film-industry-what-it-means-for-netflix/
CEOs Are Saying These 2 Ominous Words on Earnings Calls More Than Ever — Barrons.com,1746025860000,"By Sabrina EscobarTariffs are top of mind for U.S. corporate executives, as evidenced by their comments during first-quarter earnings season, now roughly at its midpoint.The assessments of the 50 or so S&P 100 companies that had reported through Tuesday morning varied greatly, however. Some companies offered a detailed analysis of the negative impact tariffs would have, while others said they weren't yet concerned.Barron's combed through the earnings-call transcripts of these companies with the assistance of AlphaSense, and found a 132% increase in mention of ""tariffs"" in the past 90 days compared with the previous quarter, and a 20% increase in the word ""uncertainty,"" presumably resulting from the Trump administration's tariff policy, unveiled April 2.That lack of certainty is already creating shock waves through the economy by pausing business activity, shaking consumer confidence, and hampering companies' ability to make projections for the year ahead.""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years, so the only thing we're certain of is we don't know which, if any, of our scenarios will play out,"" said Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS, on a call with investors Tuesday. (""Uncertainty"" cropped up 22 times throughout the course of UPS' earnings call.)Here are seven other takeaways from earnings season so far:Economic MayhemInvestors were anxious to hear company commentary about how tariffs would affect the economy at large. Many executive teams obliged them, largely noting that higher levies would have a negative impact on the economy. Most, however, added a caveat that the effects won't be evident until the tariff levels are settled.""The simple truth today is that we don't yet know where trade policy will settle, nor do we know what the actual transmission effects will be on the real economy,"" said Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, adding that the consensus among economists is for softer growth this year.Goldman Sachs' expectation for growth in the U.S. has fallen ""meaningfully"" to 0.5% from over 2%, said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, adding that the prospect of a recession had increased.Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince had a similar message: ""The read-through of this uncertainty into both capital markets and the real economy creates elevated risks in the near- and medium-term,"" he said.All Eyes on the Consumer...Given that spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, it isn't surprising that businesses are tracking consumer activity as they make their forecasts for the year. The general gist is that consumers are hanging in there, but tariff anxiety is driving their spending.Some Americans are pulling their spending forward to try to get ahead from tariffs. Others have halted shopping altogether until they have more clarity on the tariff environment.""The consumer has been hit with a lot, and that's a lot to process. So, what we're seeing, I think, is a logical response from the consumer to pause,"" said Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten.Wealthier Americans may be an exception. American Express, which caters to higher-income consumers, said that the company isn't seeing any changes to shopping behavior.""Our card members may say they don't have any confidence in the economy, but they still continue to spend,"" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri....And BusinessesSeveral companies noted that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs is making businesses hesitant about investment decisions. That means they are delaying stocking up on inventory (or in some cases, overstocking), hiring, and dealmaking.""Everyone would like less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy, and that's what we're hearing from clients,"" Goldman Sach's Solomon said. ""They want to understand where the policy will settle out so that they can make capital decisions, investment decisions, planning decisions.""Even technology companies that derive a big chunk of their revenue from services, rather than hardware, could see a slowdown as policy settles.""In the near term, uncertainty may cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach,"" said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna. He added that the company's consulting business was also ""more susceptible"" to discretionary pullbacks and government cuts.Small and medium-size businesses could be big drivers of the pullback in spending. Many source directly from China, and while they are working with manufacturers to move to different countries, they don't have the size advantage or financial flexibility that bigger players do to diversify their supply chain, UPS's Tomé said.Creative GuidanceAll the uncertainty has made it hard for companies to make accurate projections for the year ahead, and as a result, ""S&P 500 companies have gotten creative with how they are talking about the future,"" notes Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management.PepsiCo aimed to rerate investor expectations from the get-go and lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing more volatility ahead and a subdued consumer environment. Some firms decided to do away with guidance altogether, including airlines American, Southwest, and Alaska. General Motors pulled its profit guidance for 2025, saying the prior forecast ""can't be relied upon.""Most companies, however, maintained guidance for the year. Some of these, such as science-equipment producer Danaher, said their guidance was unchanged because they believe they can completely offset the projected tariff impact. Others, like defense and aerospace giant RTX, maintained guidance but noted that tariff impacts weren't factored into their outlook for the year.3M executives reiterated its earnings guidance, but said tariffs could crimp earnings per share by anywhere from 20 cents to 40 cents a share, barring any mitigation strategies.Even in the midst of the chaos, there were still a few guidance raises. AbbVie tweaked its adjusted earnings per share guidance higher — but it doesn't reflect any shifts in trade policy, including the potential for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs.""It's premature to speculate on the impact, and once we have that information, we'll communicate at the appropriate time,"" said AbbVie CEO Robert Michael. Other healthcare also companies refrained from making sweeping guidance changes until the sector's tariffs are completed.Mitigation, Mitigation, MitigationCompanies are pursuing a host of initiatives to soften the tariff blow. The main efforts are tied to shuffling about supply chains, including diversifying countries of origin and sourcing products in the U.S.Firms are also negotiating with vendors to try to share the burden of higher import costs, and trimming costs across the business to redirect toward the import tax. Hasbro, for instance, said it was accelerating its cost-cutting program and is now aiming to save $175 million to $225 million this year.If all else fails, most will resort to an age-tested solution: raising prices.The problem — as Colgate-Palmolive CEO Noel Wallace explained — is that if consumer demand falls, companies will have less wiggle room to hike prices.""The pricing environment will continue to be challenging, I think, in terms of where things go now,"" Wallace said. ""As tariffs take hold, I think everyone will be looking for ways to create value in the category that will be principally driven, in my view, through innovation. But there will be some pricing that will have to take place in certain markets around the world.""Business-facing enterprises may have more flexibility to increase prices than consumer-facing ones.All Good HereWhile most companies were bracing investors for the havoc that accompanies higher tariffs, a lucky few indicated they weren't too concerned about the levies.Telecommunications firms, for instance, felt confident that consumers weren't going to shut down their phone lines, and that they would be able to pass on any phone price increases to the consumer.""Whenever I get asked about the economy, my first answer is we're not really the people to ask,"" said Mike Sievert, CEO at T-Mobile. ""I mean, we're probably the least canary in your coal mine because people feel so strongly about this category that we'll find a way to keep paying their bills.""Netflix's executive team struck a confident tone as well, noting that home entertainment becomes ""really important"" to households in tougher economies.Renewable energy provider NextEra Energy estimates that tariffs will affect capital spend for its energy resource segment by less than 0.2%, which could even be negotiated down to zero.""When I think about where we stand, I feel very good about tariffs. It's just not going to have much of an impact at all on our business,"" said CEO John Ketchum.We're Talking to TrumpSome companies sought to reassure investors that they were engaging with the administration to eke out the best deal for the industry.""I don't think a day goes by where we aren't engaged with someone in the administration, including cabinet secretaries and up to POTUS himself,"" said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg.""So we're spending a lot of time making sure the administration understands the implications of either short-term or long-term tariffs on not just our company, but the overall aviation industry here in the U.S.,"" he added.That said, firms are toeing a fine line between advocating for softer tariffs, and staying on the president's good side.""We have been, I think, full-throated in our support of the administration's efforts to support American competitiveness and revitalize American manufacturing. We're well-aligned in that regard,"" said GE Aerospace CEO Lawrence Culp. ""But it's easy to overlook the $75 billion trade surplus the sector enjoys largely on the back of this tariff-free regime that we've had since 1979. So, all we have suggested, as the administration works through a myriad of issues, is that they consider the position of strength that the country enjoys as a result of this tariff-free regime and to consider re-establishing the same.""Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tariff uncertainty clouds outlook for US television's annual ad-selling bonanza,1747044000000,"The risk of a tariff-induced U.S. recession is hanging over the television industry's annual upfront selling season, when companies stage star-studded pitches to coax brands to commit to spending billions of dollars on advertising in the year ahead. Starting Monday, the presentations in New York kick off weeks of negotiations in which television networks and streaming services typically lock in the largest share of their ad revenue for the year. YouTube NASDAQ:GOOG promises a performance by Lady Gaga and an appearance from one of its biggest stars, Mr. Beast. NBCUniversal will host its presentation at Radio City Music Hall and Warner Bros. Discovery NASDAQ:WBD at Madison Square Garden.But the champagne-fueled parties will take place against a backdrop of economic concerns, stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies, which economists warn may lead to a recession. While major media companies have not reported any decline in ad demand, industry analysts predict brands will reduce their spending as consumer confidence wanes.Research firm eMarketer projects ad spending on traditional television during the upfronts could fall to $13.4 billion, down $4 billion from last year, depending on the level of tariffs that take effect. The Trump administration is negotiating deals with a number of major trading partners, including China.For digital ads on online devices, the worst-case scenario is that spending will stay flat at around $13 billion, eMarketer said. If tariffs are limited, digital ads could rise to $14.7 billion.Data firm Guideline said a pullback was already evident. Ad spending rose 7% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2024, but future bookings suggest growth could decelerate to 3% in the second quarter, Guideline said. Media executives acknowledged some brands might feel nervous, but said there could be a cost to cutting ad spending.""Clients learned some important lessons during COVID, when a lot of advertisers pulled back very quickly and then had to redeploy those funds,"" said Jeff Collins, president of advertising sales, marketing and brand partnerships at Fox NASDAQ:FOX . ""And I think that they're trying not to have a knee-jerk reaction to what is happening now.""Advertisers that wait to purchase time at the last minute in the so-called ""scatter"" market sometimes pay double-digit percentage increases in rates, Collins said.Fox had not yet seen any impact on ad demand from tariffs, he added. Karen Kovacs, president of advertising sales and partnerships at NBCUniversal, said brands that continued to spend on advertising during past downturns maintained better sales and market share than others that cut back. NBCU parent Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA , in its latest earnings report, said ad revenue was roughly flat during the first three months of 2025. BUYER'S MARKETSellers of ad time may need to give concessions on pricing and cancellation terms to win business, said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes, adding tariffs would have most impact on the advertising of physical products like cars and consumer goods.Digital players like Google's YouTube or Facebook parent Meta NASDAQ:META will likely emphasize the use of artificial intelligence to help brands reach customers more efficiently, said Greg Kahn, CEO of GK Digital Ventures media advisory firm.Many U.S. companies have cut or withdrawn their annual forecasts, citing an uncertain trade environment, including General Motors NYSE:GM , Kraft Heinz NASDAQ:KHC and bleach maker Clorox NYSE:CLX .Clorox is evaluating how much it spends on advertising, CEO Linda Rendle said on an earnings call last week.""We're going to continue to invest strongly in our brands, but at what level makes the most amount of sense given the returns that we're getting,"" Rendle said. Still, some media firms remain upbeat.Disney NYSE:DIS expects annual advertising growth to surpass its previous 3% forecast, while Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX co-CEO Greg Peters said in April the company was not seeing any signs of softness in its pre-upfronts discussions.The company does not disclose ad revenue, but analysts polled by LSEG project Netflix will bring in $2.7 billion from advertising in 2025. Netflix launched its ad-supported options in November 2022 and is still in the early stages of building that business. ""That smallness probably provides us some insulation to market shifts right now,"" Peters said, adding that Netflix expects to double ad revenue this year.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3R116L:0-tariff-uncertainty-clouds-outlook-for-us-television-s-annual-ad-selling-bonanza/"
The Trade Desk vs. Magnite: Which Ad Tech Stock is the Smarter Buy?,1746025560000,"The Trade Desk, Inc. TTD and Magnite, Inc. MGNI are players in the digital advertising technology space. TTD operates a leading demand-side platform, which aids advertisers in focusing on data-driven advertising. Magnite is a supply-side platform (SSP) that helps publishers manage and sell their ad inventory across various formats like streaming, online video, display and audio. Digital advertising spend is expected to be driven by increasing mobile penetration, social media platforms, and programmatic advertising. Per a report from Grand View Research, the global digital advertising market is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030. The report further added that digital advertising will continue to be dominated by video as brands understand the effectiveness of visual storytelling.This uptrend in spending benefits both TTD and MGNI. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in digital advertising, which stock stands out?Let us delve a little deeper into the companies’ strengths and weaknesses to see which is the better stock pick.The Case for TTDTTD is benefiting from a significant increase in digital spending in key areas, such as Connected TV (CTV) and retail media. In the fourth quarter of 2024, The Trade Desk reported a record-breaking spend of more than $12 billion on its platform, signaling continued growth in advertiser demand. The Trade Desk also introduced its Ventura Operating System for CTV, designed to drive greater efficiency and transparency in CTV advertising. This operating system enables better data management, allowing TTD to enhance its targeting capabilities, which are crucial as the CTV market expands.The acquisition of Sincera, a leading digital advertising data company, will aid in enhancing its programmatic advertising platform by integrating Sincera’s actionable insights on data quality. The Trade Desk is actively simplifying its platform to be more intuitive without compromising sophistication, which should improve client onboarding and retention. At the same time, the company is aggressively integrating AI across all its operations to cater to the evolving needs of its clients amid the AI boom. While Kokai is expected to replace Solimar entirely by the end of 2025, TTD currently maintains two platforms, leading to operational difficulties. Any delays in Kokai adoption could impact performance and reduce upsell opportunities. Despite strong demand for its ad-buying platform, the company faced challenges from shifting market conditions and competitive pressures. Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions do not augur well for TTD, as these could squeeze ad budgets. The intensely competitive nature of the digital advertising industry, dominated by industry giants like Google and Amazon continues to put pressure on TTD’s market positioning.The Case for MGNIMagnite is gaining from robust growth in CTV, with contributions excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (ex-TAC) from CTV increasing 19% year over year for 2024. For the full year, it generated contribution ex-TAC of $607 million and processed ad spend of over $6 billion. The growth is being driven by increased ad spend and programmatic adoption by leading giants like Walmart, Disney, Fox, Roku, LG, Vizio, Warner, Discovery, and Paramount. On the last earnings call, MGNI highlighted Netflix ’s NFLX ad ramp as a significant business opportunity. Netflix is focused on expanding its global ad tier and corresponding ad revenues. MGNI expects Netflix to be a key programmatic partner as they boost the rollout of their ad platform in 2025. Given the momentum, MGNI expects contribution ex-TAC growth of over 10% or mid-teens (excluding political) in 2025. Strong growth in Live sports is another tailwind. Its expanded deal with Disney now includes live sports, international markets and podcasts, with Disney inventory also integrated into ClearLine. It is also bolstering its international sports business by expanding its partner base with additions of new partners like FIFA and Sky New Zealand. The addition of more generative AI-powered tools in 2025 is expected to expected to drive operational efficiencies and enable new monetization opportunities. MGNI’s SpringServe ad server and streaming SSP platform are its main catalysts. As MGNI does not resell inventory, its technology has enabled direct relationships with virtually all major streaming platforms except YouTube, allowing reach to 92 million U.S. and 75 million EMEA households. Moreover, ClearLine and SpringServe are driving MGNI’s agency marketplaces, which are used by firms like GroupM and Horizon. These marketplaces enable end-to-end solutions and more efficient media spend for these agencies. These tools are strategically important for MGNI, creating sticky relationships with agencies and advertisers. The company’s tech stack initiatives have helped it reduce costs per ad request in 2024. For DV+, the costs per ad have reduced by 26%, and for CTV, it has come down by 45%. However, as with all firms operating in this space, competitive pressure, especially from tech behemoths, is enormous, along with macroeconomic uncertainty that could threaten ad budgets. Also, MGNI’s DV+ (display, video, and mobile) business underperformed in the fourth quarter of 2024, mainly due to a post-election unusual spending patterns. Though MGNI added that the business has rebounded across verticals, the volatility can be a concern. Also, its heavy reliance on CTV business increases business risk. Higher expenses could weigh down on profitability. Share Performance for TTD & MGNIBoth TTD and MGNI shares have suffered from tech sell-off due to the escalating trade war situation. Over the past three months, MGNI has lost 28.5% while TTD’s decline stands at a staggering 54%. Valuation for TTD & MGNIValuation-wise, TTD is overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F, while MGNI has a Value Score of B, respectively. In terms of the forward 12-month price/earnings ratio, TTD shares are trading at 28.37X, higher than MGNI’s 12.83X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for TTD & MGNI?Analysts have significantly revised their earnings estimates downward for TTD’s bottom line.While for MGNI, there is no revision. TTD or MGNI: Which is a Smarter Pick?Currently, MGNI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick compared with TTD, which has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Magnite stands out as the smarter pick due to its stronger valuation, diversified partnerships, and expanding CTV footprint with clients like Netflix and Disney. If investors are seeking an AI tech stock with long-term growth potential, MGNI is a better pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:95bc78dd4094b:0-the-trade-desk-vs-magnite-which-ad-tech-stock-is-the-smarter-buy/
Netflix Wins Praise From Top Analyst for AI-Powered TV Interface Overhaul,1746813995000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX drew investor attention Friday after a well-known analyst backed the streaming platform's redesign of its TV interface, calling it a potential driver of stronger engagement and revenue.The platform's upgraded TV app now offers real-time, personalized recommendations based on a user's viewing and search habits. BMO Capital's five-star analyst Brian Pitz reaffirmed a ""Buy"" rating on the stock, highlighting how these updates could improve viewer retention, increase content discovery, and help drive advertising revenue.Pitz also pointed to Netflix's use of AI across both TV and mobile to enhance content suggestions. He said the more interactive format could support a broader user base and deepen customer stickiness.Addressing potential pressure from Trump-era tariffs on foreign-made content, Pitz said Netflix's diversified library and production footprint, spanning over 50 countries, could reduce exposure to those trade risks.In its most recent quarter, Netflix reported strong revenue growth, with Asia-Pacific up 23% year over year and EMEA rising 15%. Cost discipline also supported margins, with marketing expenses falling to $688 million from $976 million in the prior quarter.Shares of Netflix were down slightly in afternoon trading.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8367f4ebc094b:0-netflix-wins-praise-from-top-analyst-for-ai-powered-tv-interface-overhaul/
Buy 5 Stocks That Have Survived April's Tariff-Led Market Mayhem,1745928720000,"Wall Street has seen severe volatility in April owing to the imposition of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade-related policies. With just two days of trading left, most of the major stock indexes are trading in negative territory month to date. A large section of economists and financial researchers have warned of a near-term recession too. Trade-related negotiations are ongoing between the Trump administration and several other important nations. Stock prices of a long list of corporate behemoths have tumbled in April. Although we are not out of the woods so far, a sliver line is visible.A handful of corporate bigwigs (market capital > $50 billion) have survived April’s Wall Street turmoil. Stock prices of these companies have provided positive returns (> 5%) month to date. We recommend five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.These are: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Newmont Corp. NEM, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. AEM and Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last seven days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Netflix Inc.Netflix handsomely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for bottom line while the top line was mostly in line with the consensus mark in first-quarter 2025. Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels. NFLX reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.The primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Netflix’s policies of offering ad-supported lower-prices tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 27.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.8% over the last seven days. Newmont Corp.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. NEM is likely to gain from several projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest also created an industry-leading portfolio and provided opportunities for significant synergies. NEM also remains focused on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders.Newmont has received full funds approval for its Ahafo North project and the project has reached the execution stage. Commercial production for the project is expected to commence in second-half 2025. NEM remains committed to Ghana, investing $950 million to $1,050 million in development capital for Ahafo North. Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.9% and 16.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last seven days. Philip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris has benefited from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio. PM has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, PM aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.Philip Morris is set for another year of robust growth in 2025, driven by increasing demand across all product categories. PM anticipates positive volume growth for the fifth consecutive year, with an expected increase of 2%. Smoke-free products remain a key growth driver, projected to expand by 12-14%, reinforcing PM’s strategic shift toward reduced-risk alternatives.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last seven days. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd.Agnico Eagle Mines is focused on executing projects that are expected to provide additional production growth. The Kittila expansion promises cost savings, while acquisitions like Hope Bay and the merger with Kirkland Lake Gold strengthen its market position. Merger with Kirkland Lake Gold established the new AEM as the industry's highest-quality senior gold producer. Higher gold prices are also expected to drive AEM’s margins. AEM’s strategic diversification mitigates risks, supported by prudent debt management and maintaining financial flexibility.Agnico Eagle Mines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.9% and 33.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.8% over the last seven days. Spotify Technology Spotify Technology provides audio streaming services worldwide.

Disney Stock Soars After Earnings. Why It's All About Abu Dhabi and Theme Parks. — Barrons.com,1746643560000,"By George Glover and Angela PalumboDisney stock was soaring Wednesday after the company beat Wall Street's earnings target and unveiled a plan to build a theme park in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.The House of Mouse reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.45 a share and revenue rose 7% from a year ago to $23.6 billion. Analysts expected an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.1 billion, according to a FactSet poll.In afternoon trading, shares jumped 9.7% to $101.15. The stock was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.2%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.Revenue for Disney's experiences segment, which includes its theme parks, rose 6% from a year ago to $8.9 billion. The Street was looking for $8.7 billion. The solid parks revenue growth could help to reassure investors, who had been fretting that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive up inflation and lead to Americans spending less on big-ticket items like vacations.Shortly after it posted earnings, the company announced it would build a park on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. It would be the company's seventh park and first in the Middle East.""This groundbreaking resort destination represents a new frontier in theme park development,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the company's experiences division, said in a statement. ""Our resort in Abu Dhabi will be the most advanced and interactive destination in our portfolio.""The theme park, according to Disney's 10-Q filing, will be built and operated by Miral, a limited liability corporation in the UAE.Disney will license its intellectual property to Miral and will earn royalties based on the project's revenue. Disney didn't rdisclose a launch date or size of the theme park, according to the 10-Q filing.Miral, according to Disney, has developed several family destinations on Yas Island with American and European brands.""It is all their capital and we will get a royalty. So there isn't ownership. We own our IP and license it to them as essentially the arrangement,"" Disney management said on the earnings call.Disney runs its Japanese theme parks similarly. According to the company's most recent annual 10-K filing, Disney earns royalties on revenues generated by the Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land, a third-party Japanese corporation.Disney's streaming division, which includes the Disney+ platform, added 2.5 million subscribers over the quarter ended March 31. Its operating profit rose to $336 million, up from $47 million a year earlier.Disney said it was expecting adjusted earnings of $5.75 a share for its current fiscal year, which ends in September, although it noted that it will be monitoring macroeconomic developments that could shift its outlook. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of $5.43 for the current fiscal year.The earnings beat ought to give the stock a much-needed boost.

Netflix's Ted Sarandos Says Cinemas Are Fading as Viewers Stay Home,1745869671000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) co-CEO Ted Sarandos said traditional moviegoing is falling out of favor as more people choose to watch films at home. Speaking at the 2025 TIME100 Summit in New York, Sarandos said Netflix is saving Hollywood by keeping audiences engaged with new content that might otherwise disappear.Sarandos said falling box office numbers show that consumers want flexibility, and Netflix meets that demand by letting people watch when and where they want. While he acknowledged some still enjoy the communal cinema experience, he called it an outmoded idea for most.He credited Netflix with making audiences more open to different genres, pointing to a recent event where a live chamber music performance celebrated the streaming hit Bridgerton .Sarandos also said the entertainment industry often gets sidelined in global trade deals, where companies like Netflix face stricter rules than other sectors. He argued entertainment should be treated like any other serious business.He warned that U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump, particularly tariffs, could shrink the international reach of American films and shows.

Disney's Tariff Resilience Is a Surprise - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1746633600000,"By Dan GallagherThe Magic Kingdom hasn't lost its charm-even amid a trade war.Disney's share price jumped Wednesday morning after the entertainment giant posted surprisingly strong quarterly results. These included better-than-expected growth for its U.S. theme parks division, its biggest profit driver. Domestic parks operating income of $1.8 billion was 10% ahead of expectations, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.Investors had worried about Disney's exposure to the wide swath of tariffs unveiled by President Trump last month. Among other concerns, the announcements sparked fears of a sharp downtick in leisure travel, especially for visitors to the U.S. Trump's threat earlier this week to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. didn't help matters.Prior to Wednesday's report, Disney's share price was down nearly 6% from Trump's tariff unveiling on April 2, versus a 22% surge by Hollywood rival Netflix. Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino said Disney was ""priced like the sky is falling"" in an April 21 report.Wednesday report offered reassurance. Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said bookings for Disney World in Florida were up on the year for the quarters ending in June and September.Disney's Experiences business is also a global one, not just dependent on U.S. tourism.

"Roku Gears Up to Report Q1 Earnings: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745850840000,"Roku ROKU is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 1.For the first quarter of 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $1.005 billion, indicating an increase of 14% year over year. The company anticipates Platform revenues to grow 16% year over year, and Devices revenues are expected to remain flat year over year due to elevated inventory from lower holiday sales. It expects first-quarter total gross profit of $450 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13.96%. The consensus mark for loss is pinned at 20 cents per share. The estimate indicates a year-over-year growth of 42.86%.See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.ROKU Estimate MovementROKU Earnings Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 45.45%.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Shaping Upcoming Results of RokuAs Roku prepares to report first-quarter 2025 earnings, investors should maintain a cautious stance. Despite strong Platform momentum in 2024, Devices revenues and gross profit were impacted by increased seasonal discounting across the industry, including at Roku. This resulted in an excess inventory position at the end of 2024, which is expected to have weighed slightly on gross margins in the first quarter of 2025.Platform growth remains healthy, with management estimating 16% year-over-year growth for the first quarter of 2025. Streaming services distribution and advertising activities both contributed to the expected increase, with advertising activities anticipated to grow faster than subscription revenues. However, the absence of political advertising spend compared to the fourth quarter, along with seasonal trends, might have tempered advertising momentum in the quarter under review.The Roku Channel continues to expand rapidly, reaching approximately 145 million people in the United States and delivering 82% year-over-year growth in Streaming Hours during the fourth quarter. Enhancements to the Roku Experience, including an AI-powered content row and expanded ad formats, such as Brand Showcases and Action Ads, are driving increased engagement and monetization. Nevertheless, macroeconomic uncertainty and competitive shifts in the ad market may present near-term volatility.Roku operates in an increasingly competitive advertising landscape, facing new pressures in the first quarter of 2025 as companies like Netflix NFLX, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, and Disney DIS expand their ad-supported streaming offerings. The global reach, brand strength, and established advertiser relationships of these companies may have challenged Roku’s ability to capture ad budgets and sustain advertising momentum during the quarter under review.Roku’s international expansion into markets like Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom is expected to have driven user growth in the first quarter of 2025. However, as the company remains focused on scaling its international presence before prioritizing monetization, the immediate impact on revenues is expected to have been limited.Top-Line Growth Estimates for Q1The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average revenue per user is pegged at $42.09. The consensus mark for first-quarter 2025 Devices revenues is pegged at $127 million, and for Platform revenues, it is pinned at $877 million.ROKU Price Performance & Stock ValuationShares of Roku have lost 11.6% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 index’s decline of 4.9% and 6.4%, respectively.ROKU’s YTD Price PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, Roku currently trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 43.86X, which is at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 31.54X. While this valuation gap suggests that investors have high growth expectations for this stock, it is not a good pick for a value investor. A value score of D further reinforces an unattractive valuation for ROKU at this moment. Price-to-Cash Flow RatioInvestment ConsiderationsRoku continues to demonstrate strong platform fundamentals with robust user engagement, innovative Home Screen monetization, and healthy international expansion. However, investors should adopt a cautious stance ahead of first-quarter 2025 results. Elevated inventory levels and margin pressures from seasonal discounting in Devices, combined with intensifying competition in ad-supported streaming, may weigh on near-term performance. While Platform revenues are poised for double-digit growth and advertising activities remain a key strength, given Roku’s premium valuations and potential volatility in advertising trends, patience could reward investors seeking a more attractive entry point.ConclusionRoku’s platform growth trajectory remains healthy, but current valuations largely reflect its projected growth. With first-quarter gross margins pressured by excess holiday inventory, seasonal advertising trends normalizing, and competitive intensity rising in ad-supported streaming, investors should consider maintaining existing positions while awaiting a more favorable entry point. The company's innovations in Home Screen monetization and international expansion offer long-term upside, but prudent investors may benefit from patience ahead of first-quarter results.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6e3d95f2e094b:0-roku-gears-up-to-report-q1-earnings-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock/

Tech Sizzled Last Week: Top-Performing ETFs in the Sector,1745841600000,"Wall Street was charged-up last week, thanks to the tech rally . The major averages rose last week, recording their second positive week out of three. The S&P 500 gained 4.6%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, the Nasdaq jumped 6.7% and the Russell 2000 advanced 4.1% last week (as of April 25, 2025).Despite this week's rally, April has been mixed overall. The Nasdaq is now slightly positive for the month, but the S&P 500 remains down 1.5% month to date, and the Dow has fallen 4.5%.Tech Giants Lead the RallyBig tech stocks were a major catalyst on April 25. Alphabet GOOGL gained 1.7% after the Google parent reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on both revenues and profits. Tesla TSLA surged 9.8%, while NVIDIA NVDA and Meta Platforms META also posted strong advances of 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively.Tesla shares jumped on April 25, extending their recent rally after CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more of his time focusing on Tesla, as the Trump administration is on its way to loosening rules around self-driving cars.The latest administrative move would favor Tesla, which has long promoted autonomous vehicles as key to its growth strategy. Tesla now expects to be selling fully autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, in June, with that business expanding to other cities this year and becoming financially material in the second half of 2026. For the week, Tesla surged 23.8%, Netflix NFLX jumped 11.9%, Amazon AMZN gained 11.6%, Apple AAPL added 8.4%, Microsoft MSFT advanced 8%, Meta surged 11.5%, and NVIDIA leaped 12.5%.Semiconductor stocks staged a massive surge last week as the space had been beaten down heavily. After Trump’s announcement of tariffs, chip biggies sank massively. Now, the cues of easing trade tensions have given the space a special edge at the time of revival.Future Outlook: MixedMeanwhile, market volatility has remained elevated. Uncertainty surrounds U.S.-China trade talks after China said on April 24 that there were no negotiations underway, following earlier U.S. signals suggesting a possible softening in stance.Despite the uncertainty around tariffs and trade, Citi analysts are growing more optimistic about the market's trajectory, the CNBC article noted. Citi believes that as long as the momentum in trade negotiations remains positive and monetary policy becomes more supportive , equities should continue to stabilize and grind higher in the coming months. Possible trade de-escalation and easy money are great for tech stocks.Top-Performing Technology ETFs in Focus Against this backdrop, below we highlight some winning tech-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of the last week.Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF TESL – Up 23.7%SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF XSD – Up 15.2%iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX – Up 13.2%First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund QTEC – Up 11.3%iShares US Technology ETF IYW – Up 10.2%First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN – Up 9.4%Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Tech ETF PSCT – Up 9.2%This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d019289dc094b:0-tech-sizzled-last-week-top-performing-etfs-in-the-sector/
Amazon to spend $4 billion on cloud infrastructure in Chile,1746623400000,"Amazon's cloud computing division will invest $4 billion to build its first data centers and other cloud infrastructure in Chile, the company's head of South Latin America told Reuters.Amazon Web Services (AWS) expects the cloud region, its third in Latin America after Brazil and Mexico, to be operational by the second half of 2026.In an interview in Santiago on Tuesday, local head of AWS Juan Pablo Estevez said all the necessary permits had been given for the project, which would deliver ""substantial"" computing power for services like generative AI.The surge of data centers globally has caused concerns over energy and water use, which have been amplified in Chile as the country has suffered a drought for more than 15 years.Environmental concerns forced Google to rework plans for a $200 million data center in Chile after a local environmental court partially reversed its permit last September.Microsoft expects its cloud-computing Azure center in Chile to come online this year, according to its website. Estevez said Amazon's cloud region would use water to cool its servers just 4% of the year, the equivalent of about eight homes over a 15-year period, with air and evaporation technology used the rest of the time.He added that Amazon has been matching 100% of its energy consumption with renewable power since 2023.The company already has 36 regions and 114 availability zones worldwide used by companies such as Netflix, General Electric and Sony for storage, networking and remote security.Chilean retailer Cencosud, online retail giant MercadoLibre, and mining companies already use the company's other regional services, it said.Amazon's first-quarter cloud revenue and income forecast came in below estimates last Thursday, but Estevez said he's expecting strong growth in Chile and across the region.""The forecast is that the (Chile's) market will grow 20.3% year over year from now until 2028,"" he said, adding that the market was $1.5 billion last year and estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2025.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RE0UJ:0-amazon-to-spend-4-billion-on-cloud-infrastructure-in-chile/"

"Tech Executives Are Starting to Talk Tariffs. What It May Mean for Apple, Amazon Earnings — Barrons.com",1745691240000,"By Angela PalumboTechnology companies are starting to talk about how Donald Trump's trade war may impact their business. We'll find out more as earnings keep coming next week, with tariffs top of mind.Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Apple, and Spotify are scheduled to report in the coming days. Investors will be listening closely to hear how the trade war may be disrupting supply chains and products shipped from China and other countries facing Trump's tariffs.Some tech companies have already discussed tariffs on earnings calls. But the situation is fluid with exemptions in place for some types of chips, hardware, and iPhones. Trump recently said that 145% on tariffs on Chinese goods would drop ""substantially,"" but the timing is unclear and companies face near-term disruptions in sales.Here's what some tech companies have said, providing a glimpse of what's to come.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet""We're obviously not immune to the macro environment. But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers.""Alphabet didn't mention tariffs on its earnings call Thursday, except indirectly in this quote from Pichai. The de minimis exemption had allowed lower cost packages to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but Trump ended that exemption. Alphabet could be hit if Chinese e-commerce firms like Shein and Temu pull back on ad spending.Meta (parent of Instagram and Facebook) and Amazon are in a similar boat: both generate considerable revenue from advertising. Amazon relies heavily on Chinese suppliers and retailers for its marketplace revenue, and Trump's tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods are certain to sting, along with higher duties on imports from other countries.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla""Tariffs are tough on a company when margins are still low.""Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Musk made it clear that despite his close relationship with the president, he's an advocate for ""free trade and lower tariffs."" A 25% tariff on imported cars and a 25% parts tariff are set to be implemented by early May.More notable is what Tesla didn't say: The company declined to update guidance for the rest of 2025, citing uncertainty around the impact of trade policy on the auto and energy supply chains.Tesla has far more protection from tariffs than other auto makers due to its large manufacturing base in North America; 85% of its vehicles comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to Benchmark Equity Research. Tesla stock is showing signs of life, rising 10% Friday on hopes for new products and the launch of robo-taxis in June.David Zinsner, CFO of Intel""We believe Q1 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior in anticipation of potential tariffs, though it is difficult to quantify the magnitude.""Intel reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Thursday, but gave disappointing second-quarter revenue guidance. Tariffs are causing uncertainty for the company and its customers, even as the Trump administration has put temporary exemptions on some tech products, like laptops. It seems that shoppers have started to take action to get ahead of potentially rising prices; that could bode poorly for the future.One read-through is that Apple may also top estimates, benefiting from accelerated sales of iPhones. Several Wall Street analysts have said they expect the iPhone maker could report better-than-expected revenue due to accelerated demand. The drawback: fewer phone upgrades in the months ahead.William McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow"" Yes, CEOs are mindful that the global economy is in a fluid state. No, they are not standing still.""ServiceNow is an enterprise software company that not only reported better-than-expected first-quarter financials on Wednesday, but also provided stronger-than-expected subscription revenue guidance.ServiceNow offers software solutions to businesses, including those powered by generative artificial intelligence. Companies have been willing to spend big on these software products to boost productivity. There's been worry on Wall Street that enterprises will start to cut back their IT budgets to get ahead of a potential economic slowdown. ServiceNow says that hasn't happened yet.Microsoft, which reports earnings on Wednesday, has a large software business through its Office family of apps. ServiceNow's confidence in the near-term could be a good sign for that part of Microsoft's business.Gregory Peters, Co-CEO of Netflix"" We're paying close attention, clearly, to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving. But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.""Netflix was one of the first tech companies to report its financial results this earnings season. Shares of the streamer have been outperforming the market this year and the company issued a strong outlook.Entertainment isn't directly hit by tariffs, but a slowdown in consumer spending might trickle down: consumers may downgrade to lower-priced plans or cancel service, and Netflix has a growing ad business that could weaken. Netflix asserted on April 17 that it's still in a solid position.For now, it looks like consumers still want to spend on entertainment, which could bode well for other subscription based media platforms, like Spotify Technology. The music streamer is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

S&P 500 Climbs Weekly as Tech Sector Leads Amid Positive Earnings,1745613626000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4.6% this week, led by technology stocks amid better-than-expected earnings from a number of companies in the sector including Google parent Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG . The S&P 500 ended Friday's session at 5,525.21. The index is still down 1.5% for the month and 6.1% this year on concerns about the economic impacts of the ongoing trade war between the US and several countries including China. Both Chinese officials and US President Donald Trump, however, softened their tone this week. US consumer sentiment waned for the fourth straight month in April as uncertainty around tariffs dampened expectations and pushed the year-ahead inflation outlook to the highest point since 1981, final results from the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed Friday. While the April reading of 52.2 was down from 57 in March, it was still above the consensus view for 50.5 in a poll compiled by Bloomberg. On the earnings front, Alphabet was in the spotlight as the Google parent not only released better-than-expected Q1 results but also said its board raised its quarterly dividend by 5% and authorized the repurchase of up to another $70 billion in class A and C shares. The company's shares rose by about 7% on the week. The technology sector had the largest percentage increase this week, climbing 7.9%, followed by a 7.4% gain in consumer discretionary and a 6.4% rise in communication services. Financials and industrials rose by about 3% each while materials added 2%. ServiceNow NYSE:NOW had the largest weekly percentage gain in the technology sector, jumping 22% as the company posted Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue above analysts' mean estimates. The company also forecast Q2 subscription revenue above the Street view at the time. In consumer discretionary, Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA shares climbed 18%. The electric vehicle maker's Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue both came in below Street views, but Chief Executive Elon Musk said he will recommit more of his time to the company. That was the ""biggest"" and ""best possible"" news investors could have heard, Wedbush analysts said in a note to clients. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX was the top performer in communication services, rising 13% as the company's Q1 results and Q2 guidance both exceeded analysts' expectations. Consumer staples was the lone sector in the red for the week, dropping 1.4%. Kimberly-Clark NYSE:KMB had the largest percentage drop in consumer staples, falling 7.8%. The company reported Q1 adjusted earnings above the Street view but its revenue slightly missed analysts' mean estimate. Also, Kimberly-Clark reduced its guidance for 2025 adjusted earnings per share. Next week's earnings calendar features Visa (V), Coca-Cola (KO), Pfizer (PFE), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Mastercard (MA), McDonald's (MCD), Berkshire Hathaway NYSE:BRK.A , Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

Netflix Soars to All-Time High: 5 ETFs to Ride the Surge,1745596620000,"Netflix NFLX has reached a historic milestone, with its stock price soaring to an all-time high of nearly $1,101. This surge reflects the company’s robust performance and investor confidence in its growth trajectory, solidifying its position as a leader in the streaming industry. The solid trend is likely to continue given the company’s trillion-dollar ambition and analysts’ increasing target price.Investors seeking to tap the bullish trend should invest in ETFs with the largest allocation to this streaming giant. These are First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN, FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF FDND, MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF GGME, and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC.What’s Driving Netflix Higher?Robust Q1 EarningsThe world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue estimates. The company reported earnings per share of $6.61, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69 and the year-ago earnings of $5.29. Revenues rose 13% year over year to $10.54 billion but were slightly below the consensus estimate of $10.55 billion. Netflix offered an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter. It expects revenues to grow 15% year over year to $11.04 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 44% to $7.03. The guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.96 billion for revenues and $6.22 for earnings per share at the time of issuing the guidance (read: ETFs to Tap Netflix's Q1 Earnings Beat, Solid Growth Outlook).The company launched its in-house ad tech platform on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenue growth to double in 2025, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment. Netflix reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion. Trillion-Dollar StrategyNetflix aims to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by the end of the decade, a significant leap from its current valuation of approximately $466.8 billion. The company plans to double its annual revenues from $39 billion to $80 billion, fueled by its burgeoning ad-supported subscription model and international market expansion. Netflix also forecasts its global advertising revenues to grow to $9 billion by 2030.Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division and building its advertising business. With total subscribers of more than 300 million, the company aims to increase this subscriber base to approximately 410 million by 2030 by focusing on international markets, such as India and Brazil, for much of this expansion.Defensive PlayNetflix has been viewed as a safe haven amid economic uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Its low-cost advertising-supported service plan should give it more resilience if the macroeconomic climate worsens, as tariffs will not directly impact TV shows and films (read: Inside Trump Tariffs and Their Impact on Sector ETFs). Analysts Lift Target PriceMost of the analysts raised the target price on Netflix this week, signaling bullish trends. Analysts from Morgan Stanley and Wedbush raised their price targets to $1,200 from $1,150, while Piper Sandler increased its target by $50 to $1,150. KeyBanc, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank also lifted their targets to $1,070, $1,000, $1,150 and $900, respectively, from the previous levels of $1,000, $955, $1,025 and $875.Following the earnings announcement, Guggenheim raised the target price from $1,100 to $1,150 while BMO Capital increased its target price to $1,200, highlighting the “multi-year durable ad growth opportunity” ahead. MoffettNathanson, Oppenheimer and Pivotal Research raised the price target to $1,150, $1,200 and $1,350, respectively, from $1,100, $1,150 and $1,250.Even cautious analysts like Barclays lifted the target price on Netflix to $1,000, noting that the streaming giant has become a “defensive long” investment in the current economic environment.ETFs in FocusFirst Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) : Netflix occupies the top spot at 10.6%. FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF (FDND): Netflix occupies the top position at 10.7% share.MicroSectors FANG+ ETN (FNGS): Netflix accounts for nearly 10% share in the basket.Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (GGME): Netflix is the top firm, accounting for 9.6% of the GGME assets.Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC): Netflix takes the third position at 7.5% share.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:8bd3b8a22094b:0-netflix-soars-to-all-time-high-5-etfs-to-ride-the-surge/
Trump's movie tariff threat alarms India's film makers,1746605200000,"India's film industry, which earns roughly 40% of its overseas revenue from the United States, sounded the alarm this week about higher costs after President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of 100% on all movies produced beyond American soil.Film makers, producers and distributors in one of the world's largest film industries by output struggled to weigh the likely impact of such a tariff as Trump provided scant details, stirring more questions than answers.""The real question is how the term 'foreign produced' will be defined, and until that's clear, it's hard to say anything,"" said film maker Anubhav Sinha, known for his Netflix streaming series, ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"". ""It's not yet clear whether services like post-production will be affected.""India's film industry employs 272,000 people, with overseas box office takings of about 20 billion rupees ($237 million) in fiscal 2024, or a tenth of total earnings, Deloitte and studio grouping the Motion Picture Association said in a report.Key Hollywood films with India scenes are Oscar-winners such as the rags-to-riches tale ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and the Osama bin Laden manhunt thriller, ""Zero Dark Thirty"", along with rom-com ""Eat, Pray Love"", and Batman outing ""The Dark Knight Rises"". In the absence of details on the planned levy, film producers worry it could double the cost of exporting their films to the United States, where people of Indian descent are estimated to number 5.2 million.""The United States is one of the most important overseas markets for Indian cinema, largely due to the substantial diaspora,"" said producer Madhu Bhojwani, reponsible for hits such as ""Airlift"", on workers evacuated from Kuwait during the Gulf War. ""Any increase in ticket prices resulting from these tariffs would directly affect audience turnout, compounding the challenges posed by evolving consumer behaviour and broader industry headwinds.""The cost-effective South Asian nation has also grown in stature as Hollywood's preferred hub for on-ground production and post-production services, especially in visual effects, since it offers a skilled talent pool.""Almost 10 to 15 (foreign) movies are shot in India every year, and our movie industry will be impacted very badly,"" said film trade analyst Komal Nahta. LIKELY HIT TO REVENUEProminent Indian actor and producer Prakash Raj called Trump's move ""tariff terrorism"".If the tariff covers post-production services, the consequences will be bigger, added Bhojwani, the co-founder of Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures.""We can expect a potential decline in outsourced work from U.S. studios to Indian vendors, which could have notable implications for the Indian media services sector,"" she said. ""If revenue from the U.S. drops, it could affect budget planning and profitability for Indian production houses,"" said Pradeep Dwivedi, chief executive of Eros International Media NSE:EROSMEDIA .""Big-budget films counting on overseas revenue could be restructured or scaled back.""The move will also hurt smaller releases in the United States.""Even a 30% drop in revenue for such mid-scale movies would be a significant dent,"" said Raj Kandukuri, producer of a well-regarded film, ""Pelli Choopulu"", in India's southern language of Telugu. ""There are a sizeable number of students in the United States who watch movies, they will not spend high on ticket prices.""The planned levy might also drive a broader shift to digital platforms.""U.S. distributors might be less inclined to pick up Indian titles due to the increased cost,"" Dwivedi said.""This could result in fewer screens, smaller releases, and a shift toward digital platforms instead of theatrical. The tariff would likely accelerate a move toward direct-to-digital releases on platforms like ErosNow, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.""

ETFs in Focus ",1745582400000,"Shares of the Magnificent Seven (Mag 7) — NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla TSLA — are under pressure this year, as trade tensions, AI disruption and demand swings shake confidence (read: 5 Resilient Tech ETFs Over the Past Month Amid Worsening Outlook).Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS has lost 16.7% so far this year (as of April 24, 2025). Among the seven players, Tesla Inc TSLA shares are the most beaten-down, plunging 31.6% as of the same date.Meanwhile, Netflix Inc. NFLX shares have advanced 23.7% this year. Netflix reported strong first-quarter 2025 results after the closing bell on April 17. The world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed on revenues.Inside the Bullish Outlook of Netflix Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Netflix offers an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter and several analysts raised the target price on the stock, signaling bullish trends. Nine out of 11 analysts upped their earnings estimates for the upcoming quarter over the past seven days, while none cut estimates. Netflix’s earnings estimate for the June quarter stands at $7.05 per share, up from $6.22 recorded seven days ago.What’s Happening to Tesla?Zacks Rank # 4 (Sell) Tesla TSLA reported dismal first-quarter 2025 results this week, missing estimates for earnings and revenues. However, shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% in after-market hours (after reporting the earnings results) after CEO Elon Musk injected optimism by reaffirming the company’s goals for the launch of robotaxis and affordable vehicles. Musk’s promise to refocus on his business rekindled investor hopes.There has been no movement in earnings estimates for Tesla over the past seven days. However, seven out of 10 analysts cut their estimates over the past 30 days for the earnings of the upcoming quarter. Zacks Consensus Earnings estimate for Tesla for the June quarter stands at 57 cents, down from 63 cents over the past one-month period.Could Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?As Tesla’s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix is emerging as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow, and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock is in the green, defying the Mag-7 candidates.Netflix is known for its free cash flow strength. It reported $2.661 billion free cash flow (FCF) in Q1, up 24.5% year over year and 93% from the prior quarter. Moreover, its FCF margin shot up to 25.2% from 15% in Q4, implying NFLX stock could be worth much more. Netflix's revenue grew by just 12.5% year over year, but free cash flow (FCF) jumped 24.5% — from $2.137 billion to $2.661 billion — nearly twice as fast. This highlights strong operating leverage in action: as revenue increases, profitability scales even more rapidly.Valuation Comparison: Tesla Vs. NetflixTesla trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 99.34X (even after this year’s crash) compared with the past median value of 125.01X. Tesla’s P/FCF ratio stands at 254.66 times.In comparison, Netflix trades at a forward P/E of 44.77X (even after this year’s rally), much lower than the 10-year median value of 76.96X. Netflix’s P/FCF ratio stands at 69.24 times. This clearly explains that Netflix is undervalued.Netflix-Heavy ETFs in FocusInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too. Netflix-heavy ETFs include single-stock funds like  T-Rex 2X Long NFLX Daily Target ETF  NFLU and  Direxion Daily NFLX Bull 2X Shares  NFXL.Some other Netflix-heavy ETFs are  MicroSectors FANG+ ETN  (FNGS) (Netflix has a 9.18% weight),  Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF  GGME (NFLX stock has an 8.80% weight) and  First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund  FDN (NFLX shares have a 9.19% weight).This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:56c89f25c094b:0-should-netflix-be-one-of-the-mag-7-replacing-tesla-etfs-in-focus/
Can Netflix Run Continue Despite Tariff Threat?,1746566580000,"The latest tariff news over the weekend had to do with the movie industry. President Trump authorized the Department of Commerce and the USTR to immediately begin the process of instituting 100% tariff on any and all foreign movies coming into the US. While many wondered how exactly that would look given the state of streaming nowadays, it still made a negative impact on Netflix ( NFLX ) Monday morning.The stock gapped down to open the day at $1,114.80, getting as low as $1,107.01. The stock was bid most of the day, closing $10 off its high for the day at $1,134.06. Netflix has been on a tear lately after testing its 200-day, dipping to $821.10 on Monday, April 7th before finding a bid. Earnings helped it along as well.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Netflix’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:354e85034094b:0-can-netflix-run-continue-despite-tariff-threat/

Netflix Stock Has Been a 'Tariff Safe Haven.' That's About to Change. — Barrons.com,1746551340000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix stock has been a solid outperformer this year, but concerns about film tariffs have given investors pause.President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a research note on Tuesday that Netflix ""has been viewed by investors as a 'safe haven' with respect to tariffs.""That safe haven is at risk now following Trump's announcement, and Bazinet wrote the worst case scenario for Netflix would be if the 100% tariff on content produced outside of the U.S. was implemented.""We estimate 50% of content produced by Netflix is created outside the US,"" Bazinet wrote. ""With a 100% tariff, we estimate this could reduce EPS by around $6 per share.""Bazinet, who rates Netflix as Neutral with $1,020 price target, wrote that he believes Netflix will do all it can to mitigate the tariff impacts, which could include shifting production to the U.S., restricting U.S. access to content produced outside the country, and raising prices.There's still a lot of uncertainty around what these tariffs will actually look like.Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok wrote on Tuesday the impact to entertainment companies ""is subject to a vast number of variable terms, including the decision to actually implement the tariff or not, the timing of implementation, and any potential exceptions negotiated by companies or countries.""Netflix declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment Tuesday.Although stocks have taken a hit over tariff worries, Netflix shares have gained 28% this year, compared with the 4.4% decline in the S&P 500.Shares dropped 1.9% on Monday, however, which was the stock's first day closing in the red since April 16.

Disney Stock Is Struggling. Why Theme-Park Earnings Will Be Key for Any Rebound. — Barrons.com,1746530340000,"By George GloverEarnings from The Walt Disney Co. will give investors a sense of how the entertainment company's most profitable business is holding up, amid worries that President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause U.S. consumer spending to plummet.Disney is set to post its results for the March quarter ahead of the opening bell. It's expected to report an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.09 billion, according to a FactSet poll. A year ago, it reported a profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $21.8 billion.Shares could do with a boost: They have plunged 17% this year, compared with a 3.9% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock is lagging behind rivals Netflix and NBCUniversal parent Comcast, which are up 27% and down 8.2%, respectively, in 2025.Investors see Disney as more exposed to tariffs than its peers. That is because the company made about 60% of its profit over the last fiscal year from its experiences business, which includes theme parks. If the levies drive up inflation, consumers could start spending less on big-ticket items such as vacations, which would weigh on the House of Mouse's top and bottom lines.Analysts are predicting revenue for the experiences segment will have climbed 3.9% from a year ago to $8.7 billion. If that number comes in higher-than-expected, expect Disney shares to rally.Investors will also be hoping for another quarter of growth for Disney's streaming business, which turned its first-ever profit in 2024. They could also zero in on revenue for the company's studios segment, which is reeling from a failed live-action Snow White remake . The film cost nearly $300 million to produce, but flopped amid a backlash about its casting and use of CGI ""dwarfs.""Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Roku Introduces New Device Line-Up: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745510820000,"Roku ROKU has unveiled new streaming devices and software updates, improving the “Roku Experience” for more than 90 million households. Innovations include personalized content discovery, a new “Coming Soon to Theaters” row, and streamlined sports highlights, making TV more tailored to each viewer.The company also introduced its most compact streaming sticks, upgraded Roku-made TVs, and expanded into smart home tech with battery-powered indoor and outdoor cameras. Roku’s Smart Home OS and new Smart Projector design aim to increase user engagement. These innovations are part of Roku’s broader strategy to make streaming simpler, more connected, and more enjoyable, while continuing to grow its presence in the global home entertainment and smart device markets.Why ROKU’s New Launches Deserve AttentionRoku’s device segment faced significant challenges in the fourth quarter of 2024, as weak holiday demand and excess inventory led to aggressive discounting, pressuring profit margins. While the company anticipates a return to normal margins in 2025, near-term device profits are expected to remain flat despite potential sales growth.This makes Roku’s latest product launches especially timely. The introduction of compact streaming sticks, upgraded Roku TVs, and smart home devices is aimed at reigniting sales momentum and expanding user engagement. These innovations not only improve the overall “Roku Experience” but also help differentiate the brand in a crowded market, positioning Roku to recover from recent setbacks and continue growing its platform business.ROKU’s Financial Performance and MilestonesRoku hit a major milestone in the fourth quarter of 2024, crossing $1 billion in platform revenues for the first time, which was up 25% year over year. The company ended the year with 89.8 million global streaming households, gaining 4.3 million in the fourth quarter alone. Roku passed 90 million households in early January 2025 and aims to reach 100 million soon through continued platform growth and global expansion.User engagement also climbed, with total streaming hours rising 18% year over year to 34.1 billion in the fourth quarter and reaching 127.1 billion for 2024. The Roku Channel stood out, with an 82% surge in streaming hours, now reaching about 145 million U.S. viewers. It remains the #3 app on the platform by reach and engagement, helping drive Roku’s ad-supported revenue momentum.ROKU Offers Promising Guidance for 2025For 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $4.61 billion, indicating 12% year-over-year growth. Platform revenues are anticipated to reach $3.95 billion, suggesting an increase of 12% year over year. Excluding political ad spending, this suggests 15% growth, slightly above the 2024 rate.Roku projects an adjusted EBITDA of $350 million for 2025, indicating a 35% increase from the 2024 level. This demonstrates improving profitability as the company scales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.59 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 11.58%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pinned at 1 cent per share, which has been revised upward from a loss of 26 cents per share over the past seven days. Roku’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 55.07%See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.ROKU Faces Intense Competition in AdvertisingRoku operates in a highly competitive advertising industry and competes for revenues with other companies that have launched ad-supported streaming. Some of these companies include Netflix NFLX, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD and Disney DIS. Since its launch, Netflix’s ad-supported tier reached 70 million global monthly users as of late 2024, while Warner Bros. Discovery expanded its ad-supported tier on Max to more than 45 countries in the past 15 months. As of January this year, Disney had approximately 157 million global monthly active users watching ad-supported content across its streaming platforms. If Roku is unable to improve its own platform’s capabilities to face the increasing competition, both business and growth prospects of the company may be harmed.Stock Price Performance and Valuation of ROKUIn the year-to-date period, Roku shares have plunged 20.3%, underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 7% and the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s growth of 9.3%. Shares of its competitors Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney have lost 24.7% and 22.7%, respectively, while Netflix has gained 16.7%.ROKU’s YTD Price PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, Roku currently trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 41.78X, which is at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 30.28X. While this valuation gap suggests that investors have high growth expectations for this stock, it is not a good pick for a value investor. A value score of D further reinforces an unattractive valuation for ROKU at this moment. ROKU Is Trading at a PremiumConclusion: Hold ROKU Stock for NowDespite recent margin pressures in its device segment and fierce competition in the ad-supported streaming space, Roku’s long-term outlook remains promising. The company is making smart investments in product innovation, platform enhancements, and international expansion, all of which aim to increase user engagement and grow monetization. Its strong growth in platform revenues, rising streaming hours, and expanding user base reflect a scalable business model. However, elevated valuation levels and underperformance in the stock price suggest that near-term caution is warranted. As Roku continues improving profitability and executing on its strategy, investors should monitor its progress and consider holding the stock for now.ROKU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

These 3 Companies Crushed Earnings Season,1748013300000,"The 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly winding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has overall been positive, though commentary surrounding upcoming periods has largely dictated post-earnings moves amid elevated uncertainty stemming from tariff talks.Still, several companies – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – knocked it out of the park, posting robust results that had shareholders pleased. Let’s take a closer look at each release for those interested in near-term momentum.Netflix Shares SurgeConsistently strong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors amid the uncertain environment. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid other trends like the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has been the real highlight from Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.As shown below, Netflix’s sales growth has remained rock-solid, posting double-digit percentage YoY growth in six consecutive periods.Eaton Breaks RecordsEaton’s results were fantastic, with the company posting record Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.72 (up 13% YoY), record Q1 sales of $6.4 billion (up 7% YoY), and record segment margins of 23.9% (80 bp increase YoY). Further, organic sales growth totaled 9%, above the high end of previous guidance. ETN topped off the results by raising its organic revenue growth guidance for its current fiscal year.Backlog growth within its Electrical segment improved 6% year-over-year, whereas its Aerospace backlog also enjoyed a 16% surge from the year-ago period. The company’s top line has shown solid, consistent growth, as shown below.In addition to consistent sales growth, the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, sporting a 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. As shown in the annual chart below, ETN’s dividend growth has remained strong not just over the last five years, but over the last decade overall.Please note that the final value in the chart below is tracked on a trailing twelve-month basis, as the company’s current fiscal year hasn’t ended yet.Centene Raises OutlookAdjusted EPS of $2.90 and sales of $46.6 billion from Centene blew away our consensus estimates, with earnings up a strong 28% year-over-year. Higher than expected membership growth led the company to up its 2025 premium and service revenues guidance by $6.0 billion, which already improved by a strong 17% YoY throughout the quarter.As shown below, Centene’s sales have remained strong over recent periods, with the most recent period reflecting a notable acceleration. The company also maintained its current year EPS guidance, providing investors with a nice sense of stability in an anxious setting.Analysts adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the release and guidance upgrade, with Centene now expected to post $179.6 billion in revenues in its current fiscal year. The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bottom LineThe 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly grinding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has been positive so far, with all three companies above – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – posting robust results and either reaffirming or raising their guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:b0e15118c094b:0-these-3-companies-crushed-earnings-season/
Disney Earnings: A Closer Look,1746486960000,"Earnings season continues to move rapidly, with this week by far reflecting the busiest yet. So far, the performance has been decent, but recent tariff talks have caused analysts to downwardly revise their earnings expectations for the current (Q2) and coming periods.This week, we’ll hear from entertainment titan Disney DIS. Disney has assets that span movies, television shows, and theme parks.But how does the company shape up heading into its earnings release, particularly on the streaming side? We can use streaming results from Netflix NFLX as a small read-through on the level of demand among consumers. Let’s take a closer look.Netflix ImpressesStrong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has overall been the name of the game for Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.Disney Outlook Remains BearishAnalysts haven’t been bullish for Disney’s quarter to be reported, with the current $1.18 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down roughly 3% since the beginning of February. The value suggests a 3% pullback YoY, whereas sales are expected to grow 5% to $23.1 billion.The company exited its latest period with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscriptions, and more than 120 million Disney+ Core paid subscribers, which reflected an increase of 4.4 million over the prior quarter.So while the company has seen overall subscriber growth, the pace relative to NFLX is much lower, likely a reflection of NFLX’s successful business implementations that got them back on track to subscriber growth.The broader revisions picture for Disney also remains bearish, with the stock sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to negative revisions across the board.Bottom LineWe’ve got a big-time entertainment giant on the reporting docket this week – Disney DIS. A peer concerning streaming, Netflix NFLX, posted notably strong results, reporting great growth overall.Analysts haven’t been bullish regarding Disney’s earnings outlook, with the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate seeing negative revisions since February. Its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating also reflects a broader negative revisions picture overall.

Netflix’s Trillion-Dollar Baby Ambition: Realistic or Ridiculous?,1745510280000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , by far the world’s most dominant pure-play streaming stock, just had its eye-popping intentions revealed. A report from the Wall Street Journal says that the company is aiming to grow its market capitalization to $1 trillion by the year 2030 . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix would need to add a whopping $650 billion to its market cap over the next five years to achieve this goal.This would mean adding value around four times the current market cap of one of its largest competitors, the Walt Disney Company NYSE:DIS . This alone demonstrates the monumental task Netflix is undertaking. This analysis will examine what Netflix needs to do to achieve this target , both from a return standpoint and from a business perspective. Can this communications leader realistically attain membership in the $1 trillion club ? This may not be as improbable as it initially sounds.20% Return CAGR or Bust: Netflix’s Journey to $1 TrillionAssuming Netflix aims to achieve this goal by the end of 2030, it would likely need to  massively outperform the market . The S&P 500 Index has averaged around a 10% annual return since 1957. The stock would need to grow from its Apr. 23 closing market cap of about $447 billion to $1 trillion in roughly 4.5 years. That would require a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), or about double the S&P 500’s historical return. That’s close to the 19% CAGR Netflix stock delivered over the past 4.5 years, although returns tend to get harder as a stock grows.However, size is by no means mutually exclusive from large returns. Take Magnificent Seven stocks Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , and Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG for example. They have achieved return CAGRs of 25%, 23%, and 20% , respectively, over the last five years. An argument certainly exists that once a company achieves a level of size and dominance, it significantly increases its ability to expand its business. Companies of immense size have the ability to make huge bets that can result in massive payoffs. They can also exert their market power to destroy competitors. Overall, simply from a return viewpoint, Netflix’s $1 trillion mission by 2030 is a big hill to climb, but it is far from outside the realm of possibility.Keys to $1 Trillion: Doubling Down on Global Growth and Ad MonetizationOn the business side, Netflix has several key metrics it aims to hit to reach the imposing $1 trillion mark. It wants to add over 100 million new subscribers, growing to 410 million users from the current 302 million. Further expansion into countries like India and Brazil is one path Netflix sees to do this. These added subscribers will go toward doubling total revenues from $39 billion annually in 2024 to $78 billion in 2030. Within this, Netflix wants to grow its advertising sales to $9 billion annually. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Targeting India makes a lot of sense when it comes to growing subscriptions. It is the world’s most populous country, with nearly 1.5 billion people. Netflix already has a decent foothold there, with approximately 12 million subscribers. Experts expect the number of internet users in India to surpass 900 million in 2025. That points to a massive opportunity for Netflix, which remains significantly underpenetrated in the country. Making meaningful gains there could go a long way in helping Netflix reach its subscriber targets.Netflix also has a huge ability to grow its advertising business. Data from eMarketer shows how U.S. adults spend nearly an equal amount of their time online using Netflix as they do on Meta’s apps and YouTube. However, Netflix accounts for less than 1% of total ad spending. Meanwhile, Meta raked in 21% of total ad spending, and YouTube saw over 5%. This highlights that while overall engagement on Netflix is strong , ad monetization remains low, presenting a significant revenue growth opportunity. The company’s new ad-tech stack, Ads Suite, should help drive monetization.Although Netflix’s $1 trillion target may seem daunting when taken at face value, it's not as crazy as it sounds. The company has many ways to drive its stock higher, even outside of the avenues discussed above. When it comes to reaching a $1 trillion market cap, it makes sense not to count Netflix out.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:413912ff2094b:0-netflix-s-trillion-dollar-baby-ambition-realistic-or-ridiculous/
ProSieben boards advise against takeover bid from Berlusconis' MFE,1747909089000,"The boards of ProSiebenSat.1 XETR:PSM have advised against an ""inadequate"" takeover bid from MFE-MediaForEurope MIL:MFEA , the TV broadcaster controlled by Italy's Berlusconi family, the German broadcaster said on ThursdayMFE, which has commercial TV operations in Italy and Spain, made an offer for ProSieben in March as part of a push to create a pan-European broadcaster - a strategy resisted by ProSieben, which is striving to remain independent. ""Both governing bodies have concluded that the offer is inadequate from a financial perspective,"" ProSiebenSat.1 said in a statement, adding that it ""does not reflect the expected future development of the value of the company"".Milan-listed MFE, which holds a 30.14% stake in ProSieben declined to comment.Earlier this month, Czech investment firm PPF, which holds a 15% stake in ProSiben, launched a bid to lift its stake in the German broadcaster up to 29.99%, a move welcomed by ProSiebenSat.MFE made a cash-and-share bid at the minimum level allowed by German takeover rules, offering 4.48 euros in cash and 0.4 MFE A shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share.That is below the current share price of 7.09 euros and PPF's offer of 7 euros per share. Having already crossed a 30% threshold which normally triggers a mandatory 100% takeover offer under German law, MFE will have the option to buy additional shares in the market after the end of its buyout bid.However, a source close to the matter told Reuters last week that it is also weighing whether to raise its bid in response to the counter-proposal by PPF.MFE is looking to build a European ad-funded TV platform to resist competition from the likes of U.S. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and is pushing for an accelerated sale of ProSiebenSat.1's online investments in order to reduce its debt.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RU0ON:0-prosieben-boards-advise-against-takeover-bid-from-berlusconis-mfe/"
Netflix's Trillion-Dollar Dream: Should Investors Buy the Stock Now?,1745509140000,"Netflix NFLX has set its sights on an ambitious target that has caught the attention of investors worldwide: doubling its revenues by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. This bold declaration comes on the heels of the streaming giant's impressive first-quarter 2025 performance, which saw the company beat earnings expectations with $6.61 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.17% and jumping 54.8% year over year. (Read More: Netflix Q1 Earnings Beat, Revenues Rise Y/Y on Subscriber Gain).The company has consistently outperformed market indices, with a 39.1% six-month return, significantly outpacing other streaming competitors like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500. Shares of Apple, Disney and Amazon have lost 11.6%, 8.1% and 3.8%, respectively, in the same time frame.NFLX Outperforms Sector, CompetitionThe Growth Strategy Behind the Trillion-Dollar VisionNetflix's path to a trillion-dollar valuation isn't just wishful thinking — it's backed by a comprehensive growth strategy focused on four key areas. The company plans to expand its already robust content library, further develop its increasingly successful live programming options, enhance its gaming division, and build out its rapidly growing advertising business. NFLX’s content diversity spans genres, languages, and formats, creating multiple growth engines for the company. In the second quarter, new films include Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Tyler Perry's new drama Straw starring Taraji P. Henson, Bullet Train Explosion (Japan) and Havoc , an action thriller starring Tom Hardy and Forest Whitaker. New series include Forever , a modern-day take on the classic Judy Blume novel; romantic comedy The Royals (India); The Four Seasons , a comedy starring Tina Fey, Steve Carell and Colman Domingo; El Eternauta (Argentina); and Ransom Canyon , a romantic western. America’s Sweethearts: The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders , Black Mirror and Ginny & Georgia are all back for brand new seasons. Netflix has also slated the series finales of the Emmy Award-winning adult animated series Big Mouth and fan-favorite YOU . Furthermore, Netflix's live programming strategy has already delivered notable successes, including the Paul-Tyson fight, which became the most-streamed sporting event ever. The company also recently secured the U.S. rights for FIFA's Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031, demonstrating its commitment to strategic live content acquisition rather than pursuing expensive regular-season sports packages.Ad-Supported Tier: The Hidden Growth AcceleratorPerhaps the most promising aspect of Netflix's growth strategy is its advertising business. According to company data, more than 55% of new subscribers in markets where it's available are choosing the ad-supported option. Management projects advertising revenues reaching $9 billion annually by 2030, representing a significant new revenue stream.The company recently launched its Ad Suite in the United States on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025 alone, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment. This diversification of revenue streams adds stability to Netflix's growth trajectory and reduces its reliance solely on subscription growth.Financial Health Supports Long-Term AmbitionNetflix's financial position remains robust, with first-quarter 2025 revenues reaching $10.54 billion, up 12.5% year over year. The operating margin expanded impressively to 31.7%, up 370 basis points year over year. Free cash flow for the quarter was pinned at $2.66 billion compared with $1.37 billion in the previous quarter.For the second quarter of 2025, Netflix forecasts revenues to increase 15.4% to $11.035 billion and projects an operating margin of 33%, representing a ~6 percentage point year-over-year improvement. The company maintains its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion and free cash flow forecast of approximately $8 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.47 billion, indicating 14.01% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $25.33 per share, indicating a 27.74% increase from the previous year.See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news .Premium Valuation Justified by Exceptional PerformanceWhile Netflix trades at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 9.77 compared to the broader Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.91, this valuation appears justified given the company's unique position at the intersection of technology and entertainment. Netflix's ability to outcompete both traditional media companies and tech giants speaks to its exceptional business model and execution.NFLX’s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Premium ValuationInvestment Opportunity in 2025For investors, Netflix presents a compelling opportunity in 2025. NFLX's strong content lineup for 2025, including new seasons of its biggest shows like Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things , positions the company for continued subscriber growth. Combined with its expanding advertising business, innovative gaming initiatives, and strategic live programming acquisitions, Netflix has multiple catalysts to drive growth toward its trillion-dollar ambition.Investors should consider that Netflix continues to hold a leadership position in engagement (approximately two hours per paid membership per day), revenues ($39 billion), and profit ($10 billion in operating income) in a market that continues to expand. With streaming still representing less than 10% of TV hours globally, Netflix has substantial runway for growth.For long-term investors seeking exposure to the continuing evolution of global entertainment consumption, Netflix's strategic vision and execution capabilities make it a compelling buy in 2025, despite its premium valuation. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Movie-Tariff Plan Rattles Media Stocks. The Fine Print Will Be Critical. — Barrons.com,1746480480000,"By Elsa Ohlen and Angela PalumboShares of U.S. media companies fell as President Donald Trump took aim at the movie industry, saying he will impose a 100% import tax on films produced abroad.""I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday night. He referred to efforts by other countries to create incentives for domestic production as a national security threat.""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,"" a White House spokesperson said.Netflix fell 1.9%, Warner Bros slid 2%, while Paramount was down 1.6%. Cinemark shares dropped 1.7%. Walt Disney slipped 0.4% and Comcast was flat.The S&P 500 was down 0.6%.None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment.Trump's announcement comes after China said in April that it was cutting imports of American films following U.S. tariff decisions. A tariff on films also would mark a shift in the Trump administration's trade policy. Until now, the White House has focused on taxing physical goods, not services.Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan said the tariff announcement ""injects further noise into sentiment for essentially every entertainment stock.""While tariffs risk denting the profitability of movie makers because a decent chunk of Hollywood's output is shot overseas to take advantage of tax benefits and other incentives, the extent of the damage would depend on the fine print. It wasn't clear whether movies and TV shows shot overseas but finished in the U.S., or content made abroad but available to U.S. audiences, would be subject to the tariff.Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a research note on Monday that it was also unclear if these tariffs would be strictly designed for movies set for theatrical releases, or will also affect streamed-only films. That would be a crucial distinction for a company like Netflix, which releases its originals on its streaming platform.""We think the large studios and distributors including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount, Comcast/NBC Universal, Lionsgate, and Sony, and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" she wrote.For now, analysts are sticking with their stock recommendations and share-price targets, though Reese noted that the news could weigh on movie companies in the near term. She reiterated a Neutral rating on Cinemark with a price target of $32, citing uncertainty around tariffs.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The show will also remain available on PBS, which will receive new episodes the same day they debut on Netflix. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting confirmed it is terminating a federal program that previously funded children's content like Sesame Street .The platform shift comes as Netflix increases its investment in children's programming, which accounts for about 15% of its total viewership. The company also announced new Peppa Pig episodes and a related mobile game featuring puzzles and coloring.Sesame Street , which first aired in 1969, was created with input from child psychologists and Muppet designer Jim Henson to promote early learning. It has long tackled public policy themes, from childhood obesity to arts education, and has featured public figures like Michelle Obama promoting healthy habits.The deal gives Sesame Street access to Netflix's 300 million global subscribers, expanding its reach beyond U.S. public television at a time of shifting media budgets and policy pressure.- See Netflix insider trades. - Explore Netflix's Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:06aa4f229094b:0-netflix-nflx-adds-sesame-street-after-trump-cuts-pbs-funding/

Epic Games' Fortnite returns to Apple App Store in US after nearly 5 years,1747781346000,"Epic Games' wildly popular multiplayer shooter game ""Fortnite"" is available again on Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL App Store in the U.S. from Tuesday, capping a ban of nearly five years and marking a major win for the video game company. Epic Games, a U.S.-based studio backed by China's Tencent HKEX:700 , has been locked in a legal battle with Apple since 2020. Epic Games alleged the iPhone maker's practice of charging a commission of up to 30% on in-app payments violated U.S. antitrust rules.Fortnite's return to Apple's iOS systems in the U.S. follows an April 30 ruling by a federal judge saying that Apple violated a U.S. court order that required the company to allow greater competition for app downloads and payment methods in its App Store. The ruling also said that Apple had failed to comply with the judge's prior injunction order and would be referred to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Fortnite's return to its App Store. ""We back fam,"" Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on social media platform X.Launched in 2017, Fortnite became an instant hit, drawing millions of players around the world thanks to its last-player-standing, ""battle royale"" format. At the time of the ban, Epic had 116 million users just on Apple's platform.""For Epic Games this was a hard fought win that carried a very steep price and may be too late to boost its Fortnite game that is now past its prime,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""For Apple this is another crack in the armor that the services business relies on — the funneling of payments through Apple in order to charge developers for every transaction.""Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, said this opened the door for subscription apps like Spotify NYSE:SPOT and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX to claw back margin and for independent studios to monetize without having to pay Apple an extra commission, potentially reshaping iOS economics over the next 12-18 months. Apple and Alphabet's Google NASDAQ:GOOG had banned Fortnite from their stores in 2020 over a tussle about in-app payment guidelines. The game had already returned to Google's Android devices worldwide and iPhones in the EU last year.The game title was also available on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union, Fortnite said on X on Tuesday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RS1LP:0-epic-games-fortnite-returns-to-apple-app-store-in-us-after-nearly-5-years/"

The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters delivering an average beat of 6.9%. Moreover, NFLX has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions (+3.1%) for 2025 in the last seven days. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 13.9% and 27.3%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2025. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 11.6% and 20.3%, respectively.Visibility Remains HighThe primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Buoyed by its scalable ad business, NFLX is expected to leverage its own proprietary ad system, doling away with Microsoft Corp. MSFT as its ad-tech partner. The company’s policies of offering ad-supported lower-prices tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Attractive Valuation of NFLX SharesOn Feb 14, the stock price touched its all-time high of $1,064.5.

The company has a return on equity (ROE) of 39.6% compared with the S&P 500’s ROE of 17% and the industry’s ROE of 6.2%.

Netflix (NFLX) Slips as Trump Floats Movie Tariff Plan,1746476532000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) took a hit Monday after former President Donald Trump announced plans for a 100% tariff on foreign-made films.

Discovery. Though the White House later said no final decision had been made, the uncertainty shook investor confidence.The problem: entertainment isnt like traditional goods. Experts raised questions about how a tariff on movies would even work. Would it apply to shows? International co-productions? Visual effects?Netflix has a lot at stake. More than half of its 2024 content budget went toward non-North American productions, and nearly 70% of its subscribers live outside the U.S. and Canada.

2 Reasons Netflix’s 40% Rally Is Far From Over,1747765860000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Shares of  Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on an absolute tear in recent weeks.They’re now  up more than 40% since the first week of April, breaking through previous records and entering the rarefied four-figure price range . While that kind of move tends to raise concerns about overheating, especially with the RSI now at 68 , there are still two major reasons to believe the rally could continue into the summer, and why any pullback should be viewed as a buying opportunity.1. Fundamentals Are Red HotNetflix’s latest earnings release firmly put its growth story in the spotlight. The company reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that came in well ahead of expectations, with the latter up 12.5% year-over-year . But what stood out most were the operating metrics. Operating income climbed 27% , while operating margin reached 32% , up from 28% a year earlier . Management also guided to even stronger profitability , forecasting a 33% margin for Q2 and reaffirming their full-year target of 29% .The top-line outlook was also upgraded. Netflix now expects full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion , up from previous guidance and above consensus estimates .This reflects not only price increases and membership growth but also a sharp uptick in ad revenue , which the company says will roughly double in 2025.Subscriber growth was another standout.Netflix added 18.91 million net new subscribers in the quarter, blowing away expectations of 9.18 million . It was the highest quarterly net addition in company history, showing the platform is still gaining traction despite rising competition and market maturity.2. Wall Street Is Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Following that blowout report, analysts have begun to revise their targets higher. Last week, Wolfe Research reiterated its bullish stance and issued a new price target of $1,340. This echoed the call from Robert Baird who lifted its target to $1,300 , while Canaccord Genuity Group went even further, calling for $1,380 .Those targets imply more than 15% upside from where the stock closed on Monday. That’s a significant projection for a company of Netflix’s size, especially after such a strong run. It also shows that many believe this is not the top but rather a new baseline from which the next leg higher can form.These bullish forecasts are backed by Netflix’s ability to monetize its subscriber base through pricing, premium content, and a fast-growing ad business. With record subscriber growth and rising profitability, the company is executing at a level few of the tech giants can match.Why One Major Firm Just Turned CautiousEven with Netflix firing on all cylinders, some analysts are beginning to voice caution, not about the business, but the stock’s near-term setup. On Monday, J.P. Morgan  downgraded Netflix to Neutral from Overweight , citing a more balanced risk/reward profile following the stock’s significant rally.With shares hitting all-time highs and trading at roughly 39x 2026 earnings and 44x free cash flow , the valuation has started to limit the upside in the short term.The firm still sees Netflix as a long-term leader in global streaming, driven by top-tier content, accelerating profitability, and a dominant position in the shift away from linear TV. But with macro conditions improving and market risk appetite broadening, the team there expects some capital rotation away from defensive names like Netflix toward more beaten-down sectors.What to Watch in the Weeks AheadThey also noted that following recent events like the company’s  Upfront presentation , Netflix may face a quieter period on the catalyst front as it heads into summer, even with strong Q3 content on deck .Still, the structural bull case remains intact . Netflix’s ability to scale globally, grow advertising revenue, and retain its content advantage means pullbacks should be seen in context: as a natural pause in a longer-term uptrend , not a reversal.

'Sesame Street' Finds a New Home on Netflix — WSJ,1747679640000,"By Joseph De AvilaElmo and Cookie Monster are heading to Netflix.The streaming giant has reached an agreement to broadcast new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" giving the beloved children's show a home after Warner Bros. Discovery said it was stepping away from the program.The agreement, which begins with the upcoming 56th season, includes 90 hours of previous episodes. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization that produces ""Sesame Street, "" said new episodes will also air on PBS stations and PBS Kids the same day they debut on Netflix. PBS has broadcast ""Sesame Street"" for over 50 years. Under its previous deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, PBS could only show new episodes months after they aired on HBO.The deal serves ""as a unique public-private partnership to enable 'Sesame Street' to continue to help children everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder,"" Sesame Workshop said.Warner Bros. Discovery said in December it wouldn't renew its deal with Sesame Workshop to air new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" leaving the show in limbo. The show began airing on HBO in 2016, before moving to HBO's streaming service in 2020. Warner Bros. Discovery will retain rights to the Sesame Street library through 2027.Sesame Workshop, which generates the majority of its revenue through licensing and distribution fees and royalties, has struggled financially in recent months. In March, Sesame Workshop's CEO told staff it would ""downsize significantly,"" citing the end of the HBO deal and the loss of federal funds as factors.Public media has been under fire of late, with President Trump seeking to end federal funding for PBS and National Public Radio. In his executive order signed earlier this month, Trump said ""neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""One of the longest-running shows on television, ""Sesame Street"" has aired more than 4,500 episodes since its debut in 1969. Since its inception, Sesame Street has focused on both entertaining and educating children.Major streaming services have changed their approach to children's entertainment in recent years, as they try to compete with YouTube. With ""Sesame Street,"" Netflix adds to its roster of children's programming that already includes ""Peppa Pig,"" ""Cocomelon,"" and ""Ms. Rachel.""The new episodes on Netflix will feature new segments and some format changes, including 11-minute, character-driven stories. There will be a new animated segment called ""Tales from 123"" about the apartment building where Elmo and Cookie Monster live.Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250519005919:0/
"For Netflix, the Mere Threat of Tariffs is Bad Enough — Heard on the Street — WSJ",1746474240000,"By Dan GallagherWall Street sees President Trump's ""Hollywood Tariffs"" as unlikely. But Netflix wasn't even priced for the possibility.The streaming giant's share price was down a little over 1% by Monday afternoon. That's an improvement over the stock's 4% drop around the day's opening bell, which followed Trump announcing a plan for 100% tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands."" The announcement hit movie stocks across the board.Trump's announcement-made over his Truth Social network-was scant on details. But some analysts so far are skeptical. ""We think the Trump administration will face tremendous pushback,"" wrote Michael Pachter of Wedbush in a note to clients. Doug Creutz of TD Cowen described the tariffs as ""politically charged, logistically challenging, and ultimately unlikely to advance meaningfully"" in his own report.But unlike traditional media stocks that have mostly been in a slump this year, Netflix shares have been flying high. The stock was mostly unscathed by Trump's initial tariff announcements in early April, due to the belief that subscription-based streaming services like Netflix and Spotify would be largely immune to the effects of such measures. Netflix shares also got an additional boost from a strong first-quarter report on April 17.All told, Netflix was up 30% for the year by the end of last week, compared to a 4% drop for the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Group. That run had put Netflix shares to a multiple of about 42 times projected earnings-40% higher than what the stock was fetching a year ago and nearly triple Disney's multiple.In a report Monday, Jason Bazinet of Citigroup estimated a ""worst-case"" of about $3 billion a year in additional costs to Netflix from the tariffs Trump outlined, but added that the company ""has a range of options at its disposal to limit the impact."" Still, he noted that the idea of Netflix as a ""safe haven"" from tariffs is now under threat. Even safe havens have their price.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

Netflix Could Get a Boost From Live Events. J.P. Morgan Downgraded It Anyway. — Barrons.com,1747674660000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix shares could continue to shine if the streaming company keeps hosting sporting events, but that didn't stop one J.P. Morgan analyst from downgrading the stock on Monday.Doug Anmuth downgraded the shares to Neutral from Overweight while also raising his price target to $1,220 from $1,150.""To be clear, there's no change to our long-term bullish view on NFLX's streaming leadership position & the company's potential to effectively become global TV over time,"" Anmuth wrote in a research note on Monday. ""However, more near-term, following significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, we believe the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced.""Shares of Netflix were down 0.6% on Monday to $1,184.75. The stock has surged 33% this year, far outperforming the 1% increase of the S&P 500 in 2025.Wall Street hasn't only been pleased with Netflix's performance over the last few quarters, but is also confident it can withstand economic turmoil.Netflix has been performing well because of the company's decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-price ad tier. The changes led to more people opening their own accounts and provided users with a cheaper option, which could prevent subscription cancellations if times get tough. Netflix has also introduced live events to its streaming platform, including comedy roasts and NFL games.""Live events/sports content could also drive strong engagement, ad dollars, & subscriber growth,"" Anmuth wrote.Netflix is hosting two NFL games on Christmas again this year. The 2024 Christmas games were the two most streamed NFL games in U.S. history, according to Netflix.A CNBC reporter also said on The Town podcast May 16 that he spoke to one of the co-CEOs of Netflix who ""admitted to me, like, 'Yeah, I talked to [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell on the side about adding even more games beyond our two Christmas games.'""Barron's has reached out to Netflix and the NFL for comment.But while Netflix investors may be excited about the idea of the company hosting more live events down the line, there are still risks to the stock.President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""There aren't many details, but increased costs could hurt margins and potentially push Netflix to raise prices. Netflix is also at risk of people trading down to lower-priced subscription offerings or canceling if tariffs take a bite out of their budgets. Data from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment fell to its second-lowest reading on record in May.Investors will have to decide whether to follow Anmuth's advice and wait on the sidelines, or bet on a streaming service that continues to outperform.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Discovery stock was rising Wednesday after the media and entertainment company revealed a new feature for its Max streaming service that sets the stage for a password-sharing crackdown.Warner Bros. said late Tuesday that it would roll out Extra Member Add-Ons for Max, allowing users to add someone who doesn't live in their household on their account for an additional $7.99 a month.Shares climbed 5.9% to $8.41 in early trading. The S&P 500 was up 2.4%.The feature is ""designed to help viewers with a new way to enjoy our best-in-class content at an exceptional value, and offer subscribers greater flexibility in managing their accounts,"" the conglomerate's CEO and President for global streaming and games JB Perrette said in a statement.The move could pave the way for Max to clamp down on password sharing outside of the household. Similar changes made by Netflix a couple of years ago have helped boost the streamer's revenue, sparking a rally that has lifted its shares to a record high.Some investors might question the timing of this move, though: Warner Bros. is pushing for extra revenue at a time when forecasters are worried that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans could drive up inflation and cause consumers to cut back on spending. If that happens, there's a chance some users could decide a Max account isn't worth the money if they can't share it, and cancel their subscription altogether.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

4 Broadcast Radio & TV Stocks to Buy From a Prospering Industry,1745410800000,"The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has been grappling with an escalation in cord-cutting despite a surge in demand for streaming content. However, industry players such as Netflix NFLX, Gray Media GTN, Fox Corporation FOXA and TEGNA TGNA, are reaping the benefits of a massive spike in digital content consumption. These companies are thriving due to their diverse content offerings, which include original, regional, and short-form content tailored for small screens like smartphones and tablets. Improved Internet speed and penetration, coupled with technological advancements, have been advantageous for industry participants. As monetization and revenues from advertising spending continue to be modest, strategies focused on profit protection, cash management and greater technology integration have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving top-line growth in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry encompasses companies that provide entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction, and musical content across television, radio, and digital media platforms. These entities generate revenues through the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions. With technological advancements and a growing demand for virtual reality and Internet radio, industry players are increasing their investments in research and development, as well as sales and marketing efforts, to remain competitive. The industry's focus is likely to shift toward sustaining current levels of operations, coupled with a renewed emphasis on flexibility. This approach would accelerate the transition to a variable cost model, thereby reducing fixed costs and enhancing agility in the face of evolving market dynamics.4 Broadcast Radio and Television Industry Trends to WatchShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst : To adapt to the evolving landscape, companies are diversifying their content offerings for over-the-top (OTT) services alongside traditional linear TV. The availability of streaming services across a wide range of platforms has enabled them to reach a global audience, expand their international user base and attract advertisers to their platforms, thereby boosting ad revenues. The utilization of services that aid advertisers in measuring their return on investment and enhancing use cases is expected to benefit industry participants. Major leagues and events, such as the NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections, also contribute significantly to ad revenue generation.Increased Digital Viewing Fuels Content Demand : Many industry participants, either launching their own OTT services or acquiring existing ones, leverage user insights to deliver tailored content. The surge in digital viewing has made consumer data readily available, allowing companies to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to create or procure targeted content. This approach not only boosts user engagement but also enables industry players to raise the prices of their services at opportune moments without the fear of losing subscribers.Uncertain Macroeconomic Landscape Impedes Production and Ad Demand : Advertising is a significant revenue source for the Broadcast Radio and Television industry. However, industry participants are grappling with the effects of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, increased capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and the looming threat of a recession. These factors have prompted advertisers to trim their ad budgets, which is expected to impact the top-line growth of industry players in the near term. Moreover, intense competition for ad dollars from tech and social media companies has been a significant impediment to the growth of industry participants.Low-Priced Skinny Bundles Impact Revenues : The surge in cord-cutting has compelled industry participants to offer ""skinny bundles."" These Internet-based services often contain fewer channels than traditional subscriptions and are, therefore, more affordable. This move aligns with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing. While these alternative services are expected to keep users engaged with their platforms, increasing the need for additional content, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen the top-line performance of industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide.

"Media, Streaming Stocks Fall as Trump Proposes 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Made Movies",1746464371000,"Shares of major media, streaming and television companies were down Monday after US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff rate on foreign-produced films, with Wedbush Securities saying that Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD and Paramount Global NASDAQ:PARA are among the companies that face a ""significant amount"" of risk. In a social media post Sunday, Trump said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative to immediately start the process of imposing 100% duties on ""any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands."" Other nations are offering ""all sorts of incentives"" to pull American filmmakers and studios away from the US, thus impacting Hollywood, he said. Shares of Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX declined 2.1% in Monday afternoon trade, while Disney edged down 0.4%. Warner Bros decreased 1.2%, Paramount fell 1.1% and Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA nudged 0.2% lower. Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , which owns the Amazon Prime streaming service, was down 1.6%. ""We think the large studios and distributors including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount, Comcast/NBC Universal, Lionsgate, and Sony TSE:6758 , and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" Wedbush analysts, including Alicia Reese, said in a Monday note to clients. As long as there's some production in the US, a tariff could likely be avoided or minimized, the analysts said. The Motion Picture Association of America didn't immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment. Trump's move is likely to draw a ""tremendous pushback,"" initially from other countries that may impose tariffs or announce an outright ban on US-produced content, and eventually from Congress, according to Wedbush. The brokerage said it's currently not clear if Trump's proposed tariffs will apply to ticket sales or the entire value chain, including streaming. In the near term, studios can shift some portion of their production to the US with logistical adjustments and higher tax rates, unless cities offer ""similar"" tax relief as the foreign territories provided, Wedbush said. The brokerage assumed that 75% of Netflix's overall content is produced overseas, with foreign language content all international and a ""large percentage"" of domestic production moved to the UK and Canada for cost savings. The streaming giant has ""little control"" over where the vast majority of its content is produced, according to the note. Wedbush said it's is unsure if the tariffs will apply to Netflix's already-produced content or newly produced projects. ""Despite the headline risk, we maintain that Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad-tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,"" the analysts said.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250505:A3369439:0/

"JPMorgan cuts Netflix rating, citing balanced risk-reward post-rally; stock falls",1747653114000,"Shares of Netflix fell over 2.3% in premarket trading Monday after JPMorgan downgraded the streaming giant to “neutral” from “overweight”, even as it raised its price target on the stock to $1,220 from $1,150. The new target implies a modest 2.38% upside from the company’s last close at $1,191.53. The company has also removed Netflix from the US Equity Analyst Focus List, it said.The downgrade comes despite JPMorgan reiterating its belief in Netflix’s long-term leadership in the global streaming industry and its potential to effectively become the world’s dominant TV platform. Few near-term catalysts; easing trade fears could shift focus: JPMorganNetflix shares have surged more than 34% so far in 2025, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Movies & Entertainment index, which has risen 20.87%. The stock also recently crossed the $500 billion market capitalization mark for the first time, underscoring investor confidence in the company’s business model and growth potential.However, the brokerage said the stock’s significant rally over recent months has made the risk/reward outlook more evenly balanced in the near term.Analysts said the sharp gains likely reflect much of the upside embedded in the company’s 2025 earnings guidance. As a result, they see limited near-term catalysts to drive the stock substantially higher.It also said that while the company’s shares have held up well, if concerns about tariffs and the broader economy continue to ease, investors may shift their focus to other internet stocks and market sectors that have been more vulnerable & pressured.A safe haven in a volatile marketNetflix’s recent stock gains have been attributed to its perceived immunity from tariff threats and economic uncertainty. The company imports entertainment, not physical goods, insulating it from the cost pressures that have hit other firms amid escalating trade tensions. Even when former President Donald Trump floated a 100% import duty on foreign films, Netflix stock fell just 2% as investors bet the company could adjust by shifting production to the US or raising subscription prices.Moreover, Netflix has historically performed well during periods of economic stress. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it posted double-digit gains as homebound users streamed popular titles.That history has made it a preferred choice among investors seeking stability.According to data compiled by LSEG, the average rating of 51 analysts on Netflix is a “buy”, with a median PT of $1,150.Valuation concerns begin to surfaceAt around 43 times forward earnings, Netflix’s valuation has become a topic of concern. It trades at a premium compared to the S&P 500’s multiple of 21 and even the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants, which average 27.However, the company has historically commanded a higher premium. Its average P/E ratio over the past five years stands at 52.Ben James, a strategist at Baillie Gifford’s US growth fund, told Barron’s that the stock’s transformation from a speculative content spender to a profitable business has justified its valuation. The firm, which owns roughly 4 million Netflix shares valued at $4.5 billion, remains optimistic that operating margins could nearly double from the current 27% to as high as 50% by 2030.“It’s invested so much in its own content that it’s built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,” James said. “When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it’s over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.”Looking ahead to 2030Executives are reportedly targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of the decade, according to The Wall Street Journal . While the company has surpassed the critical $500 billion mark, the it will need to sustain rapid earnings growth and margin expansion to hit that milestone. While short-term valuations may limit further gains, many investors remain focused on the long-term narrative that Netflix will continue to shape the future of global entertainment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:eeb6d554c094b:0-jpmorgan-cuts-netflix-rating-citing-balanced-risk-reward-post-rally-stock-falls/
"Impact of Trump's Planned Tariffs on Foreign Films Still Unclear for Netflix, Wedbush Says",1746458519000,"It's unclear to what extent the Trump administration's planned tariffs on foreign films will apply to Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , Wedbush said in a research note Monday. President Donald Trump said Sunday in a social media post he plans to impose a 100% tariff on movies shot outside the US, according to media reports. ""We do not know the extent to which this will apply to Netflix,"" Wedbush said. ""We do not know if this will apply to already-produced or only apply to newly produced content.""Wedbush said that ""75% of Netflix's overall content is produced internationally, with foreign language content all international and a large percentage of domestic production moved to Canada and the UK for cost savings.""The ""portion of Netflix's $18 billion in content spending that is newly produced is likely only around $3 billion-$5 billion, and of that, only $2 billion-$3 billion is foreign produced,"" the investment firm said. ""The balance of its spending is for content that was produced prior to the materialization of Trump's whim and caprice, and an interpretation of his 'idea' will determine whether the impact will be felt in 2025 or in 2026 and beyond,"" the note said. Also, Trump's planned tariffs on films made outside the US will likely ""face tremendous pushback, initially from foreign countries imposing tariffs (or an outright ban) on US-produced content, and eventually from Congress,"" the note said. Meanwhile, even amid this ""headline risk,"" Netflix is ""positioned to accelerate ad tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,"" the investment firm said. Wedbush reiterated its outperform rating on Netflix.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250505:A3369427:0/
"Why Netflix Is the ""Cleanest Story in Tech""",1745325900000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX delivered a convincing performance in its first-quarter 2025 earnings report on Apr. 17, surpassing analyst expectations on key financial metrics and offering a confident outlook for the coming quarter.The strong results provided fresh evidence for a narrative gaining traction that  Netflix represents a uniquely resilient growth story within a technology sector that is currently grappling with economic uncertainty and trade tariff anxieties.As competitors may struggle to maintain momentum, Netflix’s sustained subscriber growth and expanding profitability continue to set it apart.Earnings Show Record Margins and Strong GrowthNetflix's financial results for the first quarter showed strong growth and increased profitability. Revenue rose 12.5% year over year (16% on a foreign exchange-neutral basis) to $10.54 billion, slightly exceeding Netflix’s analyst community’s consensus estimate of $10.51 billion.Operating income increased by 27%, reaching $3.35 billion, which resulted in a record-high operating margin of 31.7%, up from 28.1% in Q1 2024. This demonstrates successful cost management and scaling benefits.Netflix expects continued momentum in the second quarter of 2025, forecasting $11.04 billion in revenue (15% year-over-year growth, or 17% on a foreign exchange-neutral basis) and a potential record operating margin of 33.3%, with diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) expected to be $7.03. The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, targeting revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and a 29% operating margin.During the earnings call, management noted that the company was tracking above the midpoint of its full-year revenue guidance range based on more recent currency rates. At the same time, free cash flow for the year is still expected to be approximately $8 billion.The ""Defensive Edge"": Dodging the Tariff FalloutFollowing strong Q1 results, analysts are increasingly highlighting Netflix's ""defensive"" qualities within the tech sector. JPMorgan NYSE:JPM , for instance, reaffirmed its view, suggesting Netflix could be the ""cleanest story in internet tech"" due to several fundamental aspects of its business that seem to shield it from trade tariffs and broader economic concerns affecting other industries.Unlike hardware companies with intricate global supply chains that are vulnerable to import taxes, Netflix operates mainly as a global digital service. Its revenue, derived from subscriptions and advertising, isn't directly impacted by tariffs on physical goods. Moreover, with most revenue coming from outside the U.S. and no operations in China, Netflix benefits from substantial geographic diversification, lessening risks tied to any single economy or trade conflict.The subscription model, especially with the introduction of a lower-cost ad-supported option, is seen as relatively stable compared to businesses heavily dependent on large, non-essential consumer purchases (such as electronics) or platforms relying solely on potentially fluctuating advertising budgets.During the Q1 earnings call , Netflix management stated that they haven't observed any significant adverse effects on subscriber retention, cancellations, or plan choices due to recent price hikes or wider economic uncertainty. Co-CEO Greg Peters also highlighted the historical resilience of entertainment spending during economic downturns. This perceived stability contrasts sharply with the challenges faced by many other tech companies.Growth Engines Firing on All Cylinders [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix's strong financial performance is strategically driven through several key initiatives. Their entry into advertising, particularly the ad-supported tier, is a significant growth engine, attracting new subscribers (over 55% of new sign-ups in ad markets during Q4 2024) and experiencing rapid membership growth (nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q4'24).Netflix aims to further monetize this with the launch of ""Netflix Ads Suite,"" which began in the US on Apr. 1 and will expand to other ad markets in 2025. This service offers enhanced targeting and measurement for advertisers and will boost this high-profit revenue stream.The ""paid sharing"" initiative, addressing password sharing, has successfully converted non-paying viewers into subscribers or new account holders, significantly increasing revenue and contributing to record global paid net additions in 2024.These monetization strategies are built upon Netflix's extensive and diverse content library. The company's significant investment in original productions across genres and languages for a global audience remains central. Beyond streaming, Netflix is evolving its gaming strategy, concentrating on key genres, utilizing its intellectual property, and exploring cloud gaming. Experiential ventures like ""Netflix Bites"" and the planned ""Netflix House"" locations indicate a focus on strengthening direct-to-consumer engagement and creating new revenue opportunities.Why Experts Remain Positive on NetflixFollowing Netflix's Q1 earnings report, the financial community expressed strong confidence in the company, and analyst sentiment became even more bullish. Data compiled around Apr. 21 from 36 analysts covering the stock showed a consensus rating of Moderate Buy , with 28 of them maintaining Buy or Strong Buy ratings.Strong institutional backing also supports the bullish stance, with large institutional investors holding approximately 81% of Netflix stock. While insider selling activity has occurred over the last year, it is typical for executives to diversify holdings after significant stock appreciation.Despite its premium valuation, reflected in a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 50 , analysts and investors appear willing to pay the multiple. That’s largely due to the company’s strong fundamentals: demonstrated earnings power, projected future growth, consistent margin expansion, solid free cash flow generation, a dominant market position, and notable resilience in the current economic climate.Netflix Remains a Tech Sector StandoutNetflix's Q1 2025 results solidify its leadership position, showcasing strong financial performance and effective execution across key areas like advertising, paid sharing, and content.Notably, the company has demonstrated resilience against macroeconomic challenges impacting the tech sector. This success has garnered overwhelmingly positive response from Wall Street, with raised price targets and reinforced Buy ratings .The market's confidence in Netflix's ability to navigate uncertainty and sustain profitable growth makes it a compelling investment opportunity in the current market.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:0de9c27c6094b:0-why-netflix-is-the-cleanest-story-in-tech/

Should Investors Buy the Spike in Netflix Stock After Q1 Earnings? ,1745267220000,"Netflix NFLX shares had spiked +3% in this morning's trading session as the streaming giant was able to impressively surpass its Q1 earnings expectations before the Easter Holiday last Thursday. This comes as the broader market has experienced another selloff following the extended holiday weekend, with President Trump's tariffs and his bashing of Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates in focus.Netflix’s Q1 ResultsNetflix’s Q1 earnings came in at $2.89 billion or $6.61 a share, surpassing EPS expectations of $5.69 by 16% and climbing 25% from $5.28 per share a year ago on net income of $2.33 billion. Year over year, Q1 sales rose over 12% to $10.54 billion, although this slightly missed the Zacks Consensus by 0.04%.Notably, Netflix attributed the favorable quarterly results to its successful subscription plans and advertising revenue. It’s also noteworthy that Netflix will no longer provide quarterly subscriber data as the company shifts its focus to revenue growth, among other financial metrics and performance indicators. That said, Netflix has exceeded sales estimates in three of its last four quarterly reports and has surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for five consecutive quarters. Netflix’s Positive GuidanceLooking ahead, Netflix expects Q2 sales at $11 billion which came in above Zacks estimates of $10.96 billion or 14% growth (Current Qtr below). More reassuring is that Netflix expects Q2 EPS at $7.03 and above the current Zacks Consensus of $6.22 per share or 27% growth.Furthermore, Netflix still projects full-year revenue between $43.5 billion-$44.5 billion, which falls in range with Zacks projections of $44.4 billion or 14% growth. Based on Zacks estimates, Netflix’s top line is projected to expand another 11% in fiscal 2026 to $49.44 billion.Why NFLX has been a Defensive HedgePiggybacking on Netflix’s successful subscription plans, analysts have pointed out that the streaming king may be able to sustain and even grow its subscriber base amid economic uncertainty, thanks to its more affordable ad-supported plan, which is offered at $7.99 a month. Optimistically, the ad-supported plan should help the notion of ""Netflix and Chill"" if consumers need to save on dining out or other entertainment expenses. Correlating with such optimism, Netflix stock is up +11% year to date compared to the benchmark S&P 500’s 10% decline and the Nasdaq’s -18%. More impressive, over the last two years, NFLX has skyrocketed +200% to largely outperform the broader index’s returns of roughly +30%.Monitoring Netflix’s P/E ValuationTrading around $1000 a share, Netflix stock is at a 39.7X forward earnings multiple. While this is a premium to the benchmark's 20.3X and its main streaming competitor Disney’s DIS 15.5X, NFLX does trade at a significant discount to its five-year high of 88.5X forward earnings and is closer to the median of 37.3X during this period.Bottom LineFor now, Netflix stock lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). However, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way, given Netflix’s favorable Q1 report and guidance. To that point, earnings estimate revisions may rise in the coming weeks, which would be indicative of more short-term upside and help level Netflix’s P/E valuation if an extended rally from its current levels hasn’t already continued.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:71064366d094b:0-should-investors-buy-the-spike-in-netflix-stock-after-q1-earnings/
Netflix Stock Is Still A Buy Despite Its Lofty Valuation — Barron's,1747445400000,"The shares were a tariff winner, and that won't change even with the China trade deal. By George GloverIn a market that has felt like a horror show for much of 2025, Netflix has been one of the few feel-good stories in town.The video streamer looks like the rare sort of stock that can outperform no matter what happens on the trade front. Its shares, at a recent $1,173.25, have jumped 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a brutal and broad selloff, while the S&P 500 index is up 4.1% over the same period. On Thursday, Netflix was less than $1 billion away from closing with a market value of $500 billion for the first time.It isn't hard to see why Netflix has become one of the market's go-to safe havens. It imports content, not goods, so there's little risk of the White House's reciprocal levies driving up its costs. Shares dipped just 2% the day Trump threatened to impose 100% import duties on foreign movies, as investors realized that the company could mitigate much of the earnings impact by either shifting production to the U.S. or raising its prices.The stock also has a pedigree as a name that can outperform in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, racking up double-digit gains during the Covid-19 pandemic as widespread lockdowns led to users plowing through smash-hit series like Tiger King and The Last Dance.But while other perceived havens like gold could struggle now that the Trump administration has brokered a deal with China to cut most tariffs for 90 days, Netflix ought to be able to build on its strong run this year.The only real mark against the stock right now is valuation. Due to the recent rally, shares aren't cheap — they currently fetch about 43 times future earnings, meaning they're trading at a significant premium to both the benchmark S&P 500, at 21 times, and the Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech names it's often compared with, at 27 times.Still, Netflix has averaged a price/earnings ratio of 52 over the past five years, so judging by recent history it isn't expensive. Over that time the stock has gone from ""a loss-making challenger where everyone was skeptical about how much it's spending on content to a reliable, profitable compounder,"" Ben James, a strategist at the Edinburgh-based investment management firm Baillie Gifford's U.S. growth fund, tells Barron's. The firm holds a little more than 4 million shares, a position that's valued at about $4.5 billion.The bull case hinges on the idea that the streamer will be able to grow earnings at a fast enough rate to maintain the stock's recent momentum. James argues that operating margins, currently at 27%, could nearly double by the end of 2030.He says that over the past decade, Netflix has managed to engineer a self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users. The streamer has already done the hard work, pouring money into creating a vast library of films and movies.""It's invested so much in its own content that it's built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,"" James says. ""When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it's over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.""Executives are targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, up from $484 billion right now. Even at Netflix's current lofty valuation, it would be all set to hit the 13-figure threshold if it could manage the necessary margin growth.The rollout of cheaper subscription plans could also help supercharge profit. Netflix unlocked a fresh revenue stream when it introduced ad-supported tiers in November 2022. Ads accounted for just 4% of revenue in 2024, but the company projects ad revenue to double this year, and its advertising president, Amy Reinhard, said Wednesday that the ad-supported tiers had added 24 million users over the past six months. James thinks the streamer will soon be able to leverage artificial intelligence to target users and make the tiers more profitable.Live sports programming could also help the streamer reach untapped markets. It might seem like every household has a Netflix account, but there's still plenty of room for the streamer to grow. For the fourth quarter of 2024, it reported 301.6 million subscribers globally. Three years ago, Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann estimated a total addressable market of between 700 million and 1 billion homes.Netflix might not even be a pure-play streamer for much longer. In February the company opened its first restaurant, Netflix Bites in Las Vegas, where fans can tuck into dishes inspired by well-known films and TV shows. It's also set to launch two experiential venues it's dubbed Netflix Houses sometime later this year.All that makes for a tempting growth story. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to rise 26% this year, another 20% in 2026, and then another 18% in 2027.Despite Netflix's stellar gains this year, investors shouldn't feel like they've missed the boat. Surging profit could quickly make the streamer look cheap again. Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for that.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515000044:0/
"Tariff News: A Trade Deal May Come This Week, Report Says — Barrons.com",1746450780000,"By Brian SwintPresident Donald Trump is hoping to pin down at least one trade deal with a country trying to lower tariffs against it before the end of the week, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified senior administration official.That would be a milestone as the deadline for higher tariffs to take effect in July approaches. Trump is looking for agreements from trading partners to buy more U.S. goods and reduce non-tariff barriers. The president has also said that the current 145% levy on Chinese imports will eventually come down.At the same time, administration officials are feeling more confident about the economic outlook, the report said. That follows a strong nonfarm payrolls report from April on Friday. Congress is this week turning its attention to a tax and spending bill that could bolster growth.Nevertheless, Trump said a downturn was still possible in a television interview on Sunday.

"These Stocks Moved the Most Today: Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Netflix, Discover, Salesforce, UnitedHealth, and More — Barrons.com",1745266860000,"By Joe Woelfel, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Connor SmithStocks fell sharply on Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 927 points on tariff jitters and concerns that President Donald Trump could try to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.On Monday, Trump called Powell a ""major loser"" and argued he was late on reducing interest rates. He also accused the Fed chief of being politically motivated.These stocks made moves:Netflix was up 1.6% after the streaming company on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of $6.61 a share, topping analysts' estimates of $5.57, and said it expects profit in the current second quarter of $7.03 a share, higher than consensus of $6.25. The company still expects revenue in 2025 of $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion, saying there has been ""no material change to our overall business outlook since our last earnings report."" Netflix posted first-quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, up 13% from a year earlier and matching expectations. The quarter was the first three-month period in which Netflix didn't disclose an updated subscriber count.UnitedHealth was down 6.3% after the giant health insurer tumbled 22% on Thursday after posting first-quarter earnings that missed analysts' expectations and slashed its full-year outlook. The stock's drop Thursday was its largest daily percentage decrease since Aug. 6, 1998, when it fell more than 28%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. UnitedHealth said it saw increased care activity in its Medicare Advantage business during the first quarter, with higher-than-expected utilization rates of physician and outpatient services.Tesla, the electric-vehicle maker, fell 6% to $227.42. Reuters reported Tesla might delay releasing a lower-priced model, which has been widely anticipated by investors for this year. The report said plans for a stripped-down version of Tesla's Model Y crossover vehicle were being delayed, with significant production planned for 2026. Tesla is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings after the closing bell Tuesday, which comes amid falling sales at the EV maker. Coming into Monday, shares have declined 40% this year.Barclays late Thursday lowered its price target on Tesla to $275 from $325 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Barclays analyst Dan Levy said he sees a ""confusing"" setup into Tesla's earnings report. The analyst believes it will be difficult for Tesla to increase deliveries in 2025.Nvidia declined 4.5% to $96.91. The leader in artificial-intelligence chips remains in the crossfire of escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. CEO Jensen Huang met Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday, following a meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing last Thursday. Nvidia shares fell 2.9% on Thursday.Amazon.com declined 3.1% to $167.32 after analysts at Raymond James lowered their rating on the stock to Outperform from Strong Buy and cut the price target on the shares to $195 from $275. The company's retail and advertising businesses could both suffer from U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, according to Raymond James.Shares of Eli Lilly fell 2.6%. The stock jumped 14% on Thursday after the pharmaceutical company said its new weight-loss pill had cleared a late-stage clinical trial. Patients on the highest dose in a Phase 3 trial lost an average of 16 pounds, or 7.9% of their weight, after 40 weeks, better than the range of 4% to 7% Lilly had indicated. CEO Dave Ricks vowed Friday that Lilly would manufacture the weight-loss pill in the U.S.Capital One Financial rose 1.5% and Discover Financial Services was up 3.5% after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it had granted conditional approval of Capital One's $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover.

Analysts at DA Davidson reduced their recommendation on shares of the cloud-based software company to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $200. Guggenheim upgraded the stock to Neutral from Sell without a price target ""as the stock has fallen to our prior price target, or a value more aligned with the company's future prospects, in our opinion,"" the analysts said.Uber declined 3.1% to $72.92 after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit accusing the company of misleading customers and failing to provide an easy way to cancel Uber One subscriptions.

Trump tariff order on movies leaves film industry flummoxed,1746449860000,"The entertainment industry reacted with alarm and bafflement on Monday after President Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., but issued few details on just how such a levy would work.Veteran studio executives who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity said the announcement on Sunday left unanswered the timing of the proposed levy and how it would be enforced for an industry whose biggest-budget films are often produced across several continents. Trump's pronouncement followed his meeting at Mar-a-Lago with his Hollywood ambassador, actor Jon Voight, special advisor Steven Paul and media executive Scott Karol. The group mulled a range of ideas to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives, tax code changes and imposing tariffs ""in certain limited circumstances,"" the group said in a statement. Slapping levies on an industry like film would mark a major extension of tariffs as a policy tool into services, for which the U.S. runs a sizable trade surplus. And like the auto , pharmaceutical and chip industries before it, Trump's declaration threatens to put another business in a tariff-induced state of limbo. The industry has been pressing for tax incentives to boost output in Los Angeles, the movie industry's glitzy historic hub of cinema, as studios have shifted production to locations such as the UK, Canada and Australia to take advantage of generous tax credits and lower labor costs. A survey among studio executives over their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 by ProdPro showed the top five choices were all elsewhere. The White House's trade policy is aimed at boosting U.S. industrial activity, but the series of levies and rollbacks has sapped consumer and business confidence.Tariffs on movies might prove particularly hard to implement.One studio executive compared movie production to auto manufacturing, with various pieces - filming, visual effects and other elements - completed around the world, then assembled, through post-production, in the U.S. Some executives wondered whether the levy would apply only to the work done elsewhere, or attach to projects jointly financed by foreign investors. Producer Todd Garner said proposed tariffs could have the unintended consequence of stymieing creativity. He cited director Steven Spielberg's acclaimed World War II epic on the invasion of Normandy, France, ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""How would you make 'Saving Private Ryan' in the U.S.? In Shreveport?"" Garner said from Australia, where he is filming the action-drama 'Runner.' ""Or a globe-trotting 'Mission: Impossible?'"" On Monday, Trump told reporters he would meet with industry officials first to make sure they liked the idea. The White House said it had not made any final decisions, but noted that Hollywood film production had sharply declined from the previous year.The primary union representing actors issued a supportive statement on Monday. SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the union supports efforts to increase domestic movie, television and streaming production and adding jobs for American workers. ""We look forward to learning more about the specifics of the plan announced by the president and to advancing a dialogue to achieve our common goals,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union representing more than 170,000 technicians and craftspeople, called for a balanced federal response that includes tax incentives to help bring jobs back. Any trade policy ""must do no harm to our Canadian members — nor the industry overall,"" said International Alliance President Matthew D. Loeb. IMPLEMENTATION CONFUSIONShares of media companies slipped on Monday. Streaming pioneer Netflix, NASDAQ:NFLX which relies on global operations to produce content for international audiences, posted a 2% decline in its stock. Disney NYSE:DIS and Universal-owner Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA edged lower. Stocks of theater operators such as Cinemark NYSE:CNK and IMAX NYSE:IMAX were down 1.6% and 2%, respectively.IMAX declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment.Entertainment attorney Stephen Weizenecker said producers, financiers and film offices were trying to figure out how tariffs would be implemented, but said it could lead to a notable shift in production back to the United States. ""If you get any sort of significant tariff, 10% or 20%, it takes away whatever production incentive there was for filming outside the United States,"" said Weizenecker, who advises producers and financiers on production incentives. However, traditional enforcement tools, like customs inspections at ports of entry, will not work for movies that are licensed, streamed or distributed on global platforms using a borderless cloud infrastructure, wrote TD Cowen media analyst Doug Creutz. The ""risks to putting digital goods and services on the table in trade negotiations/wars are overwhelmingly tilted against the U.S.,"" he noted. Hollywood brings in most of its box office revenue from overseas. In 2024, about 70% of the roughly $30 billion in global ticket sales came from outside the United States and Canada, said Daniel Loria, senior vice president at The Boxoffice Company.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RD0ND:0-trump-tariff-order-on-movies-leaves-film-industry-flummoxed/"

S&P 500 Achieves a Milestone After Two Decades - 5 Top Picks,1746447840000,"The S&P 500 Index has been able to recoup all losses suffered due to the Trump administration’s tariff-led market mayhem at a lightning speed. On May 2, the broad-market index recorded a nine-day winning streak, for the first time since November 2004. With this, Wall Street’s most observed stock index recovered all losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced the imposition of reciprocal tariffs. The index is currently around 7% away from its all-time high recorded in February. During the tariff-led April turmoil, at one point, the S&P 500 was down nearly 20% from its all-time high and was on the verge of entering the bear market zone. In addition, the index also posted two consecutive weeks of a winning run.At this stage, we recommend investing in five S&P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided more than 20% returns year to date. These are: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Newmont Corp. NEM, CenterPoint Energy Inc. CNP and Exelon Corp. EXC. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings growth potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels. NFLX reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.The primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Netflix’s policies of offering an ad-supported lower-priced tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer a high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. Philip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris has benefited from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio. PM has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, PM aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.Philip Morris is set for another year of robust growth in 2025, driven by increasing demand across all product categories.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last 30 days. Newmont Corp.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects.

Commercial production for the project is expected to commence in second-half 2025. NEM remains committed to Ghana, investing $950 million to $1,050 million in development capital for Ahafo North. Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.1% and 16.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 23.4% over the last 30 days. CenterPoint Energy Inc.CenterPoint Energy is likely to benefit from increasing electricity demand, backed by rapid electrification of transportation amid rising investments in renewable energy. CNP aims to invest substantially in upgrading its infrastructure. Successful returns from these investments should boost CNP’s long-term growth.

A stable cash flow allows EXC to pay out regular dividends. The development of data centers will increase demand. Exelon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 6.8%, respectively, for the current year.

Netflix wants to be a $1 trillion company. Earnings show why that's a reasonable goal.,1745262240000,"By Steve GelsiNetflix's stock is a rare gainer in market selloff as Pivotal Research calls the company a winner in the global streaming warNetflix Inc.'s internal goal of reaching $1 trillion in market capitalization by 2030 is reasonable, as the streaming giant is poised to benefit whether or not the U.S. heads into a recession.That was the view of Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak, one of several analysts to praise Netflix's latest quarterly earnings.Netflix's market cap currently stands at $416.2 billion, according to FactSet data.Netflix's stock (NFLX) rose 1.7% Monday in its first full day of trading since the company said late Thursday that its business is still booming and is well-protected from any economic headwinds.Netflix said it continues to expect to double its advertising revenue growth in 2025 after it launched its advertising-backed service in the U.S. on April 1, with an international ramp-up starting in the second quarter.The upward move in Netflix stock on Monday came despite steep losses in the broad equities market, as Wall Street reacted to President Donald Trump airing his complaints about Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, as well as ongoing trade policy uncertainty.Also read: Stock Market Today: Dow down over 1,200 points, S&P 500 and Nasdaq sharply lower as Trump slams Powell; dollar tumbles while gold hits recordPivotal Research's Wlodarczak reiterated a buy rating and boosted his price target on the stock by $100, to $1,350 a share.""Our view remains unchanged that Netflix has won the global streaming race as further evidenced by these results and this is what, in our opinion, winning looks like,"" he said.Netflix offers a ""very attractive"" price to value for its service, while its advertising business should deliver strong growth, he said.""Even in a global recession scenario NFLX is likely to be highly resilient,"" Wlodarczak said.Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese reiterated an outperform rating on Netflix, hiked her price target by $50 to $1,200 a share and said the stock offers investors a ""refuge from uncertainty"" due in part to a ""virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars.""By adding live events and broadening its content offerings, Netflix should be able to add more advertising revenue for the next several years, Reese wrote in a note to clients.""While massive subscriber growth was the primary driver in 2024, we expect price increases to drive revenue growth in 2025, and the ad tierto drive revenue higher in 2026,"" Reese said.Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok reiterated a market perform rating on Netflix and said the company is ""well-positioned and a macro-resistant play.""Less bullish than other analysts, Marok said Netflix stock seems to be fairly valued against high expectations.Oppenheimer's Jason Helfstein stuck to his outperform rating on Netflix's stock and boosted his price target by $50 a share, to $1,200.Netflix has reported no increase in customer defections or downgrades of plans in a sign that its move to boost U.S. prices has been well received, he said.""Despite an uncertain macro, increasing prices in France support confidence in business resilience,"" Helfstein said. ""Commentary suggests high confidence in guidance, including ads, even in a weaker macro environment as consumers value TV more during economic uncertainty.""BMO analyst Brian Pitz reiterated an outperform rating on Netflix, upped his price target by $25 a share to $1,200, and said he expects the company to generate durable advertising growth for the next few years.""Entertainment typically remains resilient during uncertain macro,"" he said. ""Management noted that, given its current positioning within the advertising industry, it provides them with 'some insulation' as the ad market appears to be weakening.""MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said Netflix offers additional profit growth potential based on the reaction to higher costs for some subscribers.""When looking at U.S. revenue per hour viewed, Netflix still appears to be underearning relative to its engagement and even after the recent price increases still has a consumer surplus to further raise prices,"" Fishman said.Some risks do remain, such as the cost of making the programming and the threat of competition, analysts said.Netflix's stock has gained 75% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX has gained 6.4%.-Steve GelsiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

3 Reasons Why Earnings Season Rocks ,1747418400000,"Imagine that, once every few months, you must release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.Sounds intimidating, right?That’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.The period is undoubtedly hectic for market participants, with companies finally revealing what’s transpired behind closed doors.And on top of being hectic, it’s impossible to understate the importance of the period. For those wondering why it’s so critical, let’s look at a few reasons that help explain its significance.1. Critical Business UpdatesEarnings reports provide market participants with a plethora of information, including revenues, expenses, and profits, just to provide a few simple examples.Take, for example, Palantir PLTR, which recently upped its current year revenue growth guidance, causing shares to soar post-earnings. PLTR has communicated that it’s been enjoying healthy demand thanks to the AI frenzy, reflected by the guidance upgrade.Analysts accordingly adjusted their current year sales expectations following the guidance upgrade, with the company now forecasted to see 35% YoY revenue growth.2. Share Price ImpactA company’s quarterly earnings report commonly impacts its stock price, a theme that market participants have undoubtedly noticed. Typically, we’ll see bullish share movement post-earnings from companies that surprise positively or raise their guidance, reflecting healthy underlying business.Netflix NFLX saw its shares soar following its latest quarterly print, with the company crushing on subscriber metrics while also posting 25% EPS growth on the back of 12% higher sales. As shown below, shares have soared following back-to-back releases.It’s worth noting that implementing a stop-loss at a comfortable threshold will help limit spooky post-earnings price swings, preserving precious capital.3. Highlights Current TrendsEarnings season can also provide a big-picture view of overall trends within the economy or industries. For a simple example, if many retail companies fall short of expectations, it could be a sign of a slowing consumer or economy, which has knock-on effects across the market.Conversely, if many retail companies report stronger-than-expected earnings, it may signal that the economy is moving along just fine, underpinned by a healthy consumer.It also allows investors to position themselves appropriately. For example, Newmont NEM, one of the world's largest producers of gold, has benefited significantly from the rise in gold, which was reflected in its latest quarterly print.The average gold price per oz reached $2,643 throughout Newmont’s latest period, melting higher from the $2,004 mark in the same period last year.

US media stocks fall as Trump threatens 100% tariff on foreign-made films,1746444974000,"American media stocks tumbled on Monday after President Donald Trump unveiled a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., a move that could sharply raise costs for Hollywood studios and rattle the global entertainment industry.Trump's announcement was short on details. It did not say whether the levies will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.Streaming pioneer Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX could particularly be at risk, analysts said, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares fell 4.9% in premarket action, leading a slide in media stocks.Despite Los Angeles' longstanding reputation as the hub of cinema, studios have over the years shifted production overseas to locations such as the UK due to attractive tax breaks and lower costs. None of the 10 best picture contenders for this year's Oscars were filmed in the Californian city.A forced move back to the U.S. would likely drive up production budgets for an industry that now relies on a global supply chain — with shoots in Europe, post-production hubs in Canada and visual effects teams spread across Southeast Asia.Walt Disney Co NYSE:DIS , Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD and Universal-owner Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA were down between 0.8% and 2.7%.""The problem is that pretty much all the studios are moving tons of production overseas to reduce production costs and leverage foreign credits,"" said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett. ""Raising the cost to produce movies could lead studios to make less content. There's also a risk of retaliatory tariffs against American content overseas."" American movies generated $22.6 billion in exports and a trade surplus of $15.3 billion in 2023, according to the American Motion Picture And Television Industry.A survey conducted by ProdPro among studio executives regarding their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 showed that the top five choices were all outside the U.S.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RD0FS:0-us-media-stocks-fall-as-trump-threatens-100-tariff-on-foreign-made-films/"
"Apple Shares Dip 21% Year to Date: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745262000000,"Apple AAPL shares have declined 21.3% year to date (YTD) underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 17.1%. The stock has suffered from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. Post the April 2 Liberation Day announcement, Apple shares had fallen 11.2% till April 9 when the 90-day pause was announced. Since then, Apple shares have recovered 3.4% to date.China is an important market for Apple as the iPhone maker’s manufacturing is primarily concentrated in the country. Higher tariffs negatively impact Apple’s China supply chain. The Trump administration’s decision to exempt electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs provided some relief to Apple. Apple has also been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone in China amid increasing competition from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. Greater China sales decreased 11.1% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.Apple Stock YTD Performance  Can Strong Services Boost Apple’s Prospects?Although Apple’s business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s strong growth driver. In the fiscal first quarter, Services revenues grew 14% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.However, Apple TV+ has been suffering from a lack of content compared to Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS. Severance , along with Ted Lasso , Slow Horses and Silo , are a few of the Apple TV+ shows that have gained fame in recent years. The number is quite small compared with content offerings from bigger rivals, including Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Apple TV+’s low popularity is hurting profitability, with the service losing more than $1 billion per The Information, which also claimed that the platform had roughly 45 million subscribers in 2024.Per the latest data from JustWatch cited by 9TO5Mac, Apple TV+’s market share in the United States has increased from 7% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 8% in the first quarter of 2025. Amazon Prime Video continued to lead with 21% market share, trailed by Netflix at 20%, Max at 13%, and Disney+ at 12%.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost iPhone Sales GrowthAlthough iPhone sales decreased 0.8% year over year to $69.14 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024. Apple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India — and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world.Apple iPhone and iPad users in the European Union can now access Apple Intelligence features. Apple Vision Pro now features Apple Intelligence in U.S. English.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 1.1% to $7.18 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 6.37% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple Inc. Stock Price and ConsensusApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.39%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Apple Stock OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.85X compared with the sector’s 23.92X, reflecting a stretched valuation.Price/Earnings Ratio (Forward 12 Months)AAPL shares are now trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Trades Below 50-day & 200-day SMAs  ConclusionAlthough the Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow, we believe Apple Intelligence’s underwhelming performance is a headwind for its product business (iPhone, iPad and Mac). Hence, we believe that Apple’s near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

"Netflix, Other Movie Stocks Fall After Trump Threatens Tariffs on Foreign-Made Films — WSJ",1746443580000,"By Caitlin McCabeShares of U.S. studios and entertainment companies dropped in premarket trading Monday, after President Trump called for a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas.- Warner Bros. Discovery stock recently stood 2.8% lower. The company is behind this year's highest-grossing film, ""A Minecraft Movie,"" which was partly filmed in New Zealand and Canada. - Netflix shares lost 3.7%. - Shares in Amazon, Walt Disney and Paramount Global all lost 1.5% or more. Amazon owns Amazon MGM Studios.It isn't clear how such tariffs would work, with Trump saying only in a social-media post that he had authorized the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to immediately begin instituting the tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.""The proclamation potentially marks a new phase of Trump's trade war, since movies aren't physical goods that move through ports.Some overseas locales, including London, have become film-making hubs, aided by tax breaks and infrastructure like large soundstages.

"Shares of Hollywood Studios, Streamers Fall After Trump's Film-Tariff Proposal",1746443160000,"By Rob CurranShares of Hollywood-studio and streaming-services owners fell after President Trump's proposal to impose hefty tariffs on movies made overseas.On Sunday, President Trump said he had authorized a 100% tariff on films produced overseas, saying he was responding to tax incentives that have lured some productions abroad.Movie executives were blindsided, and scrambled to determine the potential impact, The Wall Street Journal reported.Shares of Warner Bros Discovery, which operates the Max streaming service and HBO cable channel in addition to a major Hollywood studio, fell 2.7% to $8.31 premarket. Many major Warner Brothers releases, including recent hits such as ""Mickey 17"" and ""A Minecraft Movie,"" are produced overseas, reflecting decades-long trends in Hollywood.Shares of Netflix, which produced its recent hit series ""Adolescence"" in the U.K. and has a strong international presence, fell 5% to $1,098.50 premarket.Shares of Paramount Global, owner of the Paramount studio, fell 2% to $11.20.

Netflix vs. Paramount Global: Which Streaming Provider is a Better Buy?,1747401840000,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of entertainment streaming, Netflix NFLX and Paramount Global PARA represent two distinct approaches to capturing audience attention and market share. Netflix, the pioneer that transformed how we consume content, has evolved into a global powerhouse with more than 300 million paid households. Paramount Global, born from the merger of ViacomCBS, combines traditional media assets with streaming ambitions through Paramount+.Both companies are navigating similar challenges: intensifying competition, evolving consumer preferences, and the need to balance content investments with profitability. As streaming becomes the dominant form of entertainment consumption, investors are increasingly scrutinizing which media companies can deliver sustainable growth and returns in this new paradigm.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for NFLX StockNetflix has demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation in the first quarter of 2025, posting impressive results that highlight its dominant position in the streaming wars. Revenues grew 13% year over year to $10.5 billion, while operating income surged 27% to $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects Netflix's successful execution of its strategic priorities, which include improving content offerings and growing its advertising business.The company's content strategy continues to deliver results, with breakthrough originals like Adolescence , which became the third most popular English-language series ever with 124 million views. Netflix's international expansion is equally impressive, with significant investments in local content production across 50 countries. This global approach has paid dividends, as evidenced by the company's U.K. success, where it has captured 9% of TV viewing time, trailing only BBC and ITV.Netflix's upcoming content pipeline further strengthens its investment case. The second quarter features high-profile films like Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Straw with Taraji P. Henson and Havoc featuring Tom Hardy. The highly anticipated final season of Squid Game , Netflix's most popular series ever, debuts on Jun. 27, 2025, accompanied by updates to the related games experience, showcasing Netflix's cross-platform content monetization strategy.Netflix's financial discipline stands out as a particular strength. The company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow for the first quarter, demonstrating its ability to convert growth into tangible returns for shareholders. Management has also set ambitious but achievable targets, including doubling revenues by 2030 and achieving $9 billion in annual advertising revenues by the same year. The company's advertising business represents a significant growth opportunity, with the successful launch of Netflix's Ad Suite in the United States on April 1 and international expansion planned for this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025, creating a new revenue stream that complements its successful subscription model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.47 billion, indicating 14.01% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.33 per share, indicating 27.74% growth year over year. Netflix, Inc. Price and ConsensusNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for PARA StockParamount Global has been struggling to transform itself amid significant challenges. While the company posted revenues of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, this represented a 6% decline year over year, even when excluding the impact of the prior year's Super Bowl broadcast. The company's TV Media segment, which still accounts for the largest portion of revenues, saw a concerning 13% decrease.Despite reaching 79 million Paramount+ subscribers, the Direct-to-Consumer segment continues to operate at a loss of $109 million. Although this represents an improvement of $177 million year over year, it pales in comparison to Netflix's profitability and scale. Additionally, Paramount+ faces subscriber growth challenges, with management warning about expected subscriber declines in the second quarter due to content seasonality and the termination of an international hard bundle partnership.Paramount Global's content strategy appears unfocused compared with Netflix, spreading investments across traditional broadcast, cable networks, film, and streaming. While the company celebrates shows like Landman and 1923 , it lacks the consistent hit ratio of Netflix. The company also faces monetization challenges with Pluto TV, its free ad-supported service, where increased supply in digital video has pressured advertising revenues.The uncertain Skydance merger further complicates Paramount Global's investment case. Though management confirmed the transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2025, this pending deal creates uncertainty about future strategic direction. Questions also remain about the treatment of voting shareholders in the transaction, as highlighted by recent legal challenges from GAMCO Investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PARA’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.32 per share, indicating a 14.29% decrease year over year. The consensus estimate for 2025 revenues is pinned at $28.43 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 2.67%.Paramount Global Price and ConsensusParamount Global price-consensus-chart | Paramount Global QuoteStock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonNetflix currently trades at a premium valuation compared to Paramount Global, but the disparity appears justified given the companies' divergent financial trajectories. Netflix's price-to-earnings ratio of 43.21x reflects investors' confidence in its sustainable growth model, robust free cash flow generation, and clear path to increased profitability. In contrast, PARA's lower valuation multiple of 7.48x signals market skepticism about its ability to successfully navigate the transition to streaming.NFLX vs. PARA: P/E F12M RatioStock performance tells a similar story. Netflix shares have shown strong momentum, trading near all-time highs and significantly outperforming both the broader market and the entertainment sector. Paramount Global shares, meanwhile, have underperformed, weighed down by concerns about linear TV decline, streaming profitability challenges and transaction uncertainty.Shares of NFLX have surged 32.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming PARA and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.NFLX Outperforms PARA, Sector YTDNetflix's solid balance sheet, with $7.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, provides flexibility for content investments and shareholder returns. Paramount Global, despite generating $123 million in free cash flow in the first quarter, faces greater financial constraints and uncertainty about future capital allocation priorities.ConclusionNetflix emerges as the superior investment choice in the streaming wars based on its robust financial performance, strategic clarity, and execution capabilities. While Paramount struggles with declining legacy businesses and unprofitable streaming operations, Netflix continues to innovate and expand its dominance globally. NFLX's superior content strategy, successful advertising initiatives, and impressive cash flow generation create a compelling investment case. Investors should consider buying Netflix for its long-term growth prospects and potential for increased shareholder returns, while approaching Paramount Global with caution given its structural challenges and uncertain future. In the battle for streaming supremacy, Netflix has established itself as the safer and more promising investment bet. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas PARA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:14747e805094b:0-netflix-vs-paramount-global-which-streaming-provider-is-a-better-buy/

However, this momentum may be difficult to sustain. In the fiscal second quarter, Disney expects its Sports segment operating income to be adversely impacted by approximately $100 million due to college sports costs, including the shift of three College Football Playoff games from the previous quarter into the fiscal second quarter and one additional NFL game. Disney also guided that the fiscal second-quarter will be unfavorably impacted by a write-off of more than $50 million as a result of exiting the Venu joint venture.Our model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenues) are pegged at $10.31 billion, indicating an increase of 5.2% year over year.The Experiences segment, which includes Disney's theme parks and cruise line business, also faces challenges. For the fiscal second quarter, Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses of more than $40 million are expected to have weighed on results. For the full fiscal year, total pre-opening expenses related to Disney Cruise Line expansion are projected to reach more than $200 million. These expenses represent significant near-term costs without immediate revenue offsets.Our model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $8.93 billion, indicating 6.4% growth year over year.While Disney's streaming services appear to be gaining traction with the ESPN tile on Disney+ showing encouraging early indications and fiscal first-quarter Entertainment Direct-To-Consumer results reflecting improved profitability with nearly $300 million in operating income, continued subscriber growth remains uncertain. For the upcoming results, management expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers compared to the fiscal first quarter, suggesting ongoing challenges in maintaining subscriber momentum.The company's recent ventures into original programming for Disney+, such as the new daily sports show SC+ and the 24/7 Simpsons stream, represent strategic investments that may not yield immediate returns. Meanwhile, the recent transaction to combine Hulu+ Live TV assets with fuboTV creates additional integration complexity and execution risk.Disney's acquisition of a 70% stake in Fubo will require regulatory approvals and Fubo shareholder approval, introducing uncertainty around timing and potential regulatory hurdles. This transaction, while potentially beneficial long-term, represents one of several moving pieces in Disney's complex business transformation.From a financial perspective, Disney delivered strong consolidated first-quarter fiscal 2025 results with 44% growth in diluted earnings per share excluding certain items, 5% growth in revenues, and 31% growth in total segment operating income. However, these results might have set expectations too high for the fiscal second quarter, given the aforementioned headwinds.Looking forward, management continues to expect high-single digit adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, but achieving this target depends on successful execution across multiple fronts. Given the anticipated challenges and valuation concerns in the fiscal second quarter, investors should consider taking profits ahead of earnings and potentially re-establishing positions at more favorable entry points after gaining greater clarity on Disney's trajectory for the remainder of fiscal 2025.Price Performance & Stock ValuationShares of DIS have lost 16.9% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and peers. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix NFLX, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast CMCSA-owned Peacock and HBO Max.Year-to-Date PerformanceValuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 1.72X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s 1.39X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company’s debt balance of $45.3 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $6 billion.DIS’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched ValuationInvestment Considerations Ahead of Q2 ResultsDisney's premium valuation appears increasingly difficult to justify ahead of the fiscal second-quarter results. While the company delivered strong performance in the previous quarter, several headwinds loom on the horizon. The Sports segment faces a $100 million impact from college sports costs and an additional $50 million write-off from exiting the Venu joint venture. Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses will add another $40 million burden. Management expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers, undermining streaming momentum. The Fubo acquisition introduces regulatory uncertainty, while competition intensifies across all business segments. Despite strategic investments in original programming and platform enhancements, DIS' current valuation doesn't adequately reflect these near-term challenges. Investors should consider reducing exposure before fiscal second-quarter earnings reveal the full impact of these operational headwinds.Final ThoughtDisney's near-term outlook appears challenging despite robust fiscal first-quarter results. With anticipated Sports segment headwinds of $150 million, Cruise Line pre-opening expenses, and projected Disney+ subscriber declines, the company faces multiple operational pressures. These factors, combined with Fubo acquisition uncertainties and intensifying competition across all segments, suggest the premium valuation is increasingly difficult to justify. Investors should consider reducing positions before the fiscal second-quarter results potentially reveal the full extent of these challenges.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d3674b0e2094b:0-disney-s-q2-earnings-coming-up-time-to-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock/

"ETFs to Tap Netflix's Q1 Earnings Beat, Solid Growth Outlook",1745251920000,"Netflix NFLX reported strong first-quarter 2025 results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue estimates. It offers an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter and several analysts raised the target price on the stock, signaling bullish trends. As such, shares of Netflix jumped as much as 4.5% in after-market hours.Investors seeking to tap this opportune moment should invest in ETFs with the largest allocation to this streaming giant. These funds include MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF GGME, First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN, FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF FDND and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC.Q1 Earnings in DetailThe company reported earnings per share of $6.61, which strongly outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69 and the year-ago earnings of $5.29. Revenues rose 13% year over year to $10.54 billion and were slightly below the consensus estimate of $10.55 billion. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Netflix no longer reports quarterly subscriber numbers, following its strategy of focusing on revenues and other financial metrics as performance indicators. The company remains unscathed by the ongoing tariff chaos as the entertainment industry shows its resilience in tough economic times. Netflix's low-cost advertising-supported service plan should give it more resilience if the macroeconomic climate worsens. For the second quarter, Netflix expects revenues to grow 15% year over year to $11.04 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 44% to $7.03. The guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.96 billion for revenues and $6.22 for earnings per share.The company launched its in-house ad tech platform on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenue growth to double in 2025, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment. Netflix reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion.Strong Growth OutlookNetflix aims to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by the end of the decade, a significant leap from its current valuation of approximately $419.2 billion. The company plans to double its annual revenues from $39 billion to $80 billion, fueled by its burgeoning ad-supported subscription model and international market expansion.

Netflix May Rerate on Accelerating Ad Revenues,1747398934000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX wins bullish reviews after its ad-supported tier hit 94 million monthly active usersup more than 20 million since November and soaring from 40 million in May 2024highlighting accelerating monetization of its $7.99 ad plan versus the $17.99 ad-free entry point.Evercore's Mark Mahaney reiterated a Buy rating with a $1,150 price target following Netflix's annual Upfront Presentation, where management showcased the ad tech platform rollout and new viewership data, while noting that ad viewers now watch 41 hours/month on AVOD. BMO Capital's Brian Pitz also stuck with Buy and a $1,200 target, citing positive second-half 2025 monetization tailwinds from the upcoming Ad Suite launch in EMEA and a planned 2026 rollout of AI-powered ad formats. Seaport Research's David Joyce lifted his target to $1,230, praising Netflix's in-house ad capabilities and flexibility across formats even as subscription price hikes and membership growth continue to underpin the majority of revenue. The FT-reported upgrades reflect growing confidence that Netflix can parlay ad traction into material revenue, offsetting subscriber-growth plateaus in mature markets. Analyst commentary underscored that with advertising now accounting for a growing share of overall ARPU, Netflix may unlock a multi-year ad-revenue catalyst.

Netflix Stock Gets a Price-Target Hike. Why It Still Has Upside After a Great Run. — Barrons.com,1747394880000,"By George GloverNetflix is on a stellar run — but the video streamer's shares could still have upside thanks to their tariff resilience and new series of Stranger Things and Bridgerton.That's the view of Seaport Research Partners analyst David Joyce, who rates the red-hot tech stock at a Buy. He raised his price target to $1,230 from $1,060 Thursday — that implies shares could rise about 4.4% from their current level.Those aren't eye-popping gains, but Joyce said he sees Netflix as more of ""a core holding with limited downside"" and ""a good buy-on-the-dip candidate."" He expects the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to jump 14% to $15.24 billion between the start of this year and the end of 2026, citing a slate of new content, the success of the streamer's ad-supported tiers, and subscription price hikes.Joyce added that the stock's ""recession-resilience during the spring market turbulence"" should also boost their appeal. The stock is up about 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a broad and brutal market selloff. Investors see it as a safe haven because Netflix imports content, rather than goods. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 5% over the same period.This week, Barron's argued that Netflix stock remains a Buy despite its lofty valuation, with its margin likely to grow at a fast enough rate to maintain momentum.The streamer's own executives are also targeting further gains. They're aiming to double revenue and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter. As of Thursday's close, Netflix had a market capitalization of just over $500 billion.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Netflix's Resilient Business Model to Help Buoy 2025 Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says",1745249438000,"Netflix's NASDAQ:NFLX business is expected to be relatively resilient in a challenging economic backdrop, according to Morgan Stanley, which forecasts the streaming giant to record higher revenue for 2025 than previously estimated. The company reported its first-quarter results last week, with membership growth and price increases helping lift overall revenue above market expectations. It outlined a second-quarter revenue outlook of $11.04 billion, above Wall Street's estimates at the time, and maintained its full-year sales guidance at $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion. Netflix is tracking above the mid-point of its full-year guide, Morgan Stanley said in a client note emailed Monday. With foreign exchange now seen as a tailwind, the investment bank estimates the streaming company to report revenue of $44.45 billion for the current year, up from its previous forecast of $44.3 billion. The consensus on FactSet is for sales of $44.42 billion. In a shareholder letter last week, the streamer said its full-year revenue outlook reflected healthy member growth, higher subscription pricing and a ""rough doubling"" of advertising revenue. Morgan Stanley estimates ad revenue to cross $5 billion by 2028 from an estimated $700 million in 2024. The investment bank said that ""2025 is an important year for advertising monetization as Netflix moves from largely leveraging third parties to rolling out its own first-party advertising suite of products.""Netflix said Thursday that it increased prices in France, having recently made pricing adjustments in markets such US, the UK and Argentina. ""These increases are not driving a churn response above historical norms and remain highly revenue and profit accretive,"" the brokerage said. ""This is encouraging in the context of rising anxiety over consumer spending.""Oppenheimer said last week that Netflix has no trade exposure and could even benefit from a potential economic downturn, when consumers tend to stay home more often. Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on Netflix's stock and lifted the price target to $1,200 from $1,150. The brokerage expects Netflix to achieve a compound annual growth rate of more than 20% to 25% in per-share adjusted earnings over the next four years through margin expansion and double-digit revenue gains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250421:A3356416:0/

Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies to save 'dying' Hollywood,1746407454000,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers.""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,"" Trump said on Truth Social.Trump said he was authorizing the relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.He added: ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X: ""We're on it."" Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on how the tariffs would be implemented. It was unclear if the tariffs would apply to movies on streaming services as well as those shown in theaters, or if they would be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue. Hollywood executives were trying to sort out details on Sunday night. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the major studios, had no immediate comment. In January, Trump appointed Hollywood veterans Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson to bring Hollywood back ""bigger, better and stronger than ever before.""Movie and TV production has been exiting Hollywood for years, heading to locations with tax incentives that make filming cheaper. Governments around the world have increased credits and cash rebates to attract productions and capture a greater share of the $248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.All major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain. Shares in Disney, Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD , Paramount Global NASDAQ:PARA and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN were lower in early trade on Monday.On Monday, leaders in Australia and New Zealand responded to Trump's tariff announcement by saying they would advocate for their local industries. Some Marvel superhero movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was the backdrop for ""The Lord of the Rings"" films.The British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the government to move swiftly to protect the country's ""vital"" film industry. ""These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,"" said Bectu head Philippa Childs. She said they would also threaten tens of thousands of jobs of freelancers who make films in the UK. Film and high-end TV production in the UK was worth 5.6 billion pounds ($7.45 billion) in 2024, a 31% increase over 2023, according to the British Film Institute. The government's Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 'LOT MORE TO LOSE THAN TO GAIN'In 2023, about half of the spending by U.S. producers on movie and TV projects with budgets of more than $40 million went outside the U.S., according to research firm ProdPro. ""I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),"" said Scott Roxborough, Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter. Film and television production has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade in Hollywood's home city of Los Angeles, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region's production.The January wildfires accelerated concerns that producers may look outside Los Angeles, and that camera operators, costume designers, sound technicians and other behind-the-scenes workers may move out of town rather than try to rebuild in their neighborhoods. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most preferred place to film in the next two years, behind Toronto, Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia. Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state's tax incentives to better compete with other locations. Trump's proposed movie tariff follows a series of trade conflicts initiated by his administration, which have roiled markets and led to fears of a U.S. recession.Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump's film tariffs would be devastating.""The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,"" he said, adding it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.

Top Streaming Content Stocks to Keep an Eye on for Solid Gains,1746206220000,"An updated edition of the March 12, 2025 article.The entertainment industry has dramatically evolved over the past 20 years, shifting from conventional cable TV to the era of on-demand digital streaming. While early streaming trials appeared in the 1990s, real momentum came with YouTube’s launch in 2005 and Netflix’s rollout of its video-on-demand service in 2007.

The rise of connected devices, from gaming consoles to smart TVs, has also widened the market for streaming services. By 2029, the global video streaming market is expected to generate $190 billion annually from 2 billion paid subscriptions, according to research by Ampere Analysis. While Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) dominates, Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV (FAST) and hybrid offerings are gaining steam. Sports streaming and interactive features like live events and gaming are also driving deeper engagement.For investors, streaming stocks present a compelling opportunity, with leading companies boosting revenues through pricing adjustments, global market expansion and the growth of ad-supported models.

Warner Bros Discovery revives HBO Max branding for global push,1747236010000,"Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD is hitting rewind on Max's branding, bringing back the HBO name it dropped from the streaming service two years ago.The company will rebrand its streaming platform as HBO Max this summer, betting that the iconic brand's global reputation will drive subscriber growth as it expands internationally.The return to HBO Max also marks an ""implicit promise"" by the company to deliver unique and premium content, WBD said on Wednesday. HBO is home to some of the most popular, critically-acclaimed series including ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Detective."" ""Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead,"" CEO David Zaslav said.WBD's decision to drop HBO from HBO Max in 2023 followed its move to merge HBO dramas and top franchises like ""Harry Potter"" with lifestyle-focused content from Discovery under one service.The goal was to offer a more appealing product and to help retain viewers who typically canceled their subscriptions after watching the latest season of their favorite show.But it saw strong backlash from audiences. Even Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , called the move a surprise. ""I would have never guessed HBO would have gone away. They put all that effort into one thing that they can tell the consumer - it should be HBO,"" he said in a Variety interview in March. Streaming has become a major growth area for WBD as its cable TV business suffers from cord-cutting. Shows including ""The White Lotus"" and ""The Pitt"" helped it amass 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the January-March quarter, taking its total to 122.3 million. The company expects its subscriber base to exceed 150 million by the end of 2026. A key driver of that growth has been international expansion. After rolling out Max in over 70 countries last year, WBD plans to launch the service in the UK, Ireland, Italy and Germany.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RM1EJ:0-warner-bros-discovery-revives-hbo-max-branding-for-global-push/"
"Netflix Maintains Industry Lead as Competitors Unlikely to Catch Up, Wedbush Says",1745246738000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX has maintained a strong lead in the streaming industry with competitors unlikely to catch the company as it predicts an increase in users and subscription revenue, Wedbush said in a note to clients on Monday. The streaming service increased subscription prices in Q1 for some markets including the US, UK and Argentina with additional hikes planned for other countries, the investment firm said. The number of subscribers increased by over 41 million in 2024, and higher prices could result in an increase in future earnings estimates, Wedbush said. The company plans content investments of $18 billion in 2025, boosting movies, series, games and live events, which could provide additional growth opportunities, the analysts said. The advertising-supported subscription tier is expected to contribute to Netflix's revenue from 2026 onwards, driven by improved ad targeting and expanded content offerings. Netflix's management provided optimistic guidance for Q2, forecasting revenue of $11.04 billion and EPS of $7.03 after Q1 results exceeded street estimates, Wedbush said. The firm maintained an outperform rating and raised Netflix's price target to $1,200 from $1,150.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250421:A3356412:0/
These companies are emerging as potential winners in Trump's trade war,1746205320000,"By James RogersThis earnings season, companies in some sectors have started spelling out the potential financial impact of tariffs, while others have withdrawn their outlooks citing too much uncertaintyThe fallout from President Trump's sweeping tariffs agenda is casting a long shadow over earnings season as companies wrestle with the unfolding trade war, but there are also glimmers of opportunity amid the uncertainty, according to LPL Financial.Despite the market turmoil, names in some sectors are spelling out the financial impact of tariffs, while others have pulled their guidance, saying that the economic outlook is too uncertain. A handful of names have even cited potential benefits from the tariffs climate.Set against this backdrop, Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted opportunities in a note released this week. He categorizes this current period as ""phase one,"" characterized as ""peak uncertainty and peak tariffs,"" with ""phase two"" the period ""after the tariff dust settles.""""We believe consumer staples, real estate, and gold are well positioned for the current phase of uncertainty,"" wrote Buchbinder.He acknowledged, however, that not all consumer staples companies will be immune.Domestic packaged food companies are relatively insulated thanks to specialty crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados and chocolate falling within the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, he said. ""On the other hand, dollar stores and supercenters are not immune due to a reliance on goods from China and will be forced to raise prices or adjust supply chains after inventories are depleted,"" Buchbinder added.Related: GE Healthcare sees tariffs costing $500 million in 2025, then much less next yearBuchbinder said empty shelves are a real risk, and that imports of alcoholic beverages and spirits could be a point of pain. He also mentions the impact of cumulative price increases, ongoing sticky inflation and elevated consumer borrowing.""That said, given staples are more 'needs' than 'wants' and revenues typically hold up well in an economic slowdown, we'll put consumer staples in the phase-one winner category,"" he added.However, Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the parent of household brands including Pampers, Gillette, Crest and Tide, cut its earnings outlook last week amid worries about higher prices from tariffs and a slowing economy. Toothpaste and soap maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) also cut its guidance last week.Parts of the healthcare sector also stand to benefit from the current tariffs climate, according to LPL Financial.""It would be logical to put the defensive healthcare sector among the phase one winners, but pharmaceuticals are in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's trade policy,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""Sectoral tariffs could rattle the sector, pending successful country-level negotiations.""However, the analyst sees opportunity around medical devices. ""On the medical equipment side, tariff exposure is relatively limited, with the most exposed companies generating 12% or less of their revenue in China and most manufacturing housed in the U.S., so that group may be a phase one winner,"" he wrote.The healthcare sector has been breaking down the financial cost of tariffs in recent weeks.Medical technology company GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (GEHC) said earlier this week that the impact of the global tariffs war will cost it around $500 million at current rates and cut its full-year profit outlook. And medical-device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT) estimated recently that tariffs will cost it ""a few hundred million dollars"" this year, but reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Related: Procter & Gamble sees consumers hit 'pause' amid tariffs, job-market uncertaintyLast week, drugmaker Merck & Co. (MRK) said that its reaffirmed 2025 outlook absorbs an estimated $200 million in additional costs for already implemented tariffs. Medical-technology and drug company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) estimated that tariffs could result in about $400 million in extra costs and raised its sales outlook.Financials are also a phase-one winner because of the sector's limited exposure to goods imports, according to LPL Financial, although cyclicality also makes them a potential winner in phase two.For phase two, LPL Financial sees the communication services sector as a potential winner, with ""honorable mentions"" for technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials.In communication services, LPL Financial points to solid first-quarter results from Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX).""The key risk, beyond regulatory pressures on the big internet companies, is that tariff rates don't come down as much as we anticipate, weighing on margins in this space, although the effects on the digital media segment of the sector are quite manageable,"" Buchbinder wrote.He believes the tech sector could easily grow earnings 20% this year as AI investment continues but says that technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. ""The sector has underperformed since July of 2024,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""We also worry about semiconductor industry disruptions from U.S.-China trade tensions,"" he added, noting that this has challenged Nvidia Corp.'s performance lately.Software appears better positioned for this environment than semiconductors, according to LPL Financial. The financial services company also notes that tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) has significant operations in China that will not be cheap or quick to move away from.Related: Here's how GM is dealing with tariff uncertainty: pulling guidance, halting stock buybackMeanwhile, consumer discretionary, which sell what people ""want,"" is heavily impacted by the tariffs regime.""Tariffs on apparel makers, autos, and home construction materials (primarily lumber) are particularly biting, while policy uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence and contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending,"" wrote Buchbinder.On Thursday car giant General Motors Co. (GM) slashed its profit guidance and said that it expects tariffs to cost up to $5 billion.Elsewhere in consumer discretionary, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) kept its full-year profit outlook intact and described tariffs as ""manageable,"" while rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) cut its full-year outlook.Household products maker Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) said that tariffs could actually benefit its business and maintained much of its 2025 outlook. Consumer-facing washer and dryer maker Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) also said that it could be a ""winner"" under the new tariffs regime and kept its full-year guidance unchanged.However, airlines are a different story, with American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) pulling their guidance amid macroeconomic uncertainty.LPL Financial acknowledges that, while consumer discretionary is one of the sectors hardest hit by tariffs, it makes sense that it would benefit if levies come down.""But the uncertainty is still too high right now and a neutral stance seems prudent,"" Buchbinder wrote.-James RogersThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Following its earnings announcement, the streaming giant saw its shares jump more than 4% in after-hours trading.This was followed by a rise of 3% in premarket trading on Monday as the streaming giant's upbeat annual revenue outlook reassured investors that it could withstand any economic downturn amid a tariff-laden economic climate.The company reported first-quarter 2025 earnings of $6.61 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.17%. The figure jumped 54.8% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $10.54 billion increased 12.5% year over year or 16% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, driven primarily by membership growth and higher pricing, partially offset by F/X, net of hedging. Revenues were modestly above guidance due to slightly higher-than-forecasted subscription and ad revenues (which is still very small relative to subscription revenues). The figure missed the consensus mark marginally by 0.04%.The United States and Canada (UCAN) revenues grew 9% year over year compared with 15% in fourth-quarter 2024 due to only a partial quarter impact from the price change, plan mix and the absence of advertising revenues from the Christmas Day NFL games. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news .In a notable shift, Netflix has moved away from reporting specific subscriber counts starting with the first quarter of 2025, preferring instead to focus on financial metrics and user engagement. While tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN do not reveal subscriber figures for their respective streaming services, other media companies do. Disney ( DIS) separately breaks out Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ figures.Starting with the second quarter of 2025 results, Netflix will publish its bi-annual engagement report, which accounts for 99% of all viewing on Netflix, in tandem with second and fourth-quarter earnings results. Netflix, Inc.

In a bold move that captured investors’ attention, the company set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division, and building its advertising business. These strategic initiatives are expected to drive significant revenue and profit growth in the coming years.The ad-supported subscription tier has become a significant success story for Netflix. According to company data, more than 55% of new subscribers in markets where it’s available are choosing the ad-supported option.

9 Stocks That Are Close to New Highs Despite Market Turmoil — Barrons.com,1746120480000,"By Teresa RivasAs stocks swooned in response to the so-called Liberation Day tariff news, it seemed April would be the cruelest month, to borrow a phrase from T.S. Eliot. Yet by month's end, it was far from a wasteland.As stocks closed on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was down less than 1% compared with before President Donald Trump unveiled a 10% tariff on nearly all countries, plus higher ""reciprocal"" levies on many more. The Nasdaq Composite had eked out a gain.Nonetheless, some scars remain. On Thursday, the first trading day of May, none of the stocks in the S&P 100 opened at record levels, despite stocks making broad-based gains. Philip Morris and Netflix closed at new highs on Wednesday, but slipped back as trading began on Thursday.Nine S&P 100 stocks — Philip Morris, Netflix, Berkshire Hathaway, Duke Energy, McDonald's, Southern Company, Coca-Cola, Palantir Technologies, and Booking Holdings — were within 5% of record levels. That eclectic group reflects the market's mood last month.As a defensive name, Philip Morris shone throughout April as investors fled to safety, while also delivering upbeat quarterly results near the end of the month. The company's chief financial officer spoke with Barron's following the report, noting that Philip Morris continues to benefit from the shift away from traditional cigarettes.The story was largely the same for Coca-Cola. The consumer-staple stalwart had been doing well even before reporting a strong first quarter and noting that tariffs would be ""manageable.""Many investors felt they could do worse during times of turmoil than following in the footsteps of Warren Buffett, although Berkshire Hathaway was nearly flat in April, as was utility Duke Energy. Berkshire will report its results on Saturday, while Duke is scheduled to do so on Tuesday. Fellow utility Southern wasn't doing much on Thursday, despite reporting a better-than-expected quarter.A strong quarter was just icing on the cake for Netflix, which soared throughout April. Streaming video, the company's main business, is a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment, and Spotify is fairly well integrated into the countries where it operates. The result is that many investors believe it is insulated from the trade war and any economic slowdown it brings.McDonald's reported a disappointing first quarter on Thursday. Restaurants have been a tough space in general as nervous consumers pull back on dining out. Still, given its size and inexpensive meals, McDonald's has a somewhat defensive reputation, and was still up throughout April.In tech, Palantir wasn't only an April winner, but one of the best performers through the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency. Investors continue to buy the stock because of the potential growth of its artificial intelligence-powered software business.Booking, the online travel agency formerly known as Priceline, was up roughly 10% last month. Although investors are worried about travel demand in light of uncertainty swirling around policy, trade, and the broader economy, the company's first quarter was strong and management said demand was stable. Booking is one of the larger and more established players in the industry, so it is often seen as one of the safer bets during downturns.In short, although early April's carnage has healed to a degree because Trump has walked back some tariffs and investors are hopeful the economy will avoid the worst potential outcomes, not many stocks gained last month. Shares with decent defensive characteristics or company-specific reasons for potential gains were the exception.Here's hoping for a calmer May.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

3 Reasons Why Disney Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q2 Earnings Beat,1747139040000,"Disney DIS delivered impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues, demonstrating strong momentum across its business segments. (Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)With shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.Impressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic ExecutionDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.These results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.The Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.Direct-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share. These projections suggest steady growth ahead.(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Streaming Profitability Achieved as Content Drives GrowthAfter years of heavy investment in its streaming platforms, Disney has successfully navigated the challenging transition from traditional media to direct-to-consumer models. The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.Disney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.The company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash . These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.Disney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.Shares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+. While Netflix has returned 24.5% year to date, shares of Amazon and Apple have lost 4.9% and 15.85%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceMultiple Growth Catalysts on the HorizonLooking ahead, Disney has several compelling growth catalysts that should drive shareholder value in the coming years.In sports, ESPN delivered its most-watched second quarter in primetime ever, with viewership among the key 18-49 demographic up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by marquee events like the USA/Canada 4 Nations Championship and Women's College Basketball, which saw its most-watched regular season in 16 years.The company is preparing to launch ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, which should further strengthen its position as the preeminent digital sports platform.Meanwhile, the Experiences segment delivered strong results, with Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income growing 13% compared to the prior-year quarter. At Disney Cruise Line, the Disney Treasure is now in its second full quarter of operations, with two more cruise ships joining the fleet later this year.Most impressive is Disney's unprecedented pipeline of expansion projects around the world, creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California. This includes special celebrations for Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary and Disneyland's historic 70th anniversary.The Bottom Line: Disney Offers Compelling Value at a DiscountBased on its strong second-quarter results and improved outlook, Disney stock appears significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company currently trades at just 19.25 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings, notably below the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry average of 21.37 times. This valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a premium media brand.DIS’ 3-Year P/E TTM Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationManagement has confidently raised guidance for fiscal 2025, now expecting adjusted EPS of approximately $5.75, representing a 16% increase over fiscal 2024. The company also projects approximately $17 billion in cash provided by operations, suggesting a $2 billion increase over prior guidance. This robust cash flow enables continued investments in growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through the company's share repurchase program.ConclusionWith its streaming services now profitable, box office hits driving multi-channel revenues, significant expansion projects underway in the Parks segment, and a valuation below industry averages, Disney offers investors exposure to multiple growth vectors with increasingly solid financial fundamentals. For investors looking for a blue-chip media and entertainment company with both defensive characteristics and growth potential, DIS stock appears to be a compelling buy at current levels. Disney currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Netflix gains as rosy forecast calms investor nerves amid tariff fears,1745244011000,"Netflix shares rose about 3% on Monday after the streaming company reaffirmed its annual revenue forecast, assuring investors that it could withstand any economic downturn amid a tariff-laden economic climate.The company's co-CEO Greg Peters noted that the entertainment sector, and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX specifically, had proven resilient during previous downturns.Peters said on Thursday they had not seen any significant shifts in customer behavior, adding the company ""still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up.""The remarks offered some respite to investors who were worried that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies could likely lead to a recession, forcing consumers to rein in spending on streaming services.""Even in a global recession scenario, Netflix is likely to be highly resilient given the price-to-value of the service remains very attractive,"" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, who is five-star rated for both estimate accuracy and recommendation performance, as per LSEG data.""Their advertising business should demonstrate strong growth in any scenario given its nascent state,"" Wlodarczak added.Netflix reaffirmed its 2025 revenue forecast of between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and reported first-quarter earnings above analysts' expectations.The lower-priced, ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available, Netflix said.""2025 is an important year for advertising monetization as Netflix moves from largely leveraging third parties to rolling out its own first-party advertising suite of products,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.Even if the macro economy softens, the brokerage said it remains confident in Netflix's ability to grow average revenue per member and scale up its advertising business.At least 19 brokerages raised their price targets on Netflix's shares following the results, bringing the median target to $1,147.50.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QZ0QV:0-netflix-gains-as-rosy-forecast-calms-investor-nerves-amid-tariff-fears/"
Formula One's Long — and Successful — Race to Crack America — Journal Report,1746108000000,"By Joshua Robinson and Jonathan CleggNot so long ago — before Formula One was organizing races down the Las Vegas Strip, or in the Miami sunshine, or for half a million fans in Austin, Texas — the U.S. was the one place on earth that felt agonizingly out of reach for the world's most prestigious racing series.It wasn't for lack of trying. Ever since F1 began in 1950, organizers had brought Grand Prix races to the U.S., desperately hoping to seduce the American market that understood and embraced its traditionally oval-track motor sports, Nascar and IndyCar. But everywhere they went, the F1 traveling circus ran into a mix of misfortune, incompetence and, worst of all, indifference.In Vegas in the 1980s, F1 was relegated to racing in the parking lot of Caesars Palace. In Indianapolis, a tire fiasco led to a race featuring only six cars, instead of the planned 20. And in Phoenix, Formula One was once outdrawn by an ostrich festival held on the same weekend. To American fans, this English-driven sport might as well have been speaking a different language.""In the old times, F1 was too presumptuous,"" F1 Chief Executive Stefano Domenicali says. ""Formula One was coming to the U.S. [as if] there was nothing to explain.""Now, with F1 in its 75th season, the picture couldn't be more different. With a devoted stateside following and a genuine cultural toehold, the sport has gone far beyond simply cracking a U.S. market that former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone had all but given up on. In 2025, Formula One has put America squarely at the center of its business.A new realityThis surprising turn toward the U.S. began when the series was acquired by the Colorado-based Liberty Media in 2017 for more than $4 billion. At the time, there was only one Grand Prix a year in America, in Austin, and ratings were almost negligible.It took the sudden success of Netflix's F1 reality show, ""Drive to Survive,"" during the early part of the pandemic in 2019 to jump-start interest from U.S. audiences. In 2022, F1 added a second American Grand Prix in Miami, and the following year it launched the Vegas Strip race.Each one comes with a distinct vibe. If Austin is the closest thing to a race in the European heartland, with its petrolhead music-festival ambience, Miami was designed to be Monaco on Biscayne Bay. Vegas, meanwhile, was imagined as the over-the-top, one-of-a-kind spectacle created specifically for the ""Drive to Survive"" generation. Last season, those three Grand Prix weekends drew more than a million fans combined, on par with the most popular European races.But the sport's brass isn't letting up on its American push. Its latest crossover project, a blockbuster movie called ""F1"" starring Brad Pitt and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, will hit theaters this summer. And next year the sport will expand to admit Cadillac, backed by General Motors, as the 11th F1 team.The reason for such a concerted push on this side of the Atlantic is that in the U.S., F1 has tapped into the kind of audience that advertisers salivate over. They're young, affluent and more gender-balanced than your average sports crowd, with an average age of 35 and roughly 60% men and 40% women, F1 says.Never mind that they might not have been watching during the heyday of such F1 luminaries as Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s, or even during Lewis Hamilton's prime in the 2010s. The new fans who surfed in on the ""Drive to Survive"" wave adopted the current cast of drivers as their own and helped F1 gain unprecedented cultural relevance in the U.S.""We are feeling that explosion in the sport, of the popularity of the sport, and it's with a different generation,"" says Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll. ""They're able to follow it on their phone. They don't have to sit home at 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon or watch it on TV.""That's not necessarily ideal for a sport that hasn't entirely moved past the traditional moneymaking model of raking in cash through the sale of television rights. All of that stateside popularity has yet to turn into the American broadcast deal of F1's dreams.ESPN, which was paying exactly $0 for the rights to the series as recently as 2018, chose to walk away from its exclusive negotiation window for a new package late last year. F1, which is reportedly seeking between $150 million and $180 million a season, declined to comment on negotiations with prospective broadcast partners, but said it was confident it would secure a contract soon.Driver wantedOne thing that could change the calculus would be the arrival of an American driver.F1 hasn't had an American world champion since Mario Andretti in 1978, and no one has come close. In fact, no American has won so much as a single Grand Prix since that season. The most recent driver to give it a try was the Florida-born Logan Sargeant, whose stay in F1 lasted less than two seasons. His best race finish was 10th place.Everyone in the sport knows how much of an impact a competitive U.S. driver could have. When Schumacher dominated the series, he single-handedly revived F1 interest in his native Germany. Fernando Alonso did the same for Spain late in the first decade of the 2000s. And now that Max Verstappen is a four-time world champion, hordes of Dutch fans in orange gear are a fixture at circuits around the world.The hope in F1 circles now is that Cadillac can be the team to foster the next promising U.S. racer. But Formula One isn't waiting around for that lightning to strike. Rumors have been circulating for over a year that the sport is on the hunt for yet another American track.Email Joshua Robinson, a Wall Street Journal editor in New York, at joshua.robinson@wsj.com.

Still Time to Buy Spotify (SPOT) Stock After Q1 Earnings?,1746058980000,"Despite missing its first quarter expectations on Tuesday, Spotify SPOT stock has risen +3% since its Q1 report to over $600 a share.That said, investors may be wondering if the rally in the music streaming giant’s stock can continue with SPOT up more than +35% year to date, to largely outperform the declines among the broader indexes and even top Netflix’s NFLX +27%. Spotify’s Q1 Results Missing analysts' lofty forecast, Spotify reported Q1 EPS of $1.13 compared to expectations of $2.29 per share. Still, this was a 7% increase from earnings of $1.05 a share in Q1 2024. Spotify’s Q1 sales rose 11% year over year to $4.4 billion, although this missed estimates of $4.59 billion.Like video streaming king Netflix, Spotify’s subscription growth among its music platform has led to much hype in recent years, with it noteworthy that the company’s net subscribers spiked 12% during Q1 to 268 million. Adding 5 million new net subscribers, Spotify’s monthly active users (MAU) grew by 3 million to 678 million.Spotify’s Guidance & Outlook Providing guidance for the second quarter, Spotify expects to add 11 million MAU and 5 million subscribers. Furthermore, Spotify forecasts Q2 revenue at $4.52 billion or 10% growth, which fell in line with Zacks estimates (Current Qtr Below). Based on Zacks projections, Spotify’s total sales are expected to increase 16% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to spike another 15% in FY26 to $22.55 billion. Notably, the Sweden-based technology firm expects Q2 operating income at 539 million euros and forecasts a 31.5% gross margin.Regarding full-year margins, Spotify continues to expect improvement in 2025 at what it called a more measured pace than last year's exceptional gains as the company strategically invests to accelerate its long-term growth ambitions. SPOT EPS RevisionsSuggesting more upside in Spotify stock is that earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher over the last week. Plus, FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are now up 5% and 8% in the last 60 days, respectively.Spotify’s annual earnings are currently expected to soar 78% this year to $10.61 per share, from EPS of $5.95 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to spike another 31% to $13.95.  Bottom Line Spotify’s rapid expansion is still hard to overlook, with its stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This is largely predicated on the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions even amid its Q1 earnings miss. Correlating with such, it wouldn’t be surprising if the stellar price performance of SPOT continued.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:294f00d5c094b:0-still-time-to-buy-spotify-spot-stock-after-q1-earnings/

Top Founder-Run Company Stocks That Can Drive Solid Returns ,1746035460000,"An updated edition of the March 10, 2025, article.No one is better positioned to understand, nurture and build a company than its founder. Much like a mother devoted to raising her child, founders invest in their ventures with profound passion, unwavering vision and relentless dedication. Their appetite for risk often exceeds that of professional managers, as they willingly embrace new approaches, foster innovation and make bold choices to achieve success. As a result, these companies frequently become genuine manifestations of their founders’ core values and aspirations.However, founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Tesla, Inc . TSLA, Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (BRK.B) and Netflix NFLX. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead.As these companies are born out of a unique idea, they often involve technological innovation. These companies are built from scratch in a way that they can navigate challenges to stay sustainable over the longer term. Initially, others may not relate to a founder’s belief, making it difficult to source funds for the project. The founder often ends up putting personal wealth and savings into such bootstrap companies. If successful, they attract angel investors or raise funds. But it's always the founder-owner whose stake and risk are the highest. Moreover, a founder-owner often finds it difficult to delegate responsibilities as they are skeptical if others could do justice to the role. Thus, they often hold multiple senior/leadership positions and also face difficulties in finding a torchbearer. But one cannot be jack of all trades. Owing to their reluctance to delegate duties, these founders/owners tend to lose out on the benefits of professional expertise.Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like Netflix, Intercontinental Exchange ICE and Affirm Holdings AFRM look appealing. Ready to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

The company evolved from a small DVD rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and strong international footprint. Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. co-founded Netflix with Marc Randolph in 1997 and is the executive chairman of the company.Netflix has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping the company sustain its leading position despite the launch of services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video. NFLX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The company’s focus on streaming regional content has been leading to international growth. Netflix is diversifying its content portfolio and working on projects across India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East. The company has launched low-priced mobile plans in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Moreover, the upcoming lower-priced ad tier is expected to further drive growth in these price-sensitive regions. Netflix’s 2025 priorities include improving its core business with more series and films to offer an enhanced product experience, growth of its ads business, and newer initiatives such as live programming and games. It believes these initiatives should help it sustain healthy growth and thus projects 2025 revenues between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and an operating margin of 29%.Intercontinental Exchange, with a market capitalization of $95.6 billion, has evolved from a small start-up less than three decades ago to a company whose networks help customers manage risk, harness data and improve workflow efficiency. Jeffrey C. Sprecher, founder, chairman & CEO of ICE, stated, “These efforts saw ICE report its 19th consecutive year of record net revenues and record adjusted earnings per share, something we have achieved every year since we’ve been a public company.” Its competitive advantage lies in the digitization of fixed income workflows and automating mortgage manufacturing.With over 5,000 indices representing more than $1 trillion in benchmark assets under management, the company boasts being the second-largest fixed income provider globally. This Zacks Rank #2 company has grown over the past two decades, primarily through buyouts and collaborations that have not only fueled its growth but have also led to achieving expense synergies. Intercontinental Exchange remains well-positioned for growth on the back of accelerated digitization taking place in the U.S. residential mortgage industry to overcome several inefficiencies across the mortgage origination workflow. While the company already boasts the largest mortgage network across the United States, the integration of Ellie Mae into ICE Mortgage Technology is likely to help the company in boosting its mortgage business.A healthy and minimal risk-based balance sheet is likely to continue, providing stability and buoyancy over the medium to long term while supporting strategic investments.Affirm, with a market capitalization of $16.3 billion, a financial technology company, has emerged as a major player in the BNPL space, one of the fastest-growing segments in fintech. Affirm collaborates with merchants to integrate its pay-over-time solutions at the point of sale, boasting over 337,000 active merchant partners as of Dec. 31, 2024, across diverse sectors. Max Levchin, founder and CEO, believes “Affirm is in the strongest shape it’s ever been.”Affirm benefits from organic growth, expanding merchant partnerships, advancing technology and product innovation and expansionary measures. Technology is the backbone of a payments company like Affirm, as it powers the company’s cloud-based, data-driven platform. Affirm uses advanced machine learning and predictive models to assess fraud risk and creditworthiness and personalize services, enabling better risk assessment and pricing. Its proprietary technology, with access to data from 215 million loans, improves efficiency and scalability, creating a moat. Affirm is steadily evolving into a broader financial services platform. This diversification strategy not only expands Affirm’s addressable market but also creates new revenue streams. The company achieved GAAP profitability in the last reported quarter and aims to maintain profitability starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. This Zacks Rank #1 company is also eyeing international growth, with launches planned in Australia and Western Europe.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:16548a683094b:0-top-founder-run-company-stocks-that-can-drive-solid-returns/

"Jon Voight, Hollywood coalition asks Trump to consider tax incentives",1747086230000,"A coalition of American film industry unions and guilds, joined by veteran actor Jon Voight, has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to consider implementing tax incentives in his push to promote domestic film productions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. Along with Voight, the letter was signed by Sylvester Stallone and Teamsters union general president Sean O'Brien, among others. They call for Trump to support the inclusion of three film-friendly tax measures in a reconciliation package being drafted in Congress. Voight and Stallone were also appointed by Trump as special ambassadors to Hollywood to strengthen the industry and bring filmmaking back to the country.""Returning more production to the United States will require a national approach and broad-based policy solutions, including those we propose below as well as longer term initiatives such as implementing a federal film and television tax incentive,"" the letter read. Major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain as governments around the world introduce credits and rebates to attract film productions. Trump threw the entertainment industry into a flux earlier this month when he announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering.The move left a lot of questions unanswered, such as when the duties would be implemented and how they would be enforced — as different components of a film are made in different countries and then assembled through post-production. Trump's tariff pronouncement followed his meeting with Voight along with other executives and advisers to mull a range of ideas to to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1SD:0-jon-voight-hollywood-coalition-asks-trump-to-consider-tax-incentives/"
CEOs Are Saying These 2 Ominous Words on Earnings Calls More Than Ever — Barrons.com,1746025860000,"By Sabrina EscobarTariffs are top of mind for U.S. corporate executives, as evidenced by their comments during first-quarter earnings season, now roughly at its midpoint.The assessments of the 50 or so S&P 100 companies that had reported through Tuesday morning varied greatly, however. Some companies offered a detailed analysis of the negative impact tariffs would have, while others said they weren't yet concerned.Barron's combed through the earnings-call transcripts of these companies with the assistance of AlphaSense, and found a 132% increase in mention of ""tariffs"" in the past 90 days compared with the previous quarter, and a 20% increase in the word ""uncertainty,"" presumably resulting from the Trump administration's tariff policy, unveiled April 2.That lack of certainty is already creating shock waves through the economy by pausing business activity, shaking consumer confidence, and hampering companies' ability to make projections for the year ahead.""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years, so the only thing we're certain of is we don't know which, if any, of our scenarios will play out,"" said Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS, on a call with investors Tuesday. (""Uncertainty"" cropped up 22 times throughout the course of UPS' earnings call.)Here are seven other takeaways from earnings season so far:Economic MayhemInvestors were anxious to hear company commentary about how tariffs would affect the economy at large. Many executive teams obliged them, largely noting that higher levies would have a negative impact on the economy. Most, however, added a caveat that the effects won't be evident until the tariff levels are settled.""The simple truth today is that we don't yet know where trade policy will settle, nor do we know what the actual transmission effects will be on the real economy,"" said Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, adding that the consensus among economists is for softer growth this year.Goldman Sachs' expectation for growth in the U.S. has fallen ""meaningfully"" to 0.5% from over 2%, said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, adding that the prospect of a recession had increased.Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince had a similar message: ""The read-through of this uncertainty into both capital markets and the real economy creates elevated risks in the near- and medium-term,"" he said.All Eyes on the Consumer...Given that spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, it isn't surprising that businesses are tracking consumer activity as they make their forecasts for the year. The general gist is that consumers are hanging in there, but tariff anxiety is driving their spending.Some Americans are pulling their spending forward to try to get ahead from tariffs. Others have halted shopping altogether until they have more clarity on the tariff environment.""The consumer has been hit with a lot, and that's a lot to process. So, what we're seeing, I think, is a logical response from the consumer to pause,"" said Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten.Wealthier Americans may be an exception. American Express, which caters to higher-income consumers, said that the company isn't seeing any changes to shopping behavior.""Our card members may say they don't have any confidence in the economy, but they still continue to spend,"" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri....And BusinessesSeveral companies noted that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs is making businesses hesitant about investment decisions. That means they are delaying stocking up on inventory (or in some cases, overstocking), hiring, and dealmaking.""Everyone would like less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy, and that's what we're hearing from clients,"" Goldman Sach's Solomon said. ""They want to understand where the policy will settle out so that they can make capital decisions, investment decisions, planning decisions.""Even technology companies that derive a big chunk of their revenue from services, rather than hardware, could see a slowdown as policy settles.""In the near term, uncertainty may cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach,"" said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna. He added that the company's consulting business was also ""more susceptible"" to discretionary pullbacks and government cuts.Small and medium-size businesses could be big drivers of the pullback in spending. Many source directly from China, and while they are working with manufacturers to move to different countries, they don't have the size advantage or financial flexibility that bigger players do to diversify their supply chain, UPS's Tomé said.Creative GuidanceAll the uncertainty has made it hard for companies to make accurate projections for the year ahead, and as a result, ""S&P 500 companies have gotten creative with how they are talking about the future,"" notes Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management.PepsiCo aimed to rerate investor expectations from the get-go and lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing more volatility ahead and a subdued consumer environment. Some firms decided to do away with guidance altogether, including airlines American, Southwest, and Alaska. General Motors pulled its profit guidance for 2025, saying the prior forecast ""can't be relied upon.""Most companies, however, maintained guidance for the year. Some of these, such as science-equipment producer Danaher, said their guidance was unchanged because they believe they can completely offset the projected tariff impact. Others, like defense and aerospace giant RTX, maintained guidance but noted that tariff impacts weren't factored into their outlook for the year.3M executives reiterated its earnings guidance, but said tariffs could crimp earnings per share by anywhere from 20 cents to 40 cents a share, barring any mitigation strategies.Even in the midst of the chaos, there were still a few guidance raises. AbbVie tweaked its adjusted earnings per share guidance higher — but it doesn't reflect any shifts in trade policy, including the potential for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs.""It's premature to speculate on the impact, and once we have that information, we'll communicate at the appropriate time,"" said AbbVie CEO Robert Michael. Other healthcare also companies refrained from making sweeping guidance changes until the sector's tariffs are completed.Mitigation, Mitigation, MitigationCompanies are pursuing a host of initiatives to soften the tariff blow. The main efforts are tied to shuffling about supply chains, including diversifying countries of origin and sourcing products in the U.S.Firms are also negotiating with vendors to try to share the burden of higher import costs, and trimming costs across the business to redirect toward the import tax. Hasbro, for instance, said it was accelerating its cost-cutting program and is now aiming to save $175 million to $225 million this year.If all else fails, most will resort to an age-tested solution: raising prices.The problem — as Colgate-Palmolive CEO Noel Wallace explained — is that if consumer demand falls, companies will have less wiggle room to hike prices.""The pricing environment will continue to be challenging, I think, in terms of where things go now,"" Wallace said. ""As tariffs take hold, I think everyone will be looking for ways to create value in the category that will be principally driven, in my view, through innovation. But there will be some pricing that will have to take place in certain markets around the world.""Business-facing enterprises may have more flexibility to increase prices than consumer-facing ones.All Good HereWhile most companies were bracing investors for the havoc that accompanies higher tariffs, a lucky few indicated they weren't too concerned about the levies.Telecommunications firms, for instance, felt confident that consumers weren't going to shut down their phone lines, and that they would be able to pass on any phone price increases to the consumer.""Whenever I get asked about the economy, my first answer is we're not really the people to ask,"" said Mike Sievert, CEO at T-Mobile. ""I mean, we're probably the least canary in your coal mine because people feel so strongly about this category that we'll find a way to keep paying their bills.""Netflix's executive team struck a confident tone as well, noting that home entertainment becomes ""really important"" to households in tougher economies.Renewable energy provider NextEra Energy estimates that tariffs will affect capital spend for its energy resource segment by less than 0.2%, which could even be negotiated down to zero.""When I think about where we stand, I feel very good about tariffs. It's just not going to have much of an impact at all on our business,"" said CEO John Ketchum.We're Talking to TrumpSome companies sought to reassure investors that they were engaging with the administration to eke out the best deal for the industry.""I don't think a day goes by where we aren't engaged with someone in the administration, including cabinet secretaries and up to POTUS himself,"" said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg.""So we're spending a lot of time making sure the administration understands the implications of either short-term or long-term tariffs on not just our company, but the overall aviation industry here in the U.S.,"" he added.That said, firms are toeing a fine line between advocating for softer tariffs, and staying on the president's good side.""We have been, I think, full-throated in our support of the administration's efforts to support American competitiveness and revitalize American manufacturing. We're well-aligned in that regard,"" said GE Aerospace CEO Lawrence Culp. ""But it's easy to overlook the $75 billion trade surplus the sector enjoys largely on the back of this tariff-free regime that we've had since 1979. So, all we have suggested, as the administration works through a myriad of issues, is that they consider the position of strength that the country enjoys as a result of this tariff-free regime and to consider re-establishing the same.""Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla to Debut Self-Driving Taxi in June as Robotaxi Wars Begin,1747080000000,"Disrupt or be DisruptedTechnological advances are always at the heart of disruption on Wall Street, and thus, the most profitable long-term trend opportunities. However, it will mean a slow, painful death for companies who fail to adapt and evolve. Conversely, the rewards are substantial for companies that respond to market changes and debut new technologies. For instance, Blockbuster Video did little to adapt when Netflix ( NFLX ) first began its mail-order DVD service (which later morphed into a streaming service). The result? Blockbuster went bust, and Netflix would become one of the best-performing stocks of the 2000s.Why Robotaxis are Taking OverOver the past few months, the idea of autonomous vehicles has gone from dream to reality. Advancements in artificial intelligence, software, cameras, and sensors have made this possible. Robotaxis provide several benefits, including:- Safety: Drive on the road for more than a half hour in any major US city and you are likely to witness at least one driver glancing down at their Apple ( AAPL ) Pphone. Robotaxis promise to reduce human error and distraction, reducing the number of accidents. - Cost Reduction: By eliminating the need for human drivers, ride-hailing operators can become far more profitable. - More Vehicles: Because robotaxis don’t need to take breaks like humans (outside of recharging), they can run nearly 24/7, increasing the number of vehicles on the road, improving customer wait times while increasing profitability.The Robotaxi Wars are HereThus far, Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) “Waymo” service is the undisputed king of robotaxis. Waymo is the first major robotaxi player to gain regulatory clearance, operates in four US cities (with plans to add two more), and its paid robotaxi business has exploded to more than 250,000 paid rides per week. Meanwhile, Waymo has inked a strategic partnership with Uber Technologies ( UBER ), operator of the most-extensive ride-sharing application and network.Tesla Will Enter the Robotaxi Market in JuneWhile Tesla ( TSLA ) and its visionary CEO Elon Musk, are behind in the robotaxi wars, the race to robotaxi supremacy is in the early innings. Musk has said several times over that past few years that he is “betting the company” on autonomous vehicle technology and believes that robotaxis will revolutionize transportation and potentially increase the value of a Tesla by fivefold. Though Tesla’s robotaxi debut has been delayed several times, Tesla has finally begun testing its robotaxi service with employees in Austin, Texas. Next month, Tesla will start to roll out its robotaxi to customers through its in-house built mobile application.Waymo vs. Tesla: Who Will Win the Robotaxi War? Waymo has an early advantage in the robotaxi war. While Tesla has yet to launch, Waymo is a proven entity that is well on its way to reaching scale. That said, it is far too early to count Tesla out. A critical difference between Waymo and Tesla robotaxis is cost. Waymo autonomous vehicles are far more expensive than Tesla robotaxis. Because Waymo leverages expensive LiDAR, radar, cameras, and AI, it can cost about $180,000! Conversely, Tesla robotaxis will only rely on computer vision AI, costing about $50,000 to produce.Image Source: @teslaownersvIn other words, while Tesla is behind in the robotaxi race, its lower cost could allow it to catch up in scale and also enjoy jucier profit margins in the long run.Bottom LineWhile Waymo currently holds a significant lead, Tesla’s impending entry (with game-changing cost advantage) injects uncertainty into the future landscape of autonomous transportation. It means the robotaxi wars may just be starting.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:aba92c91b094b:0-tesla-to-debut-self-driving-taxi-in-june-as-robotaxi-wars-begin/
The Trade Desk vs. Magnite: Which Ad Tech Stock is the Smarter Buy?,1746025560000,"The Trade Desk, Inc. TTD and Magnite, Inc. MGNI are players in the digital advertising technology space. TTD operates a leading demand-side platform, which aids advertisers in focusing on data-driven advertising. Magnite is a supply-side platform (SSP) that helps publishers manage and sell their ad inventory across various formats like streaming, online video, display and audio. Digital advertising spend is expected to be driven by increasing mobile penetration, social media platforms, and programmatic advertising. Per a report from Grand View Research, the global digital advertising market is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030. The report further added that digital advertising will continue to be dominated by video as brands understand the effectiveness of visual storytelling.This uptrend in spending benefits both TTD and MGNI. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in digital advertising, which stock stands out?Let us delve a little deeper into the companies’ strengths and weaknesses to see which is the better stock pick.The Case for TTDTTD is benefiting from a significant increase in digital spending in key areas, such as Connected TV (CTV) and retail media. In the fourth quarter of 2024, The Trade Desk reported a record-breaking spend of more than $12 billion on its platform, signaling continued growth in advertiser demand. The Trade Desk also introduced its Ventura Operating System for CTV, designed to drive greater efficiency and transparency in CTV advertising. This operating system enables better data management, allowing TTD to enhance its targeting capabilities, which are crucial as the CTV market expands.The acquisition of Sincera, a leading digital advertising data company, will aid in enhancing its programmatic advertising platform by integrating Sincera’s actionable insights on data quality. The Trade Desk is actively simplifying its platform to be more intuitive without compromising sophistication, which should improve client onboarding and retention. At the same time, the company is aggressively integrating AI across all its operations to cater to the evolving needs of its clients amid the AI boom. While Kokai is expected to replace Solimar entirely by the end of 2025, TTD currently maintains two platforms, leading to operational difficulties. Any delays in Kokai adoption could impact performance and reduce upsell opportunities. Despite strong demand for its ad-buying platform, the company faced challenges from shifting market conditions and competitive pressures. Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions do not augur well for TTD, as these could squeeze ad budgets. The intensely competitive nature of the digital advertising industry, dominated by industry giants like Google and Amazon continues to put pressure on TTD’s market positioning.The Case for MGNIMagnite is gaining from robust growth in CTV, with contributions excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (ex-TAC) from CTV increasing 19% year over year for 2024. For the full year, it generated contribution ex-TAC of $607 million and processed ad spend of over $6 billion. The growth is being driven by increased ad spend and programmatic adoption by leading giants like Walmart, Disney, Fox, Roku, LG, Vizio, Warner, Discovery, and Paramount. On the last earnings call, MGNI highlighted Netflix ’s NFLX ad ramp as a significant business opportunity. Netflix is focused on expanding its global ad tier and corresponding ad revenues. MGNI expects Netflix to be a key programmatic partner as they boost the rollout of their ad platform in 2025. Given the momentum, MGNI expects contribution ex-TAC growth of over 10% or mid-teens (excluding political) in 2025. Strong growth in Live sports is another tailwind. Its expanded deal with Disney now includes live sports, international markets and podcasts, with Disney inventory also integrated into ClearLine. It is also bolstering its international sports business by expanding its partner base with additions of new partners like FIFA and Sky New Zealand. The addition of more generative AI-powered tools in 2025 is expected to expected to drive operational efficiencies and enable new monetization opportunities. MGNI’s SpringServe ad server and streaming SSP platform are its main catalysts. As MGNI does not resell inventory, its technology has enabled direct relationships with virtually all major streaming platforms except YouTube, allowing reach to 92 million U.S. and 75 million EMEA households. Moreover, ClearLine and SpringServe are driving MGNI’s agency marketplaces, which are used by firms like GroupM and Horizon. These marketplaces enable end-to-end solutions and more efficient media spend for these agencies. These tools are strategically important for MGNI, creating sticky relationships with agencies and advertisers. The company’s tech stack initiatives have helped it reduce costs per ad request in 2024. For DV+, the costs per ad have reduced by 26%, and for CTV, it has come down by 45%. However, as with all firms operating in this space, competitive pressure, especially from tech behemoths, is enormous, along with macroeconomic uncertainty that could threaten ad budgets. Also, MGNI’s DV+ (display, video, and mobile) business underperformed in the fourth quarter of 2024, mainly due to a post-election unusual spending patterns. Though MGNI added that the business has rebounded across verticals, the volatility can be a concern. Also, its heavy reliance on CTV business increases business risk. Higher expenses could weigh down on profitability. Share Performance for TTD & MGNIBoth TTD and MGNI shares have suffered from tech sell-off due to the escalating trade war situation. Over the past three months, MGNI has lost 28.5% while TTD’s decline stands at a staggering 54%. Valuation for TTD & MGNIValuation-wise, TTD is overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F, while MGNI has a Value Score of B, respectively. In terms of the forward 12-month price/earnings ratio, TTD shares are trading at 28.37X, higher than MGNI’s 12.83X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for TTD & MGNI?Analysts have significantly revised their earnings estimates downward for TTD’s bottom line.While for MGNI, there is no revision. TTD or MGNI: Which is a Smarter Pick?Currently, MGNI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick compared with TTD, which has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Magnite stands out as the smarter pick due to its stronger valuation, diversified partnerships, and expanding CTV footprint with clients like Netflix and Disney. If investors are seeking an AI tech stock with long-term growth potential, MGNI is a better pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:95bc78dd4094b:0-the-trade-desk-vs-magnite-which-ad-tech-stock-is-the-smarter-buy/

Buy 5 Stocks That Have Survived April's Tariff-Led Market Mayhem,1745928720000,"Wall Street has seen severe volatility in April owing to the imposition of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade-related policies. With just two days of trading left, most of the major stock indexes are trading in negative territory month to date. A large section of economists and financial researchers have warned of a near-term recession too. Trade-related negotiations are ongoing between the Trump administration and several other important nations. Stock prices of a long list of corporate behemoths have tumbled in April. Although we are not out of the woods so far, a sliver line is visible.A handful of corporate bigwigs (market capital > $50 billion) have survived April’s Wall Street turmoil. Stock prices of these companies have provided positive returns (> 5%) month to date. We recommend five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.These are: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Newmont Corp. NEM, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. AEM and Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last seven days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Netflix Inc.Netflix handsomely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for bottom line while the top line was mostly in line with the consensus mark in first-quarter 2025. Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels. NFLX reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.The primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Netflix’s policies of offering ad-supported lower-prices tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 27.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.8% over the last seven days. Newmont Corp.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. NEM is likely to gain from several projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest also created an industry-leading portfolio and provided opportunities for significant synergies. NEM also remains focused on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders.Newmont has received full funds approval for its Ahafo North project and the project has reached the execution stage. Commercial production for the project is expected to commence in second-half 2025. NEM remains committed to Ghana, investing $950 million to $1,050 million in development capital for Ahafo North. Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.9% and 16.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last seven days. Philip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris has benefited from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio. PM has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, PM aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.Philip Morris is set for another year of robust growth in 2025, driven by increasing demand across all product categories. PM anticipates positive volume growth for the fifth consecutive year, with an expected increase of 2%. Smoke-free products remain a key growth driver, projected to expand by 12-14%, reinforcing PM’s strategic shift toward reduced-risk alternatives.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last seven days. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd.Agnico Eagle Mines is focused on executing projects that are expected to provide additional production growth. The Kittila expansion promises cost savings, while acquisitions like Hope Bay and the merger with Kirkland Lake Gold strengthen its market position. Merger with Kirkland Lake Gold established the new AEM as the industry's highest-quality senior gold producer. Higher gold prices are also expected to drive AEM’s margins. AEM’s strategic diversification mitigates risks, supported by prudent debt management and maintaining financial flexibility.Agnico Eagle Mines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.9% and 33.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.8% over the last seven days. Spotify Technology Spotify Technology provides audio streaming services worldwide. SPOT operates through two segments — Premium and Ad-Supported. The Premium segment offers unlimited online and offline streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts without commercial breaks to its subscribers. The Ad-Supported segment provides on-demand online access to its catalog of music and unlimited online access to the catalog of podcasts to its subscribers on their computers, tablets, and compatible mobile devices. SPOT also offers sales, distribution and marketing, contract research and development, and customer support services.In the last reported quarter, total Monthly Active Users (MAUs) were 675 million versus the consensus estimate of 665.25 million. Ad-Supported MAUs were 425 million against the consensus estimate of 420.15 million. Premium Subscribers came in at 263 million compared to the consensus estimate of 259.99 million.Spotify Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.8% and 75.8%, respectively, for the current year.

Netflix Is Maintained at Overweight by JP Morgan,1745240820000,(13:07 GMT) Netflix Price Target Raised to $1150.00/Share From $1025.00 by JP Morgan,https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250421002341:0/
"Fox names new streaming service 'Fox One', plans launch before football season",1747052048000,"Fox Corp NASDAQ:FOX said its new subscription-based streaming service will be called ""Fox One"" and is set to launch before the fall American football season as the company seeks to reach audiences beyond its mainstay cable television business.Unveiling details on Monday about the service first announced in February, Fox said pricing for ""Fox One"" would align with its wholesale rates and would not be at a discount.Shares of the company rose 5% as it also surpassed quarterly revenue expectations, thanks to a surge in advertising sales driven by its broadcast of ""Super Bowl LIX"" in February.The Murdoch family-controlled company has largely sat out the streaming race, betting instead on ad revenue from its free Tubi streaming service that has about 97 million monthly active users.Fox will partner with other distributors and services to offer Fox One, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, hinting at potential bundling deals with other streamers — a strategy that has gained traction as companies look to curb subscriber churn.""The pricing will be healthy,"" Murdoch said.Launching the service ahead of the NFL season should drive good initial uptake, regardless of price, said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. But he flagged doubts about how many streaming services the market could sustain.In the March quarter, more advertisers turned to the owner of FOX News, FOX Sports and Tubi to tap its growing viewership. An estimated 127.7 million viewers tuned in for the Super Bowl championship broadcast by Fox, the largest audience in TV history for a single-network telecast. Revenue rose 27% to $4.37 billion in the third quarter, beating an estimate of $4.18 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Advertising revenue surged 65%.

New Tariffs Hit Film Industry—What It Means for Netflix,1747048500000,"There are no clear-cut answers in today’s uncertain stock market, as President Trump's recently rolled-out trade tariffs start to hit industries that weren’t considered targets for these trading headwinds. When the announcements started, the attention seemed to be centered on the  technology sector , specifically the semiconductor and chipmaking industry in Asian regions. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] However, these tariffs quickly spilled over into the retail sector and, most recently, into entertainment . As some countries have made little effort to work around a deal with the United States, President Trump has come up with more creative ways to force the market into negotiations, with his latest strategic round of tariffs focused on the movie industry . After announcing a 100% tariff on foreign-made films , all eyes suddenly turned to one stock.Shares of Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on a tear for the entire year, as investors believe that this subscription business could outweigh the volatility brought on by trade tariffs due to its fundamental strengths and the ability of management and analysts to forecast earnings and revenues into the future, aiding in better outlooks and valuations in the future. Here are some angles investors can consider for Netflix on this new development.Price Action: Netflix’s Latest SeriesOver the past 12 months, Netflix's stock delivered a massive 88.8% rally to outperform most of its peers and the broader S&P 500 . This reiterates the fact that as volatility and uncertainty hit the broader financial markets, Netflix was able to attract the attention and preference of investors due to its value proposition .However, over the past week, Netflix stock declined by as much as 4% on the news of these 100% movie tariffs . Even with this adverse reaction initially, there are a few things to consider for the future of the stock that might create more stability and positive outlooks in the coming months and quarters.Costs should be kept front and center when strategizing the potential scenarios that might come from these 100% tariffs, but here’s where the broader market participants think the stock could go next. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:NFLX] Institutions Are Okay With Uncertainty; Here’s WhyEven as Netflix's costs are set to rise , since a growing share of series and movies are produced internationally, not to mention a growing base of foreign users, there seems to be one clear advantage that Netflix can implement in the face of this new situation it has found itself in.With such a massive presence in the entertainment industry, not to mention its large market share and growing footprint across the globe , Netflix has a few ways to get around these new tariffs. One of the first, but not so obvious, is that Netflix can simply insource production in the United States for foreign creators to avoid some of these tariffs.Doing this would absolutely help the company in two ways. First, it can offset some of the significant added costs associated with importing foreign films. Second, it can gain political goodwill by bringing more production and exposure to the American scenery. This would mean added investment in the country , which might bring on potential grants and credits . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] That one can be a little complicated because it rests on many assumptions and multiple-choice options for the company and other producers. A more straightforward strategy might come from the brand’s leverage and pricing power , avoiding some of the hoops that need to be jumped through to onshore production and further logistics.This simpler alternative is to  raise prices , which might be seen as negative at first because the initial assumption is that higher prices will lower future demand. However, when investors zoom out, it isn’t just Netflix that has this problem; it is pretty much all the others in the entertainment industry .Knowing this, it becomes a race to see who is first to raise prices and lock in the additional audience before everyone else is either forced to take on the logistical onshoring or raise prices to avoid such heavy lifting. With both scenarios pointing to a Netflix win , it’s no surprise that some of the largest institutions warm up to owning more Netflix stock.Such as those from Natixis Advisors , who decided to boost their holdings in Netflix stock by 1% as of May 2025. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, it did bring the group’s net position to a high of $520.4 million today , giving investors another sign of confidence in the future , one that might be filled with one of these two assumptions moving forward.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:e3d26e2e5094b:0-new-tariffs-hit-film-industry-what-it-means-for-netflix/

He expects advertising revenue to double in 2025, fueled by higher user engagement and flexible pricing.Netflix also aims to expand its ad-tech capabilities across 10 remaining markets, a move analysts say could attract more large-scale advertisers. Additional gains may come from small and medium-sized businesses as Netflix enhances targeting tools with AI integration by 2026.TD Cowen's John Blackledge also reiterated a Buy rating with a $1,150 price target, citing strong quarterly performance and confidence in Netflix's full-year outlook.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:c6b49cd7d094b:0-top-analysts-see-more-upside-in-netflix-after-strong-q1-earnings/
Tariff uncertainty clouds outlook for US television's annual ad-selling bonanza,1747044000000,"The risk of a tariff-induced U.S. recession is hanging over the television industry's annual upfront selling season, when companies stage star-studded pitches to coax brands to commit to spending billions of dollars on advertising in the year ahead. Starting Monday, the presentations in New York kick off weeks of negotiations in which television networks and streaming services typically lock in the largest share of their ad revenue for the year. YouTube NASDAQ:GOOG promises a performance by Lady Gaga and an appearance from one of its biggest stars, Mr. Beast. NBCUniversal will host its presentation at Radio City Music Hall and Warner Bros. Discovery NASDAQ:WBD at Madison Square Garden.But the champagne-fueled parties will take place against a backdrop of economic concerns, stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies, which economists warn may lead to a recession. While major media companies have not reported any decline in ad demand, industry analysts predict brands will reduce their spending as consumer confidence wanes.Research firm eMarketer projects ad spending on traditional television during the upfronts could fall to $13.4 billion, down $4 billion from last year, depending on the level of tariffs that take effect. The Trump administration is negotiating deals with a number of major trading partners, including China.For digital ads on online devices, the worst-case scenario is that spending will stay flat at around $13 billion, eMarketer said. If tariffs are limited, digital ads could rise to $14.7 billion.Data firm Guideline said a pullback was already evident. Ad spending rose 7% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2024, but future bookings suggest growth could decelerate to 3% in the second quarter, Guideline said. Media executives acknowledged some brands might feel nervous, but said there could be a cost to cutting ad spending.""Clients learned some important lessons during COVID, when a lot of advertisers pulled back very quickly and then had to redeploy those funds,"" said Jeff Collins, president of advertising sales, marketing and brand partnerships at Fox NASDAQ:FOX . ""And I think that they're trying not to have a knee-jerk reaction to what is happening now.""Advertisers that wait to purchase time at the last minute in the so-called ""scatter"" market sometimes pay double-digit percentage increases in rates, Collins said.Fox had not yet seen any impact on ad demand from tariffs, he added. Karen Kovacs, president of advertising sales and partnerships at NBCUniversal, said brands that continued to spend on advertising during past downturns maintained better sales and market share than others that cut back. NBCU parent Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA , in its latest earnings report, said ad revenue was roughly flat during the first three months of 2025. BUYER'S MARKETSellers of ad time may need to give concessions on pricing and cancellation terms to win business, said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes, adding tariffs would have most impact on the advertising of physical products like cars and consumer goods.Digital players like Google's YouTube or Facebook parent Meta NASDAQ:META will likely emphasize the use of artificial intelligence to help brands reach customers more efficiently, said Greg Kahn, CEO of GK Digital Ventures media advisory firm.Many U.S. companies have cut or withdrawn their annual forecasts, citing an uncertain trade environment, including General Motors NYSE:GM , Kraft Heinz NASDAQ:KHC and bleach maker Clorox NYSE:CLX .Clorox is evaluating how much it spends on advertising, CEO Linda Rendle said on an earnings call last week.""We're going to continue to invest strongly in our brands, but at what level makes the most amount of sense given the returns that we're getting,"" Rendle said. Still, some media firms remain upbeat.Disney NYSE:DIS expects annual advertising growth to surpass its previous 3% forecast, while Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX co-CEO Greg Peters said in April the company was not seeing any signs of softness in its pre-upfronts discussions.The company does not disclose ad revenue, but analysts polled by LSEG project Netflix will bring in $2.7 billion from advertising in 2025. Netflix launched its ad-supported options in November 2022 and is still in the early stages of building that business. ""That smallness probably provides us some insulation to market shifts right now,"" Peters said, adding that Netflix expects to double ad revenue this year.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3R116L:0-tariff-uncertainty-clouds-outlook-for-us-television-s-annual-ad-selling-bonanza/"
Netflix's Ted Sarandos Says Cinemas Are Fading as Viewers Stay Home,1745869671000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) co-CEO Ted Sarandos said traditional moviegoing is falling out of favor as more people choose to watch films at home. Speaking at the 2025 TIME100 Summit in New York, Sarandos said Netflix is saving Hollywood by keeping audiences engaged with new content that might otherwise disappear.Sarandos said falling box office numbers show that consumers want flexibility, and Netflix meets that demand by letting people watch when and where they want. While he acknowledged some still enjoy the communal cinema experience, he called it an outmoded idea for most.He credited Netflix with making audiences more open to different genres, pointing to a recent event where a live chamber music performance celebrated the streaming hit Bridgerton .Sarandos also said the entertainment industry often gets sidelined in global trade deals, where companies like Netflix face stricter rules than other sectors. He argued entertainment should be treated like any other serious business.He warned that U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump, particularly tariffs, could shrink the international reach of American films and shows. His comments come as Chinas film regulator announced plans to limit the number of U.S. films shown in the country, citing American tariffs and warning of declining public support for U.S. entertainment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6b5d2d6b9094b:0-netflix-s-ted-sarandos-says-cinemas-are-fading-as-viewers-stay-home/
Netflix Wins Praise From Top Analyst for AI-Powered TV Interface Overhaul,1746813995000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX drew investor attention Friday after a well-known analyst backed the streaming platform's redesign of its TV interface, calling it a potential driver of stronger engagement and revenue.The platform's upgraded TV app now offers real-time, personalized recommendations based on a user's viewing and search habits.

"Roku Gears Up to Report Q1 Earnings: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745850840000,"Roku ROKU is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 1.For the first quarter of 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $1.005 billion, indicating an increase of 14% year over year. The company anticipates Platform revenues to grow 16% year over year, and Devices revenues are expected to remain flat year over year due to elevated inventory from lower holiday sales. It expects first-quarter total gross profit of $450 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13.96%.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Shaping Upcoming Results of RokuAs Roku prepares to report first-quarter 2025 earnings, investors should maintain a cautious stance. Despite strong Platform momentum in 2024, Devices revenues and gross profit were impacted by increased seasonal discounting across the industry, including at Roku. This resulted in an excess inventory position at the end of 2024, which is expected to have weighed slightly on gross margins in the first quarter of 2025.Platform growth remains healthy, with management estimating 16% year-over-year growth for the first quarter of 2025. Streaming services distribution and advertising activities both contributed to the expected increase, with advertising activities anticipated to grow faster than subscription revenues. However, the absence of political advertising spend compared to the fourth quarter, along with seasonal trends, might have tempered advertising momentum in the quarter under review.The Roku Channel continues to expand rapidly, reaching approximately 145 million people in the United States and delivering 82% year-over-year growth in Streaming Hours during the fourth quarter. Enhancements to the Roku Experience, including an AI-powered content row and expanded ad formats, such as Brand Showcases and Action Ads, are driving increased engagement and monetization. Nevertheless, macroeconomic uncertainty and competitive shifts in the ad market may present near-term volatility.Roku operates in an increasingly competitive advertising landscape, facing new pressures in the first quarter of 2025 as companies like Netflix NFLX, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, and Disney DIS expand their ad-supported streaming offerings. The global reach, brand strength, and established advertiser relationships of these companies may have challenged Roku’s ability to capture ad budgets and sustain advertising momentum during the quarter under review.Roku’s international expansion into markets like Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom is expected to have driven user growth in the first quarter of 2025. However, as the company remains focused on scaling its international presence before prioritizing monetization, the immediate impact on revenues is expected to have been limited.Top-Line Growth Estimates for Q1The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average revenue per user is pegged at $42.09. The consensus mark for first-quarter 2025 Devices revenues is pegged at $127 million, and for Platform revenues, it is pinned at $877 million.ROKU Price Performance & Stock ValuationShares of Roku have lost 11.6% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 index’s decline of 4.9% and 6.4%, respectively.ROKU’s YTD Price PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, Roku currently trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 43.86X, which is at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 31.54X. While this valuation gap suggests that investors have high growth expectations for this stock, it is not a good pick for a value investor. A value score of D further reinforces an unattractive valuation for ROKU at this moment. Price-to-Cash Flow RatioInvestment ConsiderationsRoku continues to demonstrate strong platform fundamentals with robust user engagement, innovative Home Screen monetization, and healthy international expansion. However, investors should adopt a cautious stance ahead of first-quarter 2025 results. Elevated inventory levels and margin pressures from seasonal discounting in Devices, combined with intensifying competition in ad-supported streaming, may weigh on near-term performance. While Platform revenues are poised for double-digit growth and advertising activities remain a key strength, given Roku’s premium valuations and potential volatility in advertising trends, patience could reward investors seeking a more attractive entry point.ConclusionRoku’s platform growth trajectory remains healthy, but current valuations largely reflect its projected growth. With first-quarter gross margins pressured by excess holiday inventory, seasonal advertising trends normalizing, and competitive intensity rising in ad-supported streaming, investors should consider maintaining existing positions while awaiting a more favorable entry point. The company's innovations in Home Screen monetization and international expansion offer long-term upside, but prudent investors may benefit from patience ahead of first-quarter results.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6e3d95f2e094b:0-roku-gears-up-to-report-q1-earnings-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock/

Scroll down and you'll see rows like Your Next Watch or Only on Netflix, all based on what you've seen, searched, or even which trailers you've clicked.Content tiles are getting labels like Emmy Award Winner or Recently Added to give users more context before hitting play.

Tech Sizzled Last Week: Top-Performing ETFs in the Sector,1745841600000,"Wall Street was charged-up last week, thanks to the tech rally . The major averages rose last week, recording their second positive week out of three. The S&P 500 gained 4.6%, the Dow Jones added 2.5%, the Nasdaq jumped 6.7% and the Russell 2000 advanced 4.1% last week (as of April 25, 2025).Despite this week's rally, April has been mixed overall. The Nasdaq is now slightly positive for the month, but the S&P 500 remains down 1.5% month to date, and the Dow has fallen 4.5%.Tech Giants Lead the RallyBig tech stocks were a major catalyst on April 25. Alphabet GOOGL gained 1.7% after the Google parent reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on both revenues and profits. Tesla TSLA surged 9.8%, while NVIDIA NVDA and Meta Platforms META also posted strong advances of 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively.Tesla shares jumped on April 25, extending their recent rally after CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more of his time focusing on Tesla, as the Trump administration is on its way to loosening rules around self-driving cars.The latest administrative move would favor Tesla, which has long promoted autonomous vehicles as key to its growth strategy. Tesla now expects to be selling fully autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, in June, with that business expanding to other cities this year and becoming financially material in the second half of 2026. For the week, Tesla surged 23.8%, Netflix NFLX jumped 11.9%, Amazon AMZN gained 11.6%, Apple AAPL added 8.4%, Microsoft MSFT advanced 8%, Meta surged 11.5%, and NVIDIA leaped 12.5%.Semiconductor stocks staged a massive surge last week as the space had been beaten down heavily. After Trump’s announcement of tariffs, chip biggies sank massively. Now, the cues of easing trade tensions have given the space a special edge at the time of revival.Future Outlook: MixedMeanwhile, market volatility has remained elevated. Uncertainty surrounds U.S.-China trade talks after China said on April 24 that there were no negotiations underway, following earlier U.S. signals suggesting a possible softening in stance.Despite the uncertainty around tariffs and trade, Citi analysts are growing more optimistic about the market's trajectory, the CNBC article noted. Citi believes that as long as the momentum in trade negotiations remains positive and monetary policy becomes more supportive , equities should continue to stabilize and grind higher in the coming months. Possible trade de-escalation and easy money are great for tech stocks.Top-Performing Technology ETFs in Focus Against this backdrop, below we highlight some winning tech-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of the last week.Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF TESL – Up 23.7%SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF XSD – Up 15.2%iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX – Up 13.2%First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund QTEC – Up 11.3%iShares US Technology ETF IYW – Up 10.2%First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN – Up 9.4%Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Tech ETF PSCT – Up 9.2%This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d019289dc094b:0-tech-sizzled-last-week-top-performing-etfs-in-the-sector/

Disney Stock Soars After Earnings. Why It's All About Abu Dhabi and Theme Parks. — Barrons.com,1746643560000,"By George Glover and Angela PalumboDisney stock was soaring Wednesday after the company beat Wall Street's earnings target and unveiled a plan to build a theme park in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.The House of Mouse reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.45 a share and revenue rose 7% from a year ago to $23.6 billion. Analysts expected an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.1 billion, according to a FactSet poll.In afternoon trading, shares jumped 9.7% to $101.15. The stock was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.2%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.Revenue for Disney's experiences segment, which includes its theme parks, rose 6% from a year ago to $8.9 billion. The Street was looking for $8.7 billion. The solid parks revenue growth could help to reassure investors, who had been fretting that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive up inflation and lead to Americans spending less on big-ticket items like vacations.Shortly after it posted earnings, the company announced it would build a park on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. It would be the company's seventh park and first in the Middle East.""This groundbreaking resort destination represents a new frontier in theme park development,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the company's experiences division, said in a statement. ""Our resort in Abu Dhabi will be the most advanced and interactive destination in our portfolio.""The theme park, according to Disney's 10-Q filing, will be built and operated by Miral, a limited liability corporation in the UAE.Disney will license its intellectual property to Miral and will earn royalties based on the project's revenue. Disney didn't rdisclose a launch date or size of the theme park, according to the 10-Q filing.Miral, according to Disney, has developed several family destinations on Yas Island with American and European brands.""It is all their capital and we will get a royalty. So there isn't ownership. We own our IP and license it to them as essentially the arrangement,"" Disney management said on the earnings call.Disney runs its Japanese theme parks similarly. According to the company's most recent annual 10-K filing, Disney earns royalties on revenues generated by the Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land, a third-party Japanese corporation.Disney's streaming division, which includes the Disney+ platform, added 2.5 million subscribers over the quarter ended March 31. Its operating profit rose to $336 million, up from $47 million a year earlier.Disney said it was expecting adjusted earnings of $5.75 a share for its current fiscal year, which ends in September, although it noted that it will be monitoring macroeconomic developments that could shift its outlook. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of $5.43 for the current fiscal year.The earnings beat ought to give the stock a much-needed boost. Disney stock has declined 8.9% in 2025, compared with a 4.9% drop for the S&P 500. Rivals Netflix and Comcast are up 29% and down 8.6%, respectively.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Tech Executives Are Starting to Talk Tariffs. What It May Mean for Apple, Amazon Earnings — Barrons.com",1745691240000,"By Angela PalumboTechnology companies are starting to talk about how Donald Trump's trade war may impact their business. We'll find out more as earnings keep coming next week, with tariffs top of mind.Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Apple, and Spotify are scheduled to report in the coming days. Investors will be listening closely to hear how the trade war may be disrupting supply chains and products shipped from China and other countries facing Trump's tariffs.Some tech companies have already discussed tariffs on earnings calls. But the situation is fluid with exemptions in place for some types of chips, hardware, and iPhones. Trump recently said that 145% on tariffs on Chinese goods would drop ""substantially,"" but the timing is unclear and companies face near-term disruptions in sales.Here's what some tech companies have said, providing a glimpse of what's to come.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet""We're obviously not immune to the macro environment. But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers.""Alphabet didn't mention tariffs on its earnings call Thursday, except indirectly in this quote from Pichai. The de minimis exemption had allowed lower cost packages to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but Trump ended that exemption. Alphabet could be hit if Chinese e-commerce firms like Shein and Temu pull back on ad spending.Meta (parent of Instagram and Facebook) and Amazon are in a similar boat: both generate considerable revenue from advertising. Amazon relies heavily on Chinese suppliers and retailers for its marketplace revenue, and Trump's tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods are certain to sting, along with higher duties on imports from other countries.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla""Tariffs are tough on a company when margins are still low.""Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Musk made it clear that despite his close relationship with the president, he's an advocate for ""free trade and lower tariffs."" A 25% tariff on imported cars and a 25% parts tariff are set to be implemented by early May.More notable is what Tesla didn't say: The company declined to update guidance for the rest of 2025, citing uncertainty around the impact of trade policy on the auto and energy supply chains.Tesla has far more protection from tariffs than other auto makers due to its large manufacturing base in North America; 85% of its vehicles comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to Benchmark Equity Research. Tesla stock is showing signs of life, rising 10% Friday on hopes for new products and the launch of robo-taxis in June.David Zinsner, CFO of Intel""We believe Q1 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior in anticipation of potential tariffs, though it is difficult to quantify the magnitude.""Intel reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Thursday, but gave disappointing second-quarter revenue guidance. Tariffs are causing uncertainty for the company and its customers, even as the Trump administration has put temporary exemptions on some tech products, like laptops. It seems that shoppers have started to take action to get ahead of potentially rising prices; that could bode poorly for the future.One read-through is that Apple may also top estimates, benefiting from accelerated sales of iPhones. Several Wall Street analysts have said they expect the iPhone maker could report better-than-expected revenue due to accelerated demand. The drawback: fewer phone upgrades in the months ahead.William McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow"" Yes, CEOs are mindful that the global economy is in a fluid state. No, they are not standing still.""ServiceNow is an enterprise software company that not only reported better-than-expected first-quarter financials on Wednesday, but also provided stronger-than-expected subscription revenue guidance.ServiceNow offers software solutions to businesses, including those powered by generative artificial intelligence. Companies have been willing to spend big on these software products to boost productivity. There's been worry on Wall Street that enterprises will start to cut back their IT budgets to get ahead of a potential economic slowdown. ServiceNow says that hasn't happened yet.Microsoft, which reports earnings on Wednesday, has a large software business through its Office family of apps. ServiceNow's confidence in the near-term could be a good sign for that part of Microsoft's business.Gregory Peters, Co-CEO of Netflix"" We're paying close attention, clearly, to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving. But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.""Netflix was one of the first tech companies to report its financial results this earnings season. Shares of the streamer have been outperforming the market this year and the company issued a strong outlook.Entertainment isn't directly hit by tariffs, but a slowdown in consumer spending might trickle down: consumers may downgrade to lower-priced plans or cancel service, and Netflix has a growing ad business that could weaken. Netflix asserted on April 17 that it's still in a solid position.For now, it looks like consumers still want to spend on entertainment, which could bode well for other subscription based media platforms, like Spotify Technology. The music streamer is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Disney's Tariff Resilience Is a Surprise - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1746633600000,"By Dan GallagherThe Magic Kingdom hasn't lost its charm-even amid a trade war.Disney's share price jumped Wednesday morning after the entertainment giant posted surprisingly strong quarterly results. These included better-than-expected growth for its U.S. theme parks division, its biggest profit driver. Domestic parks operating income of $1.8 billion was 10% ahead of expectations, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.Investors had worried about Disney's exposure to the wide swath of tariffs unveiled by President Trump last month. Among other concerns, the announcements sparked fears of a sharp downtick in leisure travel, especially for visitors to the U.S. Trump's threat earlier this week to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. didn't help matters.Prior to Wednesday's report, Disney's share price was down nearly 6% from Trump's tariff unveiling on April 2, versus a 22% surge by Hollywood rival Netflix. Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino said Disney was ""priced like the sky is falling"" in an April 21 report.Wednesday report offered reassurance. Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said bookings for Disney World in Florida were up on the year for the quarters ending in June and September.Disney's Experiences business is also a global one, not just dependent on U.S. tourism. This was underscored by the surprise announcement of a new theme park in Abu Dhabi. Meantime, Chief Executive Bob Iger said Disney's massive new cruise ship sold out its first quarter of tickets ""in a matter of days.""The trade war isn't sinking Disney just yet.This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

S&P 500 Climbs Weekly as Tech Sector Leads Amid Positive Earnings,1745613626000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4.6% this week, led by technology stocks amid better-than-expected earnings from a number of companies in the sector including Google parent Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG . The S&P 500 ended Friday's session at 5,525.21. The index is still down 1.5% for the month and 6.1% this year on concerns about the economic impacts of the ongoing trade war between the US and several countries including China. Both Chinese officials and US President Donald Trump, however, softened their tone this week. US consumer sentiment waned for the fourth straight month in April as uncertainty around tariffs dampened expectations and pushed the year-ahead inflation outlook to the highest point since 1981, final results from the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed Friday. While the April reading of 52.2 was down from 57 in March, it was still above the consensus view for 50.5 in a poll compiled by Bloomberg. On the earnings front, Alphabet was in the spotlight as the Google parent not only released better-than-expected Q1 results but also said its board raised its quarterly dividend by 5% and authorized the repurchase of up to another $70 billion in class A and C shares. The company's shares rose by about 7% on the week. The technology sector had the largest percentage increase this week, climbing 7.9%, followed by a 7.4% gain in consumer discretionary and a 6.4% rise in communication services. Financials and industrials rose by about 3% each while materials added 2%. ServiceNow NYSE:NOW had the largest weekly percentage gain in the technology sector, jumping 22% as the company posted Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue above analysts' mean estimates. The company also forecast Q2 subscription revenue above the Street view at the time. In consumer discretionary, Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA shares climbed 18%. The electric vehicle maker's Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue both came in below Street views, but Chief Executive Elon Musk said he will recommit more of his time to the company. That was the ""biggest"" and ""best possible"" news investors could have heard, Wedbush analysts said in a note to clients. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX was the top performer in communication services, rising 13% as the company's Q1 results and Q2 guidance both exceeded analysts' expectations. Consumer staples was the lone sector in the red for the week, dropping 1.4%. Kimberly-Clark NYSE:KMB had the largest percentage drop in consumer staples, falling 7.8%. The company reported Q1 adjusted earnings above the Street view but its revenue slightly missed analysts' mean estimate. Also, Kimberly-Clark reduced its guidance for 2025 adjusted earnings per share. Next week's earnings calendar features Visa (V), Coca-Cola (KO), Pfizer (PFE), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Mastercard (MA), McDonald's (MCD), Berkshire Hathaway NYSE:BRK.A , Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Economic data will include Q1 gross domestic product, March personal consumption expenditures, and the closely watched April employment report and unemployment rate.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250425:A3361699:0/

Netflix Soars to All-Time High: 5 ETFs to Ride the Surge,1745596620000,"Netflix NFLX has reached a historic milestone, with its stock price soaring to an all-time high of nearly $1,101. This surge reflects the company’s robust performance and investor confidence in its growth trajectory, solidifying its position as a leader in the streaming industry. The solid trend is likely to continue given the company’s trillion-dollar ambition and analysts’ increasing target price.Investors seeking to tap the bullish trend should invest in ETFs with the largest allocation to this streaming giant. These are First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN, FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF FDND, MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF GGME, and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC.What’s Driving Netflix Higher?Robust Q1 EarningsThe world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue estimates. The company reported earnings per share of $6.61, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69 and the year-ago earnings of $5.29. Revenues rose 13% year over year to $10.54 billion but were slightly below the consensus estimate of $10.55 billion. Netflix offered an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter. It expects revenues to grow 15% year over year to $11.04 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 44% to $7.03. The guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.96 billion for revenues and $6.22 for earnings per share at the time of issuing the guidance (read: ETFs to Tap Netflix's Q1 Earnings Beat, Solid Growth Outlook).The company launched its in-house ad tech platform on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenue growth to double in 2025, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment. Netflix reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion. Trillion-Dollar StrategyNetflix aims to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by the end of the decade, a significant leap from its current valuation of approximately $466.8 billion. The company plans to double its annual revenues from $39 billion to $80 billion, fueled by its burgeoning ad-supported subscription model and international market expansion. Netflix also forecasts its global advertising revenues to grow to $9 billion by 2030.Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division and building its advertising business. With total subscribers of more than 300 million, the company aims to increase this subscriber base to approximately 410 million by 2030 by focusing on international markets, such as India and Brazil, for much of this expansion.Defensive PlayNetflix has been viewed as a safe haven amid economic uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Its low-cost advertising-supported service plan should give it more resilience if the macroeconomic climate worsens, as tariffs will not directly impact TV shows and films (read: Inside Trump Tariffs and Their Impact on Sector ETFs). Analysts Lift Target PriceMost of the analysts raised the target price on Netflix this week, signaling bullish trends. Analysts from Morgan Stanley and Wedbush raised their price targets to $1,200 from $1,150, while Piper Sandler increased its target by $50 to $1,150. KeyBanc, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank also lifted their targets to $1,070, $1,000, $1,150 and $900, respectively, from the previous levels of $1,000, $955, $1,025 and $875.Following the earnings announcement, Guggenheim raised the target price from $1,100 to $1,150 while BMO Capital increased its target price to $1,200, highlighting the “multi-year durable ad growth opportunity” ahead. MoffettNathanson, Oppenheimer and Pivotal Research raised the price target to $1,150, $1,200 and $1,350, respectively, from $1,100, $1,150 and $1,250.Even cautious analysts like Barclays lifted the target price on Netflix to $1,000, noting that the streaming giant has become a “defensive long” investment in the current economic environment.ETFs in FocusFirst Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) : Netflix occupies the top spot at 10.6%. FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF (FDND): Netflix occupies the top position at 10.7% share.MicroSectors FANG+ ETN (FNGS): Netflix accounts for nearly 10% share in the basket.Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (GGME): Netflix is the top firm, accounting for 9.6% of the GGME assets.Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC): Netflix takes the third position at 7.5% share.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:8bd3b8a22094b:0-netflix-soars-to-all-time-high-5-etfs-to-ride-the-surge/
Amazon to spend $4 billion on cloud infrastructure in Chile,1746623400000,"Amazon's cloud computing division will invest $4 billion to build its first data centers and other cloud infrastructure in Chile, the company's head of South Latin America told Reuters.Amazon Web Services (AWS) expects the cloud region, its third in Latin America after Brazil and Mexico, to be operational by the second half of 2026.In an interview in Santiago on Tuesday, local head of AWS Juan Pablo Estevez said all the necessary permits had been given for the project, which would deliver ""substantial"" computing power for services like generative AI.The surge of data centers globally has caused concerns over energy and water use, which have been amplified in Chile as the country has suffered a drought for more than 15 years.Environmental concerns forced Google to rework plans for a $200 million data center in Chile after a local environmental court partially reversed its permit last September.Microsoft expects its cloud-computing Azure center in Chile to come online this year, according to its website. Estevez said Amazon's cloud region would use water to cool its servers just 4% of the year, the equivalent of about eight homes over a 15-year period, with air and evaporation technology used the rest of the time.He added that Amazon has been matching 100% of its energy consumption with renewable power since 2023.The company already has 36 regions and 114 availability zones worldwide used by companies such as Netflix, General Electric and Sony for storage, networking and remote security.Chilean retailer Cencosud, online retail giant MercadoLibre, and mining companies already use the company's other regional services, it said.Amazon's first-quarter cloud revenue and income forecast came in below estimates last Thursday, but Estevez said he's expecting strong growth in Chile and across the region.""The forecast is that the (Chile's) market will grow 20.3% year over year from now until 2028,"" he said, adding that the market was $1.5 billion last year and estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2025.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RE0UJ:0-amazon-to-spend-4-billion-on-cloud-infrastructure-in-chile/"

Among the seven players, Tesla Inc TSLA shares are the most beaten-down, plunging 31.6% as of the same date.Meanwhile, Netflix Inc. NFLX shares have advanced 23.7% this year. Netflix reported strong first-quarter 2025 results after the closing bell on April 17. The world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed on revenues.Inside the Bullish Outlook of Netflix Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Netflix offers an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter and several analysts raised the target price on the stock, signaling bullish trends. Nine out of 11 analysts upped their earnings estimates for the upcoming quarter over the past seven days, while none cut estimates. Netflix’s earnings estimate for the June quarter stands at $7.05 per share, up from $6.22 recorded seven days ago.What’s Happening to Tesla?Zacks Rank # 4 (Sell) Tesla TSLA reported dismal first-quarter 2025 results this week, missing estimates for earnings and revenues. However, shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% in after-market hours (after reporting the earnings results) after CEO Elon Musk injected optimism by reaffirming the company’s goals for the launch of robotaxis and affordable vehicles. Musk’s promise to refocus on his business rekindled investor hopes.There has been no movement in earnings estimates for Tesla over the past seven days. However, seven out of 10 analysts cut their estimates over the past 30 days for the earnings of the upcoming quarter. Zacks Consensus Earnings estimate for Tesla for the June quarter stands at 57 cents, down from 63 cents over the past one-month period.Could Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?As Tesla’s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix is emerging as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow, and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock is in the green, defying the Mag-7 candidates.Netflix is known for its free cash flow strength. It reported $2.661 billion free cash flow (FCF) in Q1, up 24.5% year over year and 93% from the prior quarter. Moreover, its FCF margin shot up to 25.2% from 15% in Q4, implying NFLX stock could be worth much more. Netflix's revenue grew by just 12.5% year over year, but free cash flow (FCF) jumped 24.5% — from $2.137 billion to $2.661 billion — nearly twice as fast.

NetflixTesla trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 99.34X (even after this year’s crash) compared with the past median value of 125.01X.

Trump's movie tariff threat alarms India's film makers,1746605200000,"India's film industry, which earns roughly 40% of its overseas revenue from the United States, sounded the alarm this week about higher costs after President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of 100% on all movies produced beyond American soil.Film makers, producers and distributors in one of the world's largest film industries by output struggled to weigh the likely impact of such a tariff as Trump provided scant details, stirring more questions than answers.""The real question is how the term 'foreign produced' will be defined, and until that's clear, it's hard to say anything,"" said film maker Anubhav Sinha, known for his Netflix streaming series, ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"". ""It's not yet clear whether services like post-production will be affected.""India's film industry employs 272,000 people, with overseas box office takings of about 20 billion rupees ($237 million) in fiscal 2024, or a tenth of total earnings, Deloitte and studio grouping the Motion Picture Association said in a report.Key Hollywood films with India scenes are Oscar-winners such as the rags-to-riches tale ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and the Osama bin Laden manhunt thriller, ""Zero Dark Thirty"", along with rom-com ""Eat, Pray Love"", and Batman outing ""The Dark Knight Rises"". In the absence of details on the planned levy, film producers worry it could double the cost of exporting their films to the United States, where people of Indian descent are estimated to number 5.2 million.""The United States is one of the most important overseas markets for Indian cinema, largely due to the substantial diaspora,"" said producer Madhu Bhojwani, reponsible for hits such as ""Airlift"", on workers evacuated from Kuwait during the Gulf War. ""Any increase in ticket prices resulting from these tariffs would directly affect audience turnout, compounding the challenges posed by evolving consumer behaviour and broader industry headwinds.""The cost-effective South Asian nation has also grown in stature as Hollywood's preferred hub for on-ground production and post-production services, especially in visual effects, since it offers a skilled talent pool.""Almost 10 to 15 (foreign) movies are shot in India every year, and our movie industry will be impacted very badly,"" said film trade analyst Komal Nahta. LIKELY HIT TO REVENUEProminent Indian actor and producer Prakash Raj called Trump's move ""tariff terrorism"".If the tariff covers post-production services, the consequences will be bigger, added Bhojwani, the co-founder of Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures.""We can expect a potential decline in outsourced work from U.S. studios to Indian vendors, which could have notable implications for the Indian media services sector,"" she said. ""If revenue from the U.S. drops, it could affect budget planning and profitability for Indian production houses,"" said Pradeep Dwivedi, chief executive of Eros International Media NSE:EROSMEDIA .""Big-budget films counting on overseas revenue could be restructured or scaled back.""The move will also hurt smaller releases in the United States.""Even a 30% drop in revenue for such mid-scale movies would be a significant dent,"" said Raj Kandukuri, producer of a well-regarded film, ""Pelli Choopulu"", in India's southern language of Telugu. ""There are a sizeable number of students in the United States who watch movies, they will not spend high on ticket prices.""The planned levy might also drive a broader shift to digital platforms.""U.S. distributors might be less inclined to pick up Indian titles due to the increased cost,"" Dwivedi said.""This could result in fewer screens, smaller releases, and a shift toward digital platforms instead of theatrical. The tariff would likely accelerate a move toward direct-to-digital releases on platforms like ErosNow, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.""

"Roku Introduces New Device Line-Up: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745510820000,"Roku ROKU has unveiled new streaming devices and software updates, improving the “Roku Experience” for more than 90 million households. Innovations include personalized content discovery, a new “Coming Soon to Theaters” row, and streamlined sports highlights, making TV more tailored to each viewer.The company also introduced its most compact streaming sticks, upgraded Roku-made TVs, and expanded into smart home tech with battery-powered indoor and outdoor cameras. Roku’s Smart Home OS and new Smart Projector design aim to increase user engagement. These innovations are part of Roku’s broader strategy to make streaming simpler, more connected, and more enjoyable, while continuing to grow its presence in the global home entertainment and smart device markets.Why ROKU’s New Launches Deserve AttentionRoku’s device segment faced significant challenges in the fourth quarter of 2024, as weak holiday demand and excess inventory led to aggressive discounting, pressuring profit margins. While the company anticipates a return to normal margins in 2025, near-term device profits are expected to remain flat despite potential sales growth.This makes Roku’s latest product launches especially timely. The introduction of compact streaming sticks, upgraded Roku TVs, and smart home devices is aimed at reigniting sales momentum and expanding user engagement. These innovations not only improve the overall “Roku Experience” but also help differentiate the brand in a crowded market, positioning Roku to recover from recent setbacks and continue growing its platform business.ROKU’s Financial Performance and MilestonesRoku hit a major milestone in the fourth quarter of 2024, crossing $1 billion in platform revenues for the first time, which was up 25% year over year. The company ended the year with 89.8 million global streaming households, gaining 4.3 million in the fourth quarter alone. Roku passed 90 million households in early January 2025 and aims to reach 100 million soon through continued platform growth and global expansion.User engagement also climbed, with total streaming hours rising 18% year over year to 34.1 billion in the fourth quarter and reaching 127.1 billion for 2024. The Roku Channel stood out, with an 82% surge in streaming hours, now reaching about 145 million U.S. viewers. It remains the #3 app on the platform by reach and engagement, helping drive Roku’s ad-supported revenue momentum.ROKU Offers Promising Guidance for 2025For 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $4.61 billion, indicating 12% year-over-year growth. Platform revenues are anticipated to reach $3.95 billion, suggesting an increase of 12% year over year. Excluding political ad spending, this suggests 15% growth, slightly above the 2024 rate.Roku projects an adjusted EBITDA of $350 million for 2025, indicating a 35% increase from the 2024 level. This demonstrates improving profitability as the company scales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.59 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 11.58%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pinned at 1 cent per share, which has been revised upward from a loss of 26 cents per share over the past seven days. Roku’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 55.07%See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.ROKU Faces Intense Competition in AdvertisingRoku operates in a highly competitive advertising industry and competes for revenues with other companies that have launched ad-supported streaming. Some of these companies include Netflix NFLX, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD and Disney DIS. Since its launch, Netflix’s ad-supported tier reached 70 million global monthly users as of late 2024, while Warner Bros. Discovery expanded its ad-supported tier on Max to more than 45 countries in the past 15 months. As of January this year, Disney had approximately 157 million global monthly active users watching ad-supported content across its streaming platforms. If Roku is unable to improve its own platform’s capabilities to face the increasing competition, both business and growth prospects of the company may be harmed.Stock Price Performance and Valuation of ROKUIn the year-to-date period, Roku shares have plunged 20.3%, underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 7% and the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s growth of 9.3%. Shares of its competitors Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney have lost 24.7% and 22.7%, respectively, while Netflix has gained 16.7%.ROKU’s YTD Price PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, Roku currently trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 41.78X, which is at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 30.28X. While this valuation gap suggests that investors have high growth expectations for this stock, it is not a good pick for a value investor. A value score of D further reinforces an unattractive valuation for ROKU at this moment. ROKU Is Trading at a PremiumConclusion: Hold ROKU Stock for NowDespite recent margin pressures in its device segment and fierce competition in the ad-supported streaming space, Roku’s long-term outlook remains promising. The company is making smart investments in product innovation, platform enhancements, and international expansion, all of which aim to increase user engagement and grow monetization. Its strong growth in platform revenues, rising streaming hours, and expanding user base reflect a scalable business model. However, elevated valuation levels and underperformance in the stock price suggest that near-term caution is warranted. As Roku continues improving profitability and executing on its strategy, investors should monitor its progress and consider holding the stock for now.ROKU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Can Netflix Run Continue Despite Tariff Threat?,1746566580000,"The latest tariff news over the weekend had to do with the movie industry. President Trump authorized the Department of Commerce and the USTR to immediately begin the process of instituting 100% tariff on any and all foreign movies coming into the US. While many wondered how exactly that would look given the state of streaming nowadays, it still made a negative impact on Netflix ( NFLX ) Monday morning.The stock gapped down to open the day at $1,114.80, getting as low as $1,107.01. The stock was bid most of the day, closing $10 off its high for the day at $1,134.06. Netflix has been on a tear lately after testing its 200-day, dipping to $821.10 on Monday, April 7th before finding a bid. Earnings helped it along as well.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Netflix’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:354e85034094b:0-can-netflix-run-continue-despite-tariff-threat/
Netflix’s Trillion-Dollar Baby Ambition: Realistic or Ridiculous?,1745510280000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , by far the world’s most dominant pure-play streaming stock, just had its eye-popping intentions revealed. A report from the Wall Street Journal says that the company is aiming to grow its market capitalization to $1 trillion by the year 2030 . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix would need to add a whopping $650 billion to its market cap over the next five years to achieve this goal.This would mean adding value around four times the current market cap of one of its largest competitors, the Walt Disney Company NYSE:DIS . This alone demonstrates the monumental task Netflix is undertaking. This analysis will examine what Netflix needs to do to achieve this target , both from a return standpoint and from a business perspective. Can this communications leader realistically attain membership in the $1 trillion club ? This may not be as improbable as it initially sounds.20% Return CAGR or Bust: Netflix’s Journey to $1 TrillionAssuming Netflix aims to achieve this goal by the end of 2030, it would likely need to  massively outperform the market . The S&P 500 Index has averaged around a 10% annual return since 1957. The stock would need to grow from its Apr. 23 closing market cap of about $447 billion to $1 trillion in roughly 4.5 years. That would require a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), or about double the S&P 500’s historical return. That’s close to the 19% CAGR Netflix stock delivered over the past 4.5 years, although returns tend to get harder as a stock grows.However, size is by no means mutually exclusive from large returns. Take Magnificent Seven stocks Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , and Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG for example. They have achieved return CAGRs of 25%, 23%, and 20% , respectively, over the last five years. An argument certainly exists that once a company achieves a level of size and dominance, it significantly increases its ability to expand its business. Companies of immense size have the ability to make huge bets that can result in massive payoffs. They can also exert their market power to destroy competitors. Overall, simply from a return viewpoint, Netflix’s $1 trillion mission by 2030 is a big hill to climb, but it is far from outside the realm of possibility.Keys to $1 Trillion: Doubling Down on Global Growth and Ad MonetizationOn the business side, Netflix has several key metrics it aims to hit to reach the imposing $1 trillion mark. It wants to add over 100 million new subscribers, growing to 410 million users from the current 302 million. Further expansion into countries like India and Brazil is one path Netflix sees to do this. These added subscribers will go toward doubling total revenues from $39 billion annually in 2024 to $78 billion in 2030. Within this, Netflix wants to grow its advertising sales to $9 billion annually. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Targeting India makes a lot of sense when it comes to growing subscriptions. It is the world’s most populous country, with nearly 1.5 billion people. Netflix already has a decent foothold there, with approximately 12 million subscribers. Experts expect the number of internet users in India to surpass 900 million in 2025. That points to a massive opportunity for Netflix, which remains significantly underpenetrated in the country. Making meaningful gains there could go a long way in helping Netflix reach its subscriber targets.Netflix also has a huge ability to grow its advertising business. Data from eMarketer shows how U.S. adults spend nearly an equal amount of their time online using Netflix as they do on Meta’s apps and YouTube. However, Netflix accounts for less than 1% of total ad spending. Meanwhile, Meta raked in 21% of total ad spending, and YouTube saw over 5%. This highlights that while overall engagement on Netflix is strong , ad monetization remains low, presenting a significant revenue growth opportunity. The company’s new ad-tech stack, Ads Suite, should help drive monetization.Although Netflix’s $1 trillion target may seem daunting when taken at face value, it's not as crazy as it sounds. The company has many ways to drive its stock higher, even outside of the avenues discussed above. When it comes to reaching a $1 trillion market cap, it makes sense not to count Netflix out.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:413912ff2094b:0-netflix-s-trillion-dollar-baby-ambition-realistic-or-ridiculous/
Netflix Stock Has Been a 'Tariff Safe Haven.' That's About to Change. — Barrons.com,1746551340000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix stock has been a solid outperformer this year, but concerns about film tariffs have given investors pause.President Donald Trump announced Sunday that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a research note on Tuesday that Netflix ""has been viewed by investors as a 'safe haven' with respect to tariffs.""That safe haven is at risk now following Trump's announcement, and Bazinet wrote the worst case scenario for Netflix would be if the 100% tariff on content produced outside of the U.S. was implemented.""We estimate 50% of content produced by Netflix is created outside the US,"" Bazinet wrote. ""With a 100% tariff, we estimate this could reduce EPS by around $6 per share.""Bazinet, who rates Netflix as Neutral with $1,020 price target, wrote that he believes Netflix will do all it can to mitigate the tariff impacts, which could include shifting production to the U.S., restricting U.S. access to content produced outside the country, and raising prices.There's still a lot of uncertainty around what these tariffs will actually look like.Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok wrote on Tuesday the impact to entertainment companies ""is subject to a vast number of variable terms, including the decision to actually implement the tariff or not, the timing of implementation, and any potential exceptions negotiated by companies or countries.""Netflix declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment Tuesday.Although stocks have taken a hit over tariff worries, Netflix shares have gained 28% this year, compared with the 4.4% decline in the S&P 500.Shares dropped 1.9% on Monday, however, which was the stock's first day closing in the red since April 16. Netflix stock was up 0.8% in midday trading Tuesday.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Netflix's Trillion-Dollar Dream: Should Investors Buy the Stock Now?,1745509140000,"Netflix NFLX has set its sights on an ambitious target that has caught the attention of investors worldwide: doubling its revenues by 2030 and achieving a $1 trillion market capitalization. This bold declaration comes on the heels of the streaming giant's impressive first-quarter 2025 performance, which saw the company beat earnings expectations with $6.61 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.17% and jumping 54.8% year over year. (Read More: Netflix Q1 Earnings Beat, Revenues Rise Y/Y on Subscriber Gain).The company has consistently outperformed market indices, with a 39.1% six-month return, significantly outpacing other streaming competitors like Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Disney DIS, as well as the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500. Shares of Apple, Disney and Amazon have lost 11.6%, 8.1% and 3.8%, respectively, in the same time frame.NFLX Outperforms Sector, CompetitionThe Growth Strategy Behind the Trillion-Dollar VisionNetflix's path to a trillion-dollar valuation isn't just wishful thinking — it's backed by a comprehensive growth strategy focused on four key areas. The company plans to expand its already robust content library, further develop its increasingly successful live programming options, enhance its gaming division, and build out its rapidly growing advertising business. NFLX’s content diversity spans genres, languages, and formats, creating multiple growth engines for the company. In the second quarter, new films include Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Tyler Perry's new drama Straw starring Taraji P. Henson, Bullet Train Explosion (Japan) and Havoc , an action thriller starring Tom Hardy and Forest Whitaker. New series include Forever , a modern-day take on the classic Judy Blume novel; romantic comedy The Royals (India); The Four Seasons , a comedy starring Tina Fey, Steve Carell and Colman Domingo; El Eternauta (Argentina); and Ransom Canyon , a romantic western. America’s Sweethearts: The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders , Black Mirror and Ginny & Georgia are all back for brand new seasons. Netflix has also slated the series finales of the Emmy Award-winning adult animated series Big Mouth and fan-favorite YOU . Furthermore, Netflix's live programming strategy has already delivered notable successes, including the Paul-Tyson fight, which became the most-streamed sporting event ever. The company also recently secured the U.S. rights for FIFA's Women's World Cup in 2027 and 2031, demonstrating its commitment to strategic live content acquisition rather than pursuing expensive regular-season sports packages.Ad-Supported Tier: The Hidden Growth AcceleratorPerhaps the most promising aspect of Netflix's growth strategy is its advertising business. According to company data, more than 55% of new subscribers in markets where it's available are choosing the ad-supported option. Management projects advertising revenues reaching $9 billion annually by 2030, representing a significant new revenue stream.The company recently launched its Ad Suite in the United States on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025 alone, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment. This diversification of revenue streams adds stability to Netflix's growth trajectory and reduces its reliance solely on subscription growth.Financial Health Supports Long-Term AmbitionNetflix's financial position remains robust, with first-quarter 2025 revenues reaching $10.54 billion, up 12.5% year over year. The operating margin expanded impressively to 31.7%, up 370 basis points year over year. Free cash flow for the quarter was pinned at $2.66 billion compared with $1.37 billion in the previous quarter.For the second quarter of 2025, Netflix forecasts revenues to increase 15.4% to $11.035 billion and projects an operating margin of 33%, representing a ~6 percentage point year-over-year improvement. The company maintains its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion and free cash flow forecast of approximately $8 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.47 billion, indicating 14.01% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $25.33 per share, indicating a 27.74% increase from the previous year.See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news .Premium Valuation Justified by Exceptional PerformanceWhile Netflix trades at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 9.77 compared to the broader Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward earnings multiple of 3.91, this valuation appears justified given the company's unique position at the intersection of technology and entertainment. Netflix's ability to outcompete both traditional media companies and tech giants speaks to its exceptional business model and execution.NFLX’s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Premium ValuationInvestment Opportunity in 2025For investors, Netflix presents a compelling opportunity in 2025. NFLX's strong content lineup for 2025, including new seasons of its biggest shows like Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things , positions the company for continued subscriber growth. Combined with its expanding advertising business, innovative gaming initiatives, and strategic live programming acquisitions, Netflix has multiple catalysts to drive growth toward its trillion-dollar ambition.Investors should consider that Netflix continues to hold a leadership position in engagement (approximately two hours per paid membership per day), revenues ($39 billion), and profit ($10 billion in operating income) in a market that continues to expand. With streaming still representing less than 10% of TV hours globally, Netflix has substantial runway for growth.For long-term investors seeking exposure to the continuing evolution of global entertainment consumption, Netflix's strategic vision and execution capabilities make it a compelling buy in 2025, despite its premium valuation. NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Disney Stock Is Struggling. Why Theme-Park Earnings Will Be Key for Any Rebound. — Barrons.com,1746530340000,"By George GloverEarnings from The Walt Disney Co. will give investors a sense of how the entertainment company's most profitable business is holding up, amid worries that President Donald Trump's tariffs could cause U.S. consumer spending to plummet.Disney is set to post its results for the March quarter ahead of the opening bell. It's expected to report an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.09 billion, according to a FactSet poll. A year ago, it reported a profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $21.8 billion.Shares could do with a boost: They have plunged 17% this year, compared with a 3.9% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock is lagging behind rivals Netflix and NBCUniversal parent Comcast, which are up 27% and down 8.2%, respectively, in 2025.Investors see Disney as more exposed to tariffs than its peers. That is because the company made about 60% of its profit over the last fiscal year from its experiences business, which includes theme parks. If the levies drive up inflation, consumers could start spending less on big-ticket items such as vacations, which would weigh on the House of Mouse's top and bottom lines.Analysts are predicting revenue for the experiences segment will have climbed 3.9% from a year ago to $8.7 billion. If that number comes in higher-than-expected, expect Disney shares to rally.Investors will also be hoping for another quarter of growth for Disney's streaming business, which turned its first-ever profit in 2024. They could also zero in on revenue for the company's studios segment, which is reeling from a failed live-action Snow White remake . The film cost nearly $300 million to produce, but flopped amid a backlash about its casting and use of CGI ""dwarfs.""Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Buy and Hold Netflix to Enhance Your Portfolio Amid Ongoing Volatility,1745497440000,"Global streaming giant Netflix Inc. NFLX has become a new icon for defensive picks by investors amid the Trump administration’s tariff-led severe volatility on Wall Street. In the recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, NFLX handsomely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for bottom line while the top line was mostly in line with the consensus mark. Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels staying ahead of its closest rival The Walt Disney Co. DIS. What is more, the company reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.Netflix currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . At this stage, it will be prudent to buy this stock and hold for the long term as the company’s strong execution of the last few quarters and robust future projections will generate more value. Consequently, the stock price should witness an attractive upside. The chart below shows the price performance of NFLX year to date.Excellent Estimate Revisions for NetflixWe have seen positive revenues and earnings estimate revisions for Netflix by market participants after the release of first-quarter 2025 financial numbers. For second-quarter 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $11.05 billion, suggesting an improvement of 15.6% year over year and earnings per share of $6.96, indicating an increase of 42.6% year over year. The company pulled off positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters delivering an average beat of 6.9%. Moreover, NFLX has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions (+3.1%) for 2025 in the last seven days. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 13.9% and 27.3%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2025. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 11.6% and 20.3%, respectively.Visibility Remains HighThe primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Buoyed by its scalable ad business, NFLX is expected to leverage its own proprietary ad system, doling away with Microsoft Corp. MSFT as its ad-tech partner. The company’s policies of offering ad-supported lower-prices tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Attractive Valuation of NFLX SharesOn Feb 14, the stock price touched its all-time high of $1,064.5. Thereafter, it fell to $821.1 on April 7, due to the tariff-related mayhem on Wall Street. Despite facing severe volatility, shares of Netflix are up 17.8% year to date, while the broad-market index — the S&P 500 Index — is down 8.4%.Netflix has a long-term (3-5 years) growth rate of 20.4%, well above the growth rate of 12.6% of Wall Street’s benchmark — the S&P 500 Index. The company has a return on equity (ROE) of 39.6% compared with the S&P 500’s ROE of 17% and the industry’s ROE of 6.2%. NFLX has a current net margin of 23.07% compared with the S&P 500’s net margin of 12.7%.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4cf0be619094b:0-buy-and-hold-netflix-to-enhance-your-portfolio-amid-ongoing-volatility/

These 3 Companies Crushed Earnings Season,1748013300000,"The 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly winding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has overall been positive, though commentary surrounding upcoming periods has largely dictated post-earnings moves amid elevated uncertainty stemming from tariff talks.Still, several companies – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – knocked it out of the park, posting robust results that had shareholders pleased. Let’s take a closer look at each release for those interested in near-term momentum.Netflix Shares SurgeConsistently strong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors amid the uncertain environment. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid other trends like the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has been the real highlight from Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.As shown below, Netflix’s sales growth has remained rock-solid, posting double-digit percentage YoY growth in six consecutive periods.Eaton Breaks RecordsEaton’s results were fantastic, with the company posting record Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.72 (up 13% YoY), record Q1 sales of $6.4 billion (up 7% YoY), and record segment margins of 23.9% (80 bp increase YoY). Further, organic sales growth totaled 9%, above the high end of previous guidance. ETN topped off the results by raising its organic revenue growth guidance for its current fiscal year.Backlog growth within its Electrical segment improved 6% year-over-year, whereas its Aerospace backlog also enjoyed a 16% surge from the year-ago period. The company’s top line has shown solid, consistent growth, as shown below.In addition to consistent sales growth, the company has shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, sporting a 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. As shown in the annual chart below, ETN’s dividend growth has remained strong not just over the last five years, but over the last decade overall.Please note that the final value in the chart below is tracked on a trailing twelve-month basis, as the company’s current fiscal year hasn’t ended yet.Centene Raises OutlookAdjusted EPS of $2.90 and sales of $46.6 billion from Centene blew away our consensus estimates, with earnings up a strong 28% year-over-year. Higher than expected membership growth led the company to up its 2025 premium and service revenues guidance by $6.0 billion, which already improved by a strong 17% YoY throughout the quarter.As shown below, Centene’s sales have remained strong over recent periods, with the most recent period reflecting a notable acceleration. The company also maintained its current year EPS guidance, providing investors with a nice sense of stability in an anxious setting.Analysts adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the release and guidance upgrade, with Centene now expected to post $179.6 billion in revenues in its current fiscal year. The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bottom LineThe 2025 Q1 earnings season is slowly grinding down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering their results. The period has been positive so far, with all three companies above – Netflix NFLX, Eaton ETN, and Centene CNC – posting robust results and either reaffirming or raising their guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:b0e15118c094b:0-these-3-companies-crushed-earnings-season/
Disney Earnings: A Closer Look,1746486960000,"Earnings season continues to move rapidly, with this week by far reflecting the busiest yet. So far, the performance has been decent, but recent tariff talks have caused analysts to downwardly revise their earnings expectations for the current (Q2) and coming periods.This week, we’ll hear from entertainment titan Disney DIS. Disney has assets that span movies, television shows, and theme parks.But how does the company shape up heading into its earnings release, particularly on the streaming side? We can use streaming results from Netflix NFLX as a small read-through on the level of demand among consumers. Let’s take a closer look.Netflix ImpressesStrong results have led to NFLX’s surge over the past year, with the reaffirmation of FY25 guidance in its latest print going a long way in alleviating investors. Up 90% over the past year, the stock has been a massive bright spot, with its run seemingly being ignored by many amid the AI frenzy.Continued subscriber growth has overall been the name of the game for Netflix, with the company reporting a negative subscriber growth rate just once over its last 12 quarters. The ad-supported tiers were a big surprise to consumers initially given Netflix’s popularity for being ad-free, but the success of the implementation is notable.A big crackdown on password sharing, though initially met with blowback among subscribers, has also unlocked many obvious benefits as the company looks to capture revenue from viewers who were potentially watching without an individual subscription.Disney Outlook Remains BearishAnalysts haven’t been bullish for Disney’s quarter to be reported, with the current $1.18 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate down roughly 3% since the beginning of February. The value suggests a 3% pullback YoY, whereas sales are expected to grow 5% to $23.1 billion.The company exited its latest period with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscriptions, and more than 120 million Disney+ Core paid subscribers, which reflected an increase of 4.4 million over the prior quarter.So while the company has seen overall subscriber growth, the pace relative to NFLX is much lower, likely a reflection of NFLX’s successful business implementations that got them back on track to subscriber growth.The broader revisions picture for Disney also remains bearish, with the stock sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to negative revisions across the board.Bottom LineWe’ve got a big-time entertainment giant on the reporting docket this week – Disney DIS. A peer concerning streaming, Netflix NFLX, posted notably strong results, reporting great growth overall.Analysts haven’t been bullish regarding Disney’s earnings outlook, with the current Zacks Consensus EPS estimate seeing negative revisions since February. Its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating also reflects a broader negative revisions picture overall. Investors should watch for positive earnings estimate revisions post-earnings if commentary supports them, which would reflect a meaningful change in sentiment overall.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6e89f02cf094b:0-disney-earnings-a-closer-look/
"Lions Gate shareholders approve split of studio and Starz business, source says",1745440357000,"Shareholders of Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFa.N), the studio behind the ""John Wick"" movie franchise, have approved a plan to split its film and TV studio from the Starz business, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.The split is intended to streamline operations and better position the company to compete in an industry where customers are shifting from cable TV to streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video NASDAQ:AMZN , YouTube and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX .The standalone Lionsgate Studios (LION.O) business includes the company's Motion Picture Group, Television Studio operations, and a library of more than 20,000 film and television titles.In December, Bloomberg News reported that activist investor Anson Funds Management had taken a stake in Lionsgate Studios and was urging the company to explore strategic options, including a potential sale. Last year, Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA said it planned to spin off the bulk of its fading NBCUniversal cable TV networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, as the company is repositioning itself for growth in the streaming era.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3R11X9:0-lions-gate-shareholders-approve-split-of-studio-and-starz-business-source-says/"
ProSieben boards advise against takeover bid from Berlusconis' MFE,1747909089000,"The boards of ProSiebenSat.1 XETR:PSM have advised against an ""inadequate"" takeover bid from MFE-MediaForEurope MIL:MFEA , the TV broadcaster controlled by Italy's Berlusconi family, the German broadcaster said on ThursdayMFE, which has commercial TV operations in Italy and Spain, made an offer for ProSieben in March as part of a push to create a pan-European broadcaster - a strategy resisted by ProSieben, which is striving to remain independent. ""Both governing bodies have concluded that the offer is inadequate from a financial perspective,"" ProSiebenSat.1 said in a statement, adding that it ""does not reflect the expected future development of the value of the company"".Milan-listed MFE, which holds a 30.14% stake in ProSieben declined to comment.Earlier this month, Czech investment firm PPF, which holds a 15% stake in ProSiben, launched a bid to lift its stake in the German broadcaster up to 29.99%, a move welcomed by ProSiebenSat.MFE made a cash-and-share bid at the minimum level allowed by German takeover rules, offering 4.48 euros in cash and 0.4 MFE A shares per ProSiebenSat.1 share.That is below the current share price of 7.09 euros and PPF's offer of 7 euros per share. Having already crossed a 30% threshold which normally triggers a mandatory 100% takeover offer under German law, MFE will have the option to buy additional shares in the market after the end of its buyout bid.However, a source close to the matter told Reuters last week that it is also weighing whether to raise its bid in response to the counter-proposal by PPF.MFE is looking to build a European ad-funded TV platform to resist competition from the likes of U.S. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and is pushing for an accelerated sale of ProSiebenSat.1's online investments in order to reduce its debt.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RU0ON:0-prosieben-boards-advise-against-takeover-bid-from-berlusconis-mfe/"
Movie-Tariff Plan Rattles Media Stocks. The Fine Print Will Be Critical. — Barrons.com,1746480480000,"By Elsa Ohlen and Angela PalumboShares of U.S. media companies fell as President Donald Trump took aim at the movie industry, saying he will impose a 100% import tax on films produced abroad.""I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday night. He referred to efforts by other countries to create incentives for domestic production as a national security threat.""Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,"" a White House spokesperson said.Netflix fell 1.9%, Warner Bros slid 2%, while Paramount was down 1.6%. Cinemark shares dropped 1.7%. Walt Disney slipped 0.4% and Comcast was flat.The S&P 500 was down 0.6%.None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment.Trump's announcement comes after China said in April that it was cutting imports of American films following U.S. tariff decisions. A tariff on films also would mark a shift in the Trump administration's trade policy. Until now, the White House has focused on taxing physical goods, not services.Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan said the tariff announcement ""injects further noise into sentiment for essentially every entertainment stock.""While tariffs risk denting the profitability of movie makers because a decent chunk of Hollywood's output is shot overseas to take advantage of tax benefits and other incentives, the extent of the damage would depend on the fine print. It wasn't clear whether movies and TV shows shot overseas but finished in the U.S., or content made abroad but available to U.S. audiences, would be subject to the tariff.Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a research note on Monday that it was also unclear if these tariffs would be strictly designed for movies set for theatrical releases, or will also affect streamed-only films. That would be a crucial distinction for a company like Netflix, which releases its originals on its streaming platform.""We think the large studios and distributors including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount, Comcast/NBC Universal, Lionsgate, and Sony, and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" she wrote.For now, analysts are sticking with their stock recommendations and share-price targets, though Reese noted that the news could weigh on movie companies in the near term. She reiterated a Neutral rating on Cinemark with a price target of $32, citing uncertainty around tariffs.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Warner Bros. Stock Rises. Max Follows Netflix With Password Crackdown. — Barrons.com,1745416440000,"By George GloverWarner Bros. Discovery stock was rising Wednesday after the media and entertainment company revealed a new feature for its Max streaming service that sets the stage for a password-sharing crackdown.Warner Bros. said late Tuesday that it would roll out Extra Member Add-Ons for Max, allowing users to add someone who doesn't live in their household on their account for an additional $7.99 a month.Shares climbed 5.9% to $8.41 in early trading. The S&P 500 was up 2.4%.The feature is ""designed to help viewers with a new way to enjoy our best-in-class content at an exceptional value, and offer subscribers greater flexibility in managing their accounts,"" the conglomerate's CEO and President for global streaming and games JB Perrette said in a statement.The move could pave the way for Max to clamp down on password sharing outside of the household. Similar changes made by Netflix a couple of years ago have helped boost the streamer's revenue, sparking a rally that has lifted its shares to a record high.Some investors might question the timing of this move, though: Warner Bros. is pushing for extra revenue at a time when forecasters are worried that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans could drive up inflation and cause consumers to cut back on spending. If that happens, there's a chance some users could decide a Max account isn't worth the money if they can't share it, and cancel their subscription altogether.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Epic Games' Fortnite returns to Apple App Store in US after nearly 5 years,1747781346000,"Epic Games' wildly popular multiplayer shooter game ""Fortnite"" is available again on Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL App Store in the U.S. from Tuesday, capping a ban of nearly five years and marking a major win for the video game company. Epic Games, a U.S.-based studio backed by China's Tencent HKEX:700 , has been locked in a legal battle with Apple since 2020. Epic Games alleged the iPhone maker's practice of charging a commission of up to 30% on in-app payments violated U.S. antitrust rules.Fortnite's return to Apple's iOS systems in the U.S. follows an April 30 ruling by a federal judge saying that Apple violated a U.S. court order that required the company to allow greater competition for app downloads and payment methods in its App Store. The ruling also said that Apple had failed to comply with the judge's prior injunction order and would be referred to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Fortnite's return to its App Store. ""We back fam,"" Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney posted on social media platform X.Launched in 2017, Fortnite became an instant hit, drawing millions of players around the world thanks to its last-player-standing, ""battle royale"" format. At the time of the ban, Epic had 116 million users just on Apple's platform.""For Epic Games this was a hard fought win that carried a very steep price and may be too late to boost its Fortnite game that is now past its prime,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson. ""For Apple this is another crack in the armor that the services business relies on — the funneling of payments through Apple in order to charge developers for every transaction.""Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, said this opened the door for subscription apps like Spotify NYSE:SPOT and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX to claw back margin and for independent studios to monetize without having to pay Apple an extra commission, potentially reshaping iOS economics over the next 12-18 months. Apple and Alphabet's Google NASDAQ:GOOG had banned Fortnite from their stores in 2020 over a tussle about in-app payment guidelines. The game had already returned to Google's Android devices worldwide and iPhones in the EU last year.The game title was also available on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union, Fortnite said on X on Tuesday.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RS1LP:0-epic-games-fortnite-returns-to-apple-app-store-in-us-after-nearly-5-years/"

4 Broadcast Radio & TV Stocks to Buy From a Prospering Industry,1745410800000,"The Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has been grappling with an escalation in cord-cutting despite a surge in demand for streaming content. However, industry players such as Netflix NFLX, Gray Media GTN, Fox Corporation FOXA and TEGNA TGNA, are reaping the benefits of a massive spike in digital content consumption. These companies are thriving due to their diverse content offerings, which include original, regional, and short-form content tailored for small screens like smartphones and tablets. Improved Internet speed and penetration, coupled with technological advancements, have been advantageous for industry participants. As monetization and revenues from advertising spending continue to be modest, strategies focused on profit protection, cash management and greater technology integration have gained significance and are expected to aid these companies in driving top-line growth in the near term.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry encompasses companies that provide entertainment, sports, news, non-fiction, and musical content across television, radio, and digital media platforms. These entities generate revenues through the sale of television and radio programs, advertising slots and subscriptions. With technological advancements and a growing demand for virtual reality and Internet radio, industry players are increasing their investments in research and development, as well as sales and marketing efforts, to remain competitive. The industry's focus is likely to shift toward sustaining current levels of operations, coupled with a renewed emphasis on flexibility. This approach would accelerate the transition to a variable cost model, thereby reducing fixed costs and enhancing agility in the face of evolving market dynamics.4 Broadcast Radio and Television Industry Trends to WatchShift in Consumer Preference a Key Catalyst : To adapt to the evolving landscape, companies are diversifying their content offerings for over-the-top (OTT) services alongside traditional linear TV. The availability of streaming services across a wide range of platforms has enabled them to reach a global audience, expand their international user base and attract advertisers to their platforms, thereby boosting ad revenues. The utilization of services that aid advertisers in measuring their return on investment and enhancing use cases is expected to benefit industry participants. Major leagues and events, such as the NFL, NHL, Olympics, European Games, EPL and elections, also contribute significantly to ad revenue generation.Increased Digital Viewing Fuels Content Demand : Many industry participants, either launching their own OTT services or acquiring existing ones, leverage user insights to deliver tailored content. The surge in digital viewing has made consumer data readily available, allowing companies to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to create or procure targeted content. This approach not only boosts user engagement but also enables industry players to raise the prices of their services at opportune moments without the fear of losing subscribers.Uncertain Macroeconomic Landscape Impedes Production and Ad Demand : Advertising is a significant revenue source for the Broadcast Radio and Television industry. However, industry participants are grappling with the effects of persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, increased capital costs, a soaring U.S. dollar and the looming threat of a recession. These factors have prompted advertisers to trim their ad budgets, which is expected to impact the top-line growth of industry players in the near term. Moreover, intense competition for ad dollars from tech and social media companies has been a significant impediment to the growth of industry participants.Low-Priced Skinny Bundles Impact Revenues : The surge in cord-cutting has compelled industry participants to offer ""skinny bundles."" These Internet-based services often contain fewer channels than traditional subscriptions and are, therefore, more affordable. This move aligns with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing. While these alternative services are expected to keep users engaged with their platforms, increasing the need for additional content, the low-priced skinny bundles are likely to dampen the top-line performance of industry players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Netflix (NFLX) Slips as Trump Floats Movie Tariff Plan,1746476532000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) took a hit Monday after former President Donald Trump announced plans for a 100% tariff on foreign-made films. Shares dropped 4% at the open to $1,113, before recovering to $1,139 by the afternoon, trimming losses to about 1.5%.At its lowest point, Netflix lost $20.4 billion in market capalmost equal to the value of Warner Bros.

Experts raised questions about how a tariff on movies would even work. Would it apply to shows? International co-productions? Visual effects?Netflix has a lot at stake. More than half of its 2024 content budget went toward non-North American productions, and nearly 70% of its subscribers live outside the U.S. and Canada. Big hits like Bridgerton and Squid Game were filmed abroad but helped drive U.S. growth.Until now, Netflix had outperformed most tech peers, with its stock up 30% this year through Friday. A recent Bank of America note called it predictable in an unpredictable world. Mondays tariff talk suggests that might no longer be true.The bigger risk now?

2 Reasons Netflix’s 40% Rally Is Far From Over,1747765860000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Shares of  Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on an absolute tear in recent weeks.They’re now  up more than 40% since the first week of April, breaking through previous records and entering the rarefied four-figure price range . While that kind of move tends to raise concerns about overheating, especially with the RSI now at 68 , there are still two major reasons to believe the rally could continue into the summer, and why any pullback should be viewed as a buying opportunity.1. Fundamentals Are Red HotNetflix’s latest earnings release firmly put its growth story in the spotlight. The company reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that came in well ahead of expectations, with the latter up 12.5% year-over-year . But what stood out most were the operating metrics. Operating income climbed 27% , while operating margin reached 32% , up from 28% a year earlier . Management also guided to even stronger profitability , forecasting a 33% margin for Q2 and reaffirming their full-year target of 29% .The top-line outlook was also upgraded. Netflix now expects full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion , up from previous guidance and above consensus estimates .This reflects not only price increases and membership growth but also a sharp uptick in ad revenue , which the company says will roughly double in 2025.Subscriber growth was another standout.Netflix added 18.91 million net new subscribers in the quarter, blowing away expectations of 9.18 million . It was the highest quarterly net addition in company history, showing the platform is still gaining traction despite rising competition and market maturity.2. Wall Street Is Getting Louder [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Following that blowout report, analysts have begun to revise their targets higher. Last week, Wolfe Research reiterated its bullish stance and issued a new price target of $1,340. This echoed the call from Robert Baird who lifted its target to $1,300 , while Canaccord Genuity Group went even further, calling for $1,380 .Those targets imply more than 15% upside from where the stock closed on Monday. That’s a significant projection for a company of Netflix’s size, especially after such a strong run. It also shows that many believe this is not the top but rather a new baseline from which the next leg higher can form.These bullish forecasts are backed by Netflix’s ability to monetize its subscriber base through pricing, premium content, and a fast-growing ad business. With record subscriber growth and rising profitability, the company is executing at a level few of the tech giants can match.Why One Major Firm Just Turned CautiousEven with Netflix firing on all cylinders, some analysts are beginning to voice caution, not about the business, but the stock’s near-term setup. On Monday, J.P. Morgan  downgraded Netflix to Neutral from Overweight , citing a more balanced risk/reward profile following the stock’s significant rally.With shares hitting all-time highs and trading at roughly 39x 2026 earnings and 44x free cash flow , the valuation has started to limit the upside in the short term.The firm still sees Netflix as a long-term leader in global streaming, driven by top-tier content, accelerating profitability, and a dominant position in the shift away from linear TV. But with macro conditions improving and market risk appetite broadening, the team there expects some capital rotation away from defensive names like Netflix toward more beaten-down sectors.What to Watch in the Weeks AheadThey also noted that following recent events like the company’s  Upfront presentation , Netflix may face a quieter period on the catalyst front as it heads into summer, even with strong Q3 content on deck .Still, the structural bull case remains intact . Netflix’s ability to scale globally, grow advertising revenue, and retain its content advantage means pullbacks should be seen in context: as a natural pause in a longer-term uptrend , not a reversal.

'Sesame Street' Finds a New Home on Netflix — WSJ,1747679640000,"By Joseph De AvilaElmo and Cookie Monster are heading to Netflix.The streaming giant has reached an agreement to broadcast new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" giving the beloved children's show a home after Warner Bros. Discovery said it was stepping away from the program.The agreement, which begins with the upcoming 56th season, includes 90 hours of previous episodes. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization that produces ""Sesame Street, "" said new episodes will also air on PBS stations and PBS Kids the same day they debut on Netflix. PBS has broadcast ""Sesame Street"" for over 50 years. Under its previous deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, PBS could only show new episodes months after they aired on HBO.The deal serves ""as a unique public-private partnership to enable 'Sesame Street' to continue to help children everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder,"" Sesame Workshop said.Warner Bros. Discovery said in December it wouldn't renew its deal with Sesame Workshop to air new episodes of ""Sesame Street,"" leaving the show in limbo. The show began airing on HBO in 2016, before moving to HBO's streaming service in 2020. Warner Bros. Discovery will retain rights to the Sesame Street library through 2027.Sesame Workshop, which generates the majority of its revenue through licensing and distribution fees and royalties, has struggled financially in recent months. In March, Sesame Workshop's CEO told staff it would ""downsize significantly,"" citing the end of the HBO deal and the loss of federal funds as factors.Public media has been under fire of late, with President Trump seeking to end federal funding for PBS and National Public Radio. In his executive order signed earlier this month, Trump said ""neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.""One of the longest-running shows on television, ""Sesame Street"" has aired more than 4,500 episodes since its debut in 1969. Since its inception, Sesame Street has focused on both entertaining and educating children.Major streaming services have changed their approach to children's entertainment in recent years, as they try to compete with YouTube. With ""Sesame Street,"" Netflix adds to its roster of children's programming that already includes ""Peppa Pig,"" ""Cocomelon,"" and ""Ms. Rachel.""The new episodes on Netflix will feature new segments and some format changes, including 11-minute, character-driven stories. There will be a new animated segment called ""Tales from 123"" about the apartment building where Elmo and Cookie Monster live.Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250519005919:0/
"For Netflix, the Mere Threat of Tariffs is Bad Enough — Heard on the Street — WSJ",1746474240000,"By Dan GallagherWall Street sees President Trump's ""Hollywood Tariffs"" as unlikely. But Netflix wasn't even priced for the possibility.The streaming giant's share price was down a little over 1% by Monday afternoon. That's an improvement over the stock's 4% drop around the day's opening bell, which followed Trump announcing a plan for 100% tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands."" The announcement hit movie stocks across the board.Trump's announcement-made over his Truth Social network-was scant on details. But some analysts so far are skeptical. ""We think the Trump administration will face tremendous pushback,"" wrote Michael Pachter of Wedbush in a note to clients. Doug Creutz of TD Cowen described the tariffs as ""politically charged, logistically challenging, and ultimately unlikely to advance meaningfully"" in his own report.But unlike traditional media stocks that have mostly been in a slump this year, Netflix shares have been flying high. The stock was mostly unscathed by Trump's initial tariff announcements in early April, due to the belief that subscription-based streaming services like Netflix and Spotify would be largely immune to the effects of such measures. Netflix shares also got an additional boost from a strong first-quarter report on April 17.All told, Netflix was up 30% for the year by the end of last week, compared to a 4% drop for the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Group. That run had put Netflix shares to a multiple of about 42 times projected earnings-40% higher than what the stock was fetching a year ago and nearly triple Disney's multiple.In a report Monday, Jason Bazinet of Citigroup estimated a ""worst-case"" of about $3 billion a year in additional costs to Netflix from the tariffs Trump outlined, but added that the company ""has a range of options at its disposal to limit the impact."" Still, he noted that the idea of Netflix as a ""safe haven"" from tariffs is now under threat. Even safe havens have their price.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

Netflix Could Get a Boost From Live Events. J.P. Morgan Downgraded It Anyway. — Barrons.com,1747674660000,"By Angela PalumboNetflix shares could continue to shine if the streaming company keeps hosting sporting events, but that didn't stop one J.P. Morgan analyst from downgrading the stock on Monday.Doug Anmuth downgraded the shares to Neutral from Overweight while also raising his price target to $1,220 from $1,150.""To be clear, there's no change to our long-term bullish view on NFLX's streaming leadership position & the company's potential to effectively become global TV over time,"" Anmuth wrote in a research note on Monday. ""However, more near-term, following significant stock price appreciation & outperformance, we believe the risk/reward in NFLX shares is becoming more balanced.""Shares of Netflix were down 0.6% on Monday to $1,184.75. The stock has surged 33% this year, far outperforming the 1% increase of the S&P 500 in 2025.Wall Street hasn't only been pleased with Netflix's performance over the last few quarters, but is also confident it can withstand economic turmoil.Netflix has been performing well because of the company's decision to crack down on password sharing and introduce a lower-price ad tier. The changes led to more people opening their own accounts and provided users with a cheaper option, which could prevent subscription cancellations if times get tough. Netflix has also introduced live events to its streaming platform, including comedy roasts and NFL games.""Live events/sports content could also drive strong engagement, ad dollars, & subscriber growth,"" Anmuth wrote.Netflix is hosting two NFL games on Christmas again this year. The 2024 Christmas games were the two most streamed NFL games in U.S. history, according to Netflix.A CNBC reporter also said on The Town podcast May 16 that he spoke to one of the co-CEOs of Netflix who ""admitted to me, like, 'Yeah, I talked to [NFL commissioner] Roger Goodell on the side about adding even more games beyond our two Christmas games.'""Barron's has reached out to Netflix and the NFL for comment.But while Netflix investors may be excited about the idea of the company hosting more live events down the line, there are still risks to the stock.President Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on movies coming into the country ""that are produced in Foreign Lands.""There aren't many details, but increased costs could hurt margins and potentially push Netflix to raise prices. Netflix is also at risk of people trading down to lower-priced subscription offerings or canceling if tariffs take a bite out of their budgets. Data from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment fell to its second-lowest reading on record in May.Investors will have to decide whether to follow Anmuth's advice and wait on the sidelines, or bet on a streaming service that continues to outperform.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Why Netflix Is the ""Cleanest Story in Tech""",1745325900000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX delivered a convincing performance in its first-quarter 2025 earnings report on Apr. 17, surpassing analyst expectations on key financial metrics and offering a confident outlook for the coming quarter.The strong results provided fresh evidence for a narrative gaining traction that  Netflix represents a uniquely resilient growth story within a technology sector that is currently grappling with economic uncertainty and trade tariff anxieties.As competitors may struggle to maintain momentum, Netflix’s sustained subscriber growth and expanding profitability continue to set it apart.Earnings Show Record Margins and Strong GrowthNetflix's financial results for the first quarter showed strong growth and increased profitability. Revenue rose 12.5% year over year (16% on a foreign exchange-neutral basis) to $10.54 billion, slightly exceeding Netflix’s analyst community’s consensus estimate of $10.51 billion.Operating income increased by 27%, reaching $3.35 billion, which resulted in a record-high operating margin of 31.7%, up from 28.1% in Q1 2024. This demonstrates successful cost management and scaling benefits.Netflix expects continued momentum in the second quarter of 2025, forecasting $11.04 billion in revenue (15% year-over-year growth, or 17% on a foreign exchange-neutral basis) and a potential record operating margin of 33.3%, with diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) expected to be $7.03. The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, targeting revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and a 29% operating margin.During the earnings call, management noted that the company was tracking above the midpoint of its full-year revenue guidance range based on more recent currency rates. At the same time, free cash flow for the year is still expected to be approximately $8 billion.The ""Defensive Edge"": Dodging the Tariff FalloutFollowing strong Q1 results, analysts are increasingly highlighting Netflix's ""defensive"" qualities within the tech sector. JPMorgan NYSE:JPM , for instance, reaffirmed its view, suggesting Netflix could be the ""cleanest story in internet tech"" due to several fundamental aspects of its business that seem to shield it from trade tariffs and broader economic concerns affecting other industries.Unlike hardware companies with intricate global supply chains that are vulnerable to import taxes, Netflix operates mainly as a global digital service. Its revenue, derived from subscriptions and advertising, isn't directly impacted by tariffs on physical goods. Moreover, with most revenue coming from outside the U.S. and no operations in China, Netflix benefits from substantial geographic diversification, lessening risks tied to any single economy or trade conflict.The subscription model, especially with the introduction of a lower-cost ad-supported option, is seen as relatively stable compared to businesses heavily dependent on large, non-essential consumer purchases (such as electronics) or platforms relying solely on potentially fluctuating advertising budgets.During the Q1 earnings call , Netflix management stated that they haven't observed any significant adverse effects on subscriber retention, cancellations, or plan choices due to recent price hikes or wider economic uncertainty. Co-CEO Greg Peters also highlighted the historical resilience of entertainment spending during economic downturns. This perceived stability contrasts sharply with the challenges faced by many other tech companies.Growth Engines Firing on All Cylinders [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix's strong financial performance is strategically driven through several key initiatives. Their entry into advertising, particularly the ad-supported tier, is a significant growth engine, attracting new subscribers (over 55% of new sign-ups in ad markets during Q4 2024) and experiencing rapid membership growth (nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q4'24).Netflix aims to further monetize this with the launch of ""Netflix Ads Suite,"" which began in the US on Apr. 1 and will expand to other ad markets in 2025. This service offers enhanced targeting and measurement for advertisers and will boost this high-profit revenue stream.The ""paid sharing"" initiative, addressing password sharing, has successfully converted non-paying viewers into subscribers or new account holders, significantly increasing revenue and contributing to record global paid net additions in 2024.These monetization strategies are built upon Netflix's extensive and diverse content library. The company's significant investment in original productions across genres and languages for a global audience remains central. Beyond streaming, Netflix is evolving its gaming strategy, concentrating on key genres, utilizing its intellectual property, and exploring cloud gaming. Experiential ventures like ""Netflix Bites"" and the planned ""Netflix House"" locations indicate a focus on strengthening direct-to-consumer engagement and creating new revenue opportunities.Why Experts Remain Positive on NetflixFollowing Netflix's Q1 earnings report, the financial community expressed strong confidence in the company, and analyst sentiment became even more bullish. Data compiled around Apr. 21 from 36 analysts covering the stock showed a consensus rating of Moderate Buy , with 28 of them maintaining Buy or Strong Buy ratings.Strong institutional backing also supports the bullish stance, with large institutional investors holding approximately 81% of Netflix stock. While insider selling activity has occurred over the last year, it is typical for executives to diversify holdings after significant stock appreciation.Despite its premium valuation, reflected in a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 50 , analysts and investors appear willing to pay the multiple. That’s largely due to the company’s strong fundamentals: demonstrated earnings power, projected future growth, consistent margin expansion, solid free cash flow generation, a dominant market position, and notable resilience in the current economic climate.Netflix Remains a Tech Sector StandoutNetflix's Q1 2025 results solidify its leadership position, showcasing strong financial performance and effective execution across key areas like advertising, paid sharing, and content.Notably, the company has demonstrated resilience against macroeconomic challenges impacting the tech sector. This success has garnered overwhelmingly positive response from Wall Street, with raised price targets and reinforced Buy ratings .The market's confidence in Netflix's ability to navigate uncertainty and sustain profitable growth makes it a compelling investment opportunity in the current market.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:0de9c27c6094b:0-why-netflix-is-the-cleanest-story-in-tech/

Wall Street retreats as Moody’s credit downgrade rattles bond and equity markets,1747663651000,"U.S. stocks opened the week on a shaky note, retreating sharply on Monday after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing rising fiscal risks. The move triggered a surge in Treasury yields and weighed heavily on equity sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed, shedding 0.9 percent as growth stocks bore the brunt of the bond market's reaction.Also read: Large private banks, PSUs, NBFCs or MFIs: Which lender to bet on?Moody’s cut the country’s long-term issuer rating by one notch to Aa1, bringing it in line with S&P and Fitch. The downgrade reflects concerns over the government’s ballooning deficit and the cost of refinancing debt in an environment of elevated interest rates.The announcement sparked a selloff in bonds, pushing yields to levels last seen during previous market stress episodes. The 30-year yield breached 5 percent, while the 10-year climbed past 4.5 percent—both benchmarks that investors closely track for their impact on borrowing costs, from mortgages to auto loans.Tech names, which are typically more sensitive to interest rate volatility, led Monday’s slide. Tesla dropped 4 percent, Palantir fell 3 percent, and Nvidia eased 2 percent.

Investors had cheered a breakthrough in trade negotiations, with the U.S. and China agreeing to pause tariff hikes, lifting global risk appetite. The Nasdaq had rallied over 7 percent last week, while the S&P 500 gained more than 5 percent over five straight sessions. The Dow added over 3 percent, entering positive territory for the year after a 300-point surge on Friday.But with bond yields back on the rise, the path forward for equities may hinge on how trade diplomacy evolves and whether market participants can stomach further volatility in interest rates.Beyond macro jitters, stock-specific developments added to the cautious tone.

Should Investors Buy the Spike in Netflix Stock After Q1 Earnings? ,1745267220000,"Netflix NFLX shares had spiked +3% in this morning's trading session as the streaming giant was able to impressively surpass its Q1 earnings expectations before the Easter Holiday last Thursday. This comes as the broader market has experienced another selloff following the extended holiday weekend, with President Trump's tariffs and his bashing of Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates in focus.Netflix’s Q1 ResultsNetflix’s Q1 earnings came in at $2.89 billion or $6.61 a share, surpassing EPS expectations of $5.69 by 16% and climbing 25% from $5.28 per share a year ago on net income of $2.33 billion. Year over year, Q1 sales rose over 12% to $10.54 billion, although this slightly missed the Zacks Consensus by 0.04%.Notably, Netflix attributed the favorable quarterly results to its successful subscription plans and advertising revenue. It’s also noteworthy that Netflix will no longer provide quarterly subscriber data as the company shifts its focus to revenue growth, among other financial metrics and performance indicators. That said, Netflix has exceeded sales estimates in three of its last four quarterly reports and has surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for five consecutive quarters. Netflix’s Positive GuidanceLooking ahead, Netflix expects Q2 sales at $11 billion which came in above Zacks estimates of $10.96 billion or 14% growth (Current Qtr below). More reassuring is that Netflix expects Q2 EPS at $7.03 and above the current Zacks Consensus of $6.22 per share or 27% growth.Furthermore, Netflix still projects full-year revenue between $43.5 billion-$44.5 billion, which falls in range with Zacks projections of $44.4 billion or 14% growth. Based on Zacks estimates, Netflix’s top line is projected to expand another 11% in fiscal 2026 to $49.44 billion.Why NFLX has been a Defensive HedgePiggybacking on Netflix’s successful subscription plans, analysts have pointed out that the streaming king may be able to sustain and even grow its subscriber base amid economic uncertainty, thanks to its more affordable ad-supported plan, which is offered at $7.99 a month. Optimistically, the ad-supported plan should help the notion of ""Netflix and Chill"" if consumers need to save on dining out or other entertainment expenses. Correlating with such optimism, Netflix stock is up +11% year to date compared to the benchmark S&P 500’s 10% decline and the Nasdaq’s -18%. More impressive, over the last two years, NFLX has skyrocketed +200% to largely outperform the broader index’s returns of roughly +30%.Monitoring Netflix’s P/E ValuationTrading around $1000 a share, Netflix stock is at a 39.7X forward earnings multiple. While this is a premium to the benchmark's 20.3X and its main streaming competitor Disney’s DIS 15.5X, NFLX does trade at a significant discount to its five-year high of 88.5X forward earnings and is closer to the median of 37.3X during this period.Bottom LineFor now, Netflix stock lands a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). However, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way, given Netflix’s favorable Q1 report and guidance. To that point, earnings estimate revisions may rise in the coming weeks, which would be indicative of more short-term upside and help level Netflix’s P/E valuation if an extended rally from its current levels hasn’t already continued.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:71064366d094b:0-should-investors-buy-the-spike-in-netflix-stock-after-q1-earnings/

They also say Netflix has been a defensive play, and that as tariff concerns ease, investors may rotate into other Internet names. In addition, they say the near-term catalyst path may be quieter over the slower summer months. But the analysts also raise the price target to $1,220.00 from $1,150.00.

"Media, Streaming Stocks Fall as Trump Proposes 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Made Movies",1746464371000,"Shares of major media, streaming and television companies were down Monday after US President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff rate on foreign-produced films, with Wedbush Securities saying that Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD and Paramount Global NASDAQ:PARA are among the companies that face a ""significant amount"" of risk. In a social media post Sunday, Trump said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and the US Trade Representative to immediately start the process of imposing 100% duties on ""any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands."" Other nations are offering ""all sorts of incentives"" to pull American filmmakers and studios away from the US, thus impacting Hollywood, he said. Shares of Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX declined 2.1% in Monday afternoon trade, while Disney edged down 0.4%. Warner Bros decreased 1.2%, Paramount fell 1.1% and Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA nudged 0.2% lower. Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN , which owns the Amazon Prime streaming service, was down 1.6%. ""We think the large studios and distributors including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount, Comcast/NBC Universal, Lionsgate, and Sony TSE:6758 , and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" Wedbush analysts, including Alicia Reese, said in a Monday note to clients. As long as there's some production in the US, a tariff could likely be avoided or minimized, the analysts said. The Motion Picture Association of America didn't immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment. Trump's move is likely to draw a ""tremendous pushback,"" initially from other countries that may impose tariffs or announce an outright ban on US-produced content, and eventually from Congress, according to Wedbush. The brokerage said it's currently not clear if Trump's proposed tariffs will apply to ticket sales or the entire value chain, including streaming. In the near term, studios can shift some portion of their production to the US with logistical adjustments and higher tax rates, unless cities offer ""similar"" tax relief as the foreign territories provided, Wedbush said. The brokerage assumed that 75% of Netflix's overall content is produced overseas, with foreign language content all international and a ""large percentage"" of domestic production moved to the UK and Canada for cost savings. The streaming giant has ""little control"" over where the vast majority of its content is produced, according to the note. Wedbush said it's is unsure if the tariffs will apply to Netflix's already-produced content or newly produced projects. ""Despite the headline risk, we maintain that Netflix is positioned to accelerate ad-tier revenue contribution for the next several years by adding live events, improving its advertising solutions and targeting, and broadening its content strategy,"" the analysts said.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250505:A3369439:0/

Netflix Targets $1 Trillion Valuation by 2030 With Big Plans for Growth,1745265003000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) is setting an ambitious goal to double its revenue and triple its operating profit over the next five years as it works toward reaching a $1 trillion market value.The streaming giant is betting that growth in both subscriptions and advertising will help it get there. Netflix aims to build its ad business to $9 billion a year by 2030, adding a second major revenue stream alongside its core paid memberships. If successful, Netflix would join Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) among the few companies that have crossed the trillion-dollar mark.Executives outlined the plan earlier this year, shortly after co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos attended events tied to the entertainment industrys biggest night, the Oscars. Despite broader economic uncertainty and fears of a potential recession, leadership and investors are expressing confidence in the companys long-term outlook.At the start of April, Netflixs market value was around $260 billion, leaving a significant gap to close. The company is counting on international expansion, a stronger content lineup, and growth in its ad-supported plans to drive the next phase of its business.While Netflix faces tough competition from Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and others, it is betting that a more diversified business model will help it weather economic pressures and stay on track toward its $1 trillion goal.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:f24c2d9e5094b:0-netflix-targets-1-trillion-valuation-by-2030-with-big-plans-for-growth/
"JPMorgan cuts Netflix rating, citing balanced risk-reward post-rally; stock falls",1747653114000,"Shares of Netflix fell over 2.3% in premarket trading Monday after JPMorgan downgraded the streaming giant to “neutral” from “overweight”, even as it raised its price target on the stock to $1,220 from $1,150. The new target implies a modest 2.38% upside from the company’s last close at $1,191.53. The company has also removed Netflix from the US Equity Analyst Focus List, it said.The downgrade comes despite JPMorgan reiterating its belief in Netflix’s long-term leadership in the global streaming industry and its potential to effectively become the world’s dominant TV platform. Few near-term catalysts; easing trade fears could shift focus: JPMorganNetflix shares have surged more than 34% so far in 2025, outperforming the broader S&P 500 Movies & Entertainment index, which has risen 20.87%. The stock also recently crossed the $500 billion market capitalization mark for the first time, underscoring investor confidence in the company’s business model and growth potential.However, the brokerage said the stock’s significant rally over recent months has made the risk/reward outlook more evenly balanced in the near term.Analysts said the sharp gains likely reflect much of the upside embedded in the company’s 2025 earnings guidance. As a result, they see limited near-term catalysts to drive the stock substantially higher.It also said that while the company’s shares have held up well, if concerns about tariffs and the broader economy continue to ease, investors may shift their focus to other internet stocks and market sectors that have been more vulnerable & pressured.A safe haven in a volatile marketNetflix’s recent stock gains have been attributed to its perceived immunity from tariff threats and economic uncertainty. The company imports entertainment, not physical goods, insulating it from the cost pressures that have hit other firms amid escalating trade tensions. Even when former President Donald Trump floated a 100% import duty on foreign films, Netflix stock fell just 2% as investors bet the company could adjust by shifting production to the US or raising subscription prices.Moreover, Netflix has historically performed well during periods of economic stress. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it posted double-digit gains as homebound users streamed popular titles.That history has made it a preferred choice among investors seeking stability.According to data compiled by LSEG, the average rating of 51 analysts on Netflix is a “buy”, with a median PT of $1,150.Valuation concerns begin to surfaceAt around 43 times forward earnings, Netflix’s valuation has become a topic of concern. It trades at a premium compared to the S&P 500’s multiple of 21 and even the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants, which average 27.However, the company has historically commanded a higher premium. Its average P/E ratio over the past five years stands at 52.Ben James, a strategist at Baillie Gifford’s US growth fund, told Barron’s that the stock’s transformation from a speculative content spender to a profitable business has justified its valuation. The firm, which owns roughly 4 million Netflix shares valued at $4.5 billion, remains optimistic that operating margins could nearly double from the current 27% to as high as 50% by 2030.“It’s invested so much in its own content that it’s built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,” James said. “When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it’s over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.”Looking ahead to 2030Executives are reportedly targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of the decade, according to The Wall Street Journal . While the company has surpassed the critical $500 billion mark, the it will need to sustain rapid earnings growth and margin expansion to hit that milestone. While short-term valuations may limit further gains, many investors remain focused on the long-term narrative that Netflix will continue to shape the future of global entertainment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:eeb6d554c094b:0-jpmorgan-cuts-netflix-rating-citing-balanced-risk-reward-post-rally-stock-falls/

""Management noted that, given its current positioning within the advertising industry, it provides them with 'some insulation' as the ad market appears to be weakening.""MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman said Netflix offers additional profit growth potential based on the reaction to higher costs for some subscribers.""When looking at U.S. revenue per hour viewed, Netflix still appears to be underearning relative to its engagement and even after the recent price increases still has a consumer surplus to further raise prices,"" Fishman said.Some risks do remain, such as the cost of making the programming and the threat of competition, analysts said.Netflix's stock has gained 75% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX has gained 6.4%.-Steve GelsiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

PLTR, Netflix NFLX, Quanta Services Inc . PWR, GE Vernova GEV and DexCom Inc. DXCM. Increasing hopes of a U.S. trade deal with major trading partners and solid corporate earnings buoyed sentiment. Here are the key drivers that are driving the stock market higher in recent weeks and will continue to do so:Easing Trade TensionsSeveral reports suggest that the United States and China are willing to negotiate on tariffs and put an end to the trade conflict. Chinese officials have signaled reopening trade talks with Washington, while President Trump on Sunday said he wants a ""fair deal"" with China.Robust Earnings ReportsStrong quarterly earnings reports from software giant Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) spread strong optimism in the tech sector. The dual earnings outperformance underscores that strong demand for AI is helping both companies navigate tariff-driven economic uncertainty (read: AAI ETFs Set to Gain on Robust Meta, Microsoft Earnings). Encouraging Jobs ReportApril jobs data show that the U.S. labor market remained resilient amid the tariff chaos.

"Apple Shares Dip 21% Year to Date: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745262000000,"Apple AAPL shares have declined 21.3% year to date (YTD) underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decline of 17.1%. The stock has suffered from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. Post the April 2 Liberation Day announcement, Apple shares had fallen 11.2% till April 9 when the 90-day pause was announced. Since then, Apple shares have recovered 3.4% to date.China is an important market for Apple as the iPhone maker’s manufacturing is primarily concentrated in the country. Higher tariffs negatively impact Apple’s China supply chain. The Trump administration’s decision to exempt electronic devices like smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs provided some relief to Apple. Apple has also been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone in China amid increasing competition from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. Greater China sales decreased 11.1% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.Apple Stock YTD Performance  Can Strong Services Boost Apple’s Prospects?Although Apple’s business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s strong growth driver. In the fiscal first quarter, Services revenues grew 14% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.However, Apple TV+ has been suffering from a lack of content compared to Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN and Disney DIS. Severance , along with Ted Lasso , Slow Horses and Silo , are a few of the Apple TV+ shows that have gained fame in recent years. The number is quite small compared with content offerings from bigger rivals, including Netflix, Amazon and Disney. Apple TV+’s low popularity is hurting profitability, with the service losing more than $1 billion per The Information, which also claimed that the platform had roughly 45 million subscribers in 2024.Per the latest data from JustWatch cited by 9TO5Mac, Apple TV+’s market share in the United States has increased from 7% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to 8% in the first quarter of 2025. Amazon Prime Video continued to lead with 21% market share, trailed by Netflix at 20%, Max at 13%, and Disney+ at 12%.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost iPhone Sales GrowthAlthough iPhone sales decreased 0.8% year over year to $69.14 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024. Apple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India — and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world.Apple iPhone and iPad users in the European Union can now access Apple Intelligence features. Apple Vision Pro now features Apple Intelligence in U.S. English.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 1.1% to $7.18 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 6.37% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple Inc. Stock Price and ConsensusApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. QuoteApple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.39%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Apple Stock OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.85X compared with the sector’s 23.92X, reflecting a stretched valuation.Price/Earnings Ratio (Forward 12 Months)AAPL shares are now trading below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Trades Below 50-day & 200-day SMAs  ConclusionAlthough the Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow, we believe Apple Intelligence’s underwhelming performance is a headwind for its product business (iPhone, iPad and Mac). Hence, we believe that Apple’s near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Netflix Stock Is Still A Buy Despite Its Lofty Valuation — Barron's,1747445400000,"The shares were a tariff winner, and that won't change even with the China trade deal. By George GloverIn a market that has felt like a horror show for much of 2025, Netflix has been one of the few feel-good stories in town.The video streamer looks like the rare sort of stock that can outperform no matter what happens on the trade front. Its shares, at a recent $1,173.25, have jumped 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a brutal and broad selloff, while the S&P 500 index is up 4.1% over the same period. On Thursday, Netflix was less than $1 billion away from closing with a market value of $500 billion for the first time.It isn't hard to see why Netflix has become one of the market's go-to safe havens. It imports content, not goods, so there's little risk of the White House's reciprocal levies driving up its costs. Shares dipped just 2% the day Trump threatened to impose 100% import duties on foreign movies, as investors realized that the company could mitigate much of the earnings impact by either shifting production to the U.S. or raising its prices.The stock also has a pedigree as a name that can outperform in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, racking up double-digit gains during the Covid-19 pandemic as widespread lockdowns led to users plowing through smash-hit series like Tiger King and The Last Dance.But while other perceived havens like gold could struggle now that the Trump administration has brokered a deal with China to cut most tariffs for 90 days, Netflix ought to be able to build on its strong run this year.The only real mark against the stock right now is valuation. Due to the recent rally, shares aren't cheap — they currently fetch about 43 times future earnings, meaning they're trading at a significant premium to both the benchmark S&P 500, at 21 times, and the Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech names it's often compared with, at 27 times.Still, Netflix has averaged a price/earnings ratio of 52 over the past five years, so judging by recent history it isn't expensive. Over that time the stock has gone from ""a loss-making challenger where everyone was skeptical about how much it's spending on content to a reliable, profitable compounder,"" Ben James, a strategist at the Edinburgh-based investment management firm Baillie Gifford's U.S. growth fund, tells Barron's. The firm holds a little more than 4 million shares, a position that's valued at about $4.5 billion.The bull case hinges on the idea that the streamer will be able to grow earnings at a fast enough rate to maintain the stock's recent momentum. James argues that operating margins, currently at 27%, could nearly double by the end of 2030.He says that over the past decade, Netflix has managed to engineer a self-sustaining cycle of growth in which more subscribers means more money to spend on content, which in turn attracts even more users. The streamer has already done the hard work, pouring money into creating a vast library of films and movies.""It's invested so much in its own content that it's built a flywheel that will be key to growing its margins,"" James says. ""When we first invested in 2015, its margins were about 4.5%, and our forecast was they would reach 50% within 10 to 15 years. So it's over halfway there, and we still think it can get there.""Executives are targeting a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, up from $484 billion right now. Even at Netflix's current lofty valuation, it would be all set to hit the 13-figure threshold if it could manage the necessary margin growth.The rollout of cheaper subscription plans could also help supercharge profit. Netflix unlocked a fresh revenue stream when it introduced ad-supported tiers in November 2022. Ads accounted for just 4% of revenue in 2024, but the company projects ad revenue to double this year, and its advertising president, Amy Reinhard, said Wednesday that the ad-supported tiers had added 24 million users over the past six months. James thinks the streamer will soon be able to leverage artificial intelligence to target users and make the tiers more profitable.Live sports programming could also help the streamer reach untapped markets. It might seem like every household has a Netflix account, but there's still plenty of room for the streamer to grow. For the fourth quarter of 2024, it reported 301.6 million subscribers globally. Three years ago, Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann estimated a total addressable market of between 700 million and 1 billion homes.Netflix might not even be a pure-play streamer for much longer. In February the company opened its first restaurant, Netflix Bites in Las Vegas, where fans can tuck into dishes inspired by well-known films and TV shows. It's also set to launch two experiential venues it's dubbed Netflix Houses sometime later this year.All that makes for a tempting growth story. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to rise 26% this year, another 20% in 2026, and then another 18% in 2027.Despite Netflix's stellar gains this year, investors shouldn't feel like they've missed the boat. Surging profit could quickly make the streamer look cheap again. Sometimes it's worth paying a premium for that.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515000044:0/
"Tariff News: A Trade Deal May Come This Week, Report Says — Barrons.com",1746450780000,"By Brian SwintPresident Donald Trump is hoping to pin down at least one trade deal with a country trying to lower tariffs against it before the end of the week, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unidentified senior administration official.That would be a milestone as the deadline for higher tariffs to take effect in July approaches. Trump is looking for agreements from trading partners to buy more U.S. goods and reduce non-tariff barriers. The president has also said that the current 145% levy on Chinese imports will eventually come down.At the same time, administration officials are feeling more confident about the economic outlook, the report said. That follows a strong nonfarm payrolls report from April on Friday. Congress is this week turning its attention to a tax and spending bill that could bolster growth.Nevertheless, Trump said a downturn was still possible in a television interview on Sunday. ""Anything can happen,"" he told NBC's Meet the Press when asked if the country would fall into recession.Here's the latest on tariffs.Foxconn Sales JumpHon Hai Precision Industry Co, the company also known as Foxconn that assembles iPhones for Apple, said sales jumped 26% in April as clients rushed to make orders before tariffs come into effect. Revenue in the first four months of the year was the best on record.Apple, which is Foxconn's biggest customer, said last week that it expects tariffs to add $900 million to costs in the June quarter. It is planning on moving production of iPhones for sale in the U.S. to India and Vietnam, rather than China.Foxconn also boasts Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Sony as clients.Movies TargetedTrump said in a Truth Social post that he is putting a 100% tariff on movies produced in other countries.

Trump tariff order on movies leaves film industry flummoxed,1746449860000,"The entertainment industry reacted with alarm and bafflement on Monday after President Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., but issued few details on just how such a levy would work.Veteran studio executives who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity said the announcement on Sunday left unanswered the timing of the proposed levy and how it would be enforced for an industry whose biggest-budget films are often produced across several continents. Trump's pronouncement followed his meeting at Mar-a-Lago with his Hollywood ambassador, actor Jon Voight, special advisor Steven Paul and media executive Scott Karol. The group mulled a range of ideas to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives, tax code changes and imposing tariffs ""in certain limited circumstances,"" the group said in a statement. Slapping levies on an industry like film would mark a major extension of tariffs as a policy tool into services, for which the U.S. runs a sizable trade surplus. And like the auto , pharmaceutical and chip industries before it, Trump's declaration threatens to put another business in a tariff-induced state of limbo. The industry has been pressing for tax incentives to boost output in Los Angeles, the movie industry's glitzy historic hub of cinema, as studios have shifted production to locations such as the UK, Canada and Australia to take advantage of generous tax credits and lower labor costs. A survey among studio executives over their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 by ProdPro showed the top five choices were all elsewhere. The White House's trade policy is aimed at boosting U.S. industrial activity, but the series of levies and rollbacks has sapped consumer and business confidence.Tariffs on movies might prove particularly hard to implement.One studio executive compared movie production to auto manufacturing, with various pieces - filming, visual effects and other elements - completed around the world, then assembled, through post-production, in the U.S. Some executives wondered whether the levy would apply only to the work done elsewhere, or attach to projects jointly financed by foreign investors. Producer Todd Garner said proposed tariffs could have the unintended consequence of stymieing creativity. He cited director Steven Spielberg's acclaimed World War II epic on the invasion of Normandy, France, ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""How would you make 'Saving Private Ryan' in the U.S.? In Shreveport?"" Garner said from Australia, where he is filming the action-drama 'Runner.' ""Or a globe-trotting 'Mission: Impossible?'"" On Monday, Trump told reporters he would meet with industry officials first to make sure they liked the idea. The White House said it had not made any final decisions, but noted that Hollywood film production had sharply declined from the previous year.The primary union representing actors issued a supportive statement on Monday. SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the union supports efforts to increase domestic movie, television and streaming production and adding jobs for American workers. ""We look forward to learning more about the specifics of the plan announced by the president and to advancing a dialogue to achieve our common goals,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union representing more than 170,000 technicians and craftspeople, called for a balanced federal response that includes tax incentives to help bring jobs back. Any trade policy ""must do no harm to our Canadian members — nor the industry overall,"" said International Alliance President Matthew D. Loeb. IMPLEMENTATION CONFUSIONShares of media companies slipped on Monday. Streaming pioneer Netflix, NASDAQ:NFLX which relies on global operations to produce content for international audiences, posted a 2% decline in its stock. Disney NYSE:DIS and Universal-owner Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA edged lower. Stocks of theater operators such as Cinemark NYSE:CNK and IMAX NYSE:IMAX were down 1.6% and 2%, respectively.IMAX declined to comment, while others did not respond to requests for comment.Entertainment attorney Stephen Weizenecker said producers, financiers and film offices were trying to figure out how tariffs would be implemented, but said it could lead to a notable shift in production back to the United States. ""If you get any sort of significant tariff, 10% or 20%, it takes away whatever production incentive there was for filming outside the United States,"" said Weizenecker, who advises producers and financiers on production incentives. However, traditional enforcement tools, like customs inspections at ports of entry, will not work for movies that are licensed, streamed or distributed on global platforms using a borderless cloud infrastructure, wrote TD Cowen media analyst Doug Creutz. The ""risks to putting digital goods and services on the table in trade negotiations/wars are overwhelmingly tilted against the U.S.,"" he noted. Hollywood brings in most of its box office revenue from overseas. In 2024, about 70% of the roughly $30 billion in global ticket sales came from outside the United States and Canada, said Daniel Loria, senior vice president at The Boxoffice Company.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RD0ND:0-trump-tariff-order-on-movies-leaves-film-industry-flummoxed/"

S&P 500 Achieves a Milestone After Two Decades - 5 Top Picks,1746447840000,"The S&P 500 Index has been able to recoup all losses suffered due to the Trump administration’s tariff-led market mayhem at a lightning speed. On May 2, the broad-market index recorded a nine-day winning streak, for the first time since November 2004. With this, Wall Street’s most observed stock index recovered all losses since April 2, when President Donald Trump announced the imposition of reciprocal tariffs. The index is currently around 7% away from its all-time high recorded in February. During the tariff-led April turmoil, at one point, the S&P 500 was down nearly 20% from its all-time high and was on the verge of entering the bear market zone. In addition, the index also posted two consecutive weeks of a winning run.At this stage, we recommend investing in five S&P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided more than 20% returns year to date. These are: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Newmont Corp. NEM, CenterPoint Energy Inc. CNP and Exelon Corp. EXC. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings growth potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Netflix Inc.Netflix handsomely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for bottom line while the top line was mostly in line with the consensus mark in first-quarter 2025. Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels. NFLX reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.The primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Netflix’s policies of offering an ad-supported lower-priced tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer a high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 27.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.1% over the last 30 days. Philip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris has benefited from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio. PM has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, PM aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.Philip Morris is set for another year of robust growth in 2025, driven by increasing demand across all product categories. PM anticipates positive volume growth for the fifth consecutive year, with an expected increase of 2%. Smoke-free products remain a key growth driver, projected to expand by 12-14%, reinforcing PM’s strategic shift toward reduced-risk alternatives.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.1% and 13.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last 30 days. Newmont Corp.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. NEM is likely to gain from several projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest also created an industry-leading portfolio and provided opportunities for significant synergies. NEM also remains focused on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders.Newmont has received full funds approval for its Ahafo North project and the project has reached the execution stage. Commercial production for the project is expected to commence in second-half 2025. NEM remains committed to Ghana, investing $950 million to $1,050 million in development capital for Ahafo North. Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.1% and 16.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 23.4% over the last 30 days. CenterPoint Energy Inc.CenterPoint Energy is likely to benefit from increasing electricity demand, backed by rapid electrification of transportation amid rising investments in renewable energy. CNP aims to invest substantially in upgrading its infrastructure. Successful returns from these investments should boost CNP’s long-term growth. CNP boasts a solid solvency position.With the rapid electrification of the transportation sector, backed by growing clean energy adoption among industries across the board, the utilization of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased manifold in recent times. To tap the growth benefits of the EV market, CenterPoint Energy has been investing significantly in building a smarter, cleaner and more resilient ecosystem to meet the needs of EV drivers and fleet operators. To this end, CNP has been actively promoting off-road electrification, including electric forklifts and carts.CenterPoint Energy has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 3.4% and 8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Exelon Corp.Exelon’s investment will strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure and help in providing reliable services to customers. EXC’s initiatives in grid modernization will improve the resilience of its operations, and revenue decoupling will mitigate the impact of load fluctuation. A stable cash flow allows EXC to pay out regular dividends. The development of data centers will increase demand. Exelon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 6.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 30 days.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5102ac122094b:0-s-p-500-achieves-a-milestone-after-two-decades-5-top-picks/

Netflix also forecasts its global advertising revenues to grow to $9 billion by 2030.Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division and building its advertising business. With total subscribers of more than 300 million, the company aims to increase this subscriber base to approximately 410 million by 2030 by focusing on international markets, such as India and Brazil, for much of this expansion.Analysts Raise Target Price on NetflixSeveral analysts praised the company’s ability to thrive amid economic uncertainty.

3 Reasons Why Earnings Season Rocks ,1747418400000,"Imagine that, once every few months, you must release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.Sounds intimidating, right?That’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.The period is undoubtedly hectic for market participants, with companies finally revealing what’s transpired behind closed doors.And on top of being hectic, it’s impossible to understate the importance of the period. For those wondering why it’s so critical, let’s look at a few reasons that help explain its significance.1. Critical Business UpdatesEarnings reports provide market participants with a plethora of information, including revenues, expenses, and profits, just to provide a few simple examples.Take, for example, Palantir PLTR, which recently upped its current year revenue growth guidance, causing shares to soar post-earnings. PLTR has communicated that it’s been enjoying healthy demand thanks to the AI frenzy, reflected by the guidance upgrade.Analysts accordingly adjusted their current year sales expectations following the guidance upgrade, with the company now forecasted to see 35% YoY revenue growth.2. Share Price ImpactA company’s quarterly earnings report commonly impacts its stock price, a theme that market participants have undoubtedly noticed. Typically, we’ll see bullish share movement post-earnings from companies that surprise positively or raise their guidance, reflecting healthy underlying business.Netflix NFLX saw its shares soar following its latest quarterly print, with the company crushing on subscriber metrics while also posting 25% EPS growth on the back of 12% higher sales. As shown below, shares have soared following back-to-back releases.It’s worth noting that implementing a stop-loss at a comfortable threshold will help limit spooky post-earnings price swings, preserving precious capital.3. Highlights Current TrendsEarnings season can also provide a big-picture view of overall trends within the economy or industries. For a simple example, if many retail companies fall short of expectations, it could be a sign of a slowing consumer or economy, which has knock-on effects across the market.Conversely, if many retail companies report stronger-than-expected earnings, it may signal that the economy is moving along just fine, underpinned by a healthy consumer.It also allows investors to position themselves appropriately. For example, Newmont NEM, one of the world's largest producers of gold, has benefited significantly from the rise in gold, which was reflected in its latest quarterly print.The average gold price per oz reached $2,643 throughout Newmont’s latest period, melting higher from the $2,004 mark in the same period last year. Free cash flow of $1.6 billion throughout the period was the company’s highest read ever.Analysts have raised their EPS expectations across the board amid the favorable operating environment, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares overall reflect a great way to obtain exposure to the recent run in gold.Bottom LineWhile earnings season is undeniably hectic for everyone involved, that’s just the nature of the period.It’s important for investors to understand why it matters for many reasons, including providing investors with an updated financial standing, the volatile post-earnings share swings, and the overall picture it provides on market and broader trends.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7d5ebe7a7094b:0-3-reasons-why-earnings-season-rocks/
US media stocks fall as Trump threatens 100% tariff on foreign-made films,1746444974000,"American media stocks tumbled on Monday after President Donald Trump unveiled a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., a move that could sharply raise costs for Hollywood studios and rattle the global entertainment industry.Trump's announcement was short on details. It did not say whether the levies will target films on streaming platforms and those shown in theaters, nor did it specify if the tariffs will be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue.Streaming pioneer Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX could particularly be at risk, analysts said, as it relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Its shares fell 4.9% in premarket action, leading a slide in media stocks.Despite Los Angeles' longstanding reputation as the hub of cinema, studios have over the years shifted production overseas to locations such as the UK due to attractive tax breaks and lower costs. None of the 10 best picture contenders for this year's Oscars were filmed in the Californian city.A forced move back to the U.S. would likely drive up production budgets for an industry that now relies on a global supply chain — with shoots in Europe, post-production hubs in Canada and visual effects teams spread across Southeast Asia.Walt Disney Co NYSE:DIS , Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD and Universal-owner Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA were down between 0.8% and 2.7%.""The problem is that pretty much all the studios are moving tons of production overseas to reduce production costs and leverage foreign credits,"" said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett. ""Raising the cost to produce movies could lead studios to make less content. There's also a risk of retaliatory tariffs against American content overseas."" American movies generated $22.6 billion in exports and a trade surplus of $15.3 billion in 2023, according to the American Motion Picture And Television Industry.A survey conducted by ProdPro among studio executives regarding their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026 showed that the top five choices were all outside the U.S.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RD0FS:0-us-media-stocks-fall-as-trump-threatens-100-tariff-on-foreign-made-films/"

"Netflix, Other Movie Stocks Fall After Trump Threatens Tariffs on Foreign-Made Films — WSJ",1746443580000,"By Caitlin McCabeShares of U.S. studios and entertainment companies dropped in premarket trading Monday, after President Trump called for a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas.- Warner Bros. Discovery stock recently stood 2.8% lower. The company is behind this year's highest-grossing film, ""A Minecraft Movie,"" which was partly filmed in New Zealand and Canada. - Netflix shares lost 3.7%. - Shares in Amazon, Walt Disney and Paramount Global all lost 1.5% or more. Amazon owns Amazon MGM Studios.It isn't clear how such tariffs would work, with Trump saying only in a social-media post that he had authorized the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to immediately begin instituting the tariffs ""on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.""The proclamation potentially marks a new phase of Trump's trade war, since movies aren't physical goods that move through ports.Some overseas locales, including London, have become film-making hubs, aided by tax breaks and infrastructure like large soundstages.

"Netflix's Resilient Business Model to Help Buoy 2025 Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says",1745249438000,"Netflix's NASDAQ:NFLX business is expected to be relatively resilient in a challenging economic backdrop, according to Morgan Stanley, which forecasts the streaming giant to record higher revenue for 2025 than previously estimated. The company reported its first-quarter results last week, with membership growth and price increases helping lift overall revenue above market expectations. It outlined a second-quarter revenue outlook of $11.04 billion, above Wall Street's estimates at the time, and maintained its full-year sales guidance at $43.5 billion to $44.5 billion. Netflix is tracking above the mid-point of its full-year guide, Morgan Stanley said in a client note emailed Monday. With foreign exchange now seen as a tailwind, the investment bank estimates the streaming company to report revenue of $44.45 billion for the current year, up from its previous forecast of $44.3 billion. The consensus on FactSet is for sales of $44.42 billion. In a shareholder letter last week, the streamer said its full-year revenue outlook reflected healthy member growth, higher subscription pricing and a ""rough doubling"" of advertising revenue. Morgan Stanley estimates ad revenue to cross $5 billion by 2028 from an estimated $700 million in 2024. The investment bank said that ""2025 is an important year for advertising monetization as Netflix moves from largely leveraging third parties to rolling out its own first-party advertising suite of products.""Netflix said Thursday that it increased prices in France, having recently made pricing adjustments in markets such US, the UK and Argentina. ""These increases are not driving a churn response above historical norms and remain highly revenue and profit accretive,"" the brokerage said. ""This is encouraging in the context of rising anxiety over consumer spending.""Oppenheimer said last week that Netflix has no trade exposure and could even benefit from a potential economic downturn, when consumers tend to stay home more often. Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on Netflix's stock and lifted the price target to $1,200 from $1,150. The brokerage expects Netflix to achieve a compound annual growth rate of more than 20% to 25% in per-share adjusted earnings over the next four years through margin expansion and double-digit revenue gains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250421:A3356416:0/

Netflix Not Seeing Slowdown in Ad Spending — Market Talk,1745249400000,"Netflix reports its not seeing a slowdown or pullback in ad spending despite the cloudy macroeconomic environment, likely because of its appeal as a shiny new home for advertising, Macquarie analyst Ross Compton says in a research note. Fill rates continue to improve, aided by programming rollouts to its major markets, the analyst says. The Ad Suite that Netflix launched on April 1 represents a crucial lever for monetizing the company's advertising platform and should support long-term growth, Compton says. The tool is crucial in Netflix's quest to attract advertisers with granular targeting, programmatic capabilities and measurement, the analyst says.

Netflix vs. Paramount Global: Which Streaming Provider is a Better Buy?,1747401840000,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of entertainment streaming, Netflix NFLX and Paramount Global PARA represent two distinct approaches to capturing audience attention and market share. Netflix, the pioneer that transformed how we consume content, has evolved into a global powerhouse with more than 300 million paid households. Paramount Global, born from the merger of ViacomCBS, combines traditional media assets with streaming ambitions through Paramount+.Both companies are navigating similar challenges: intensifying competition, evolving consumer preferences, and the need to balance content investments with profitability. As streaming becomes the dominant form of entertainment consumption, investors are increasingly scrutinizing which media companies can deliver sustainable growth and returns in this new paradigm.Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.The Case for NFLX StockNetflix has demonstrated remarkable resilience and innovation in the first quarter of 2025, posting impressive results that highlight its dominant position in the streaming wars. Revenues grew 13% year over year to $10.5 billion, while operating income surged 27% to $3.3 billion. This strong performance reflects Netflix's successful execution of its strategic priorities, which include improving content offerings and growing its advertising business.The company's content strategy continues to deliver results, with breakthrough originals like Adolescence , which became the third most popular English-language series ever with 124 million views. Netflix's international expansion is equally impressive, with significant investments in local content production across 50 countries. This global approach has paid dividends, as evidenced by the company's U.K. success, where it has captured 9% of TV viewing time, trailing only BBC and ITV.Netflix's upcoming content pipeline further strengthens its investment case. The second quarter features high-profile films like Nonnas starring Vince Vaughn, Straw with Taraji P. Henson and Havoc featuring Tom Hardy. The highly anticipated final season of Squid Game , Netflix's most popular series ever, debuts on Jun. 27, 2025, accompanied by updates to the related games experience, showcasing Netflix's cross-platform content monetization strategy.Netflix's financial discipline stands out as a particular strength. The company generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow for the first quarter, demonstrating its ability to convert growth into tangible returns for shareholders. Management has also set ambitious but achievable targets, including doubling revenues by 2030 and achieving $9 billion in annual advertising revenues by the same year. The company's advertising business represents a significant growth opportunity, with the successful launch of Netflix's Ad Suite in the United States on April 1 and international expansion planned for this quarter. Management expects advertising revenues to double in 2025, creating a new revenue stream that complements its successful subscription model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $44.47 billion, indicating 14.01% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.33 per share, indicating 27.74% growth year over year. Netflix, Inc. Price and ConsensusNetflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc. QuoteFind the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.The Case for PARA StockParamount Global has been struggling to transform itself amid significant challenges. While the company posted revenues of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, this represented a 6% decline year over year, even when excluding the impact of the prior year's Super Bowl broadcast. The company's TV Media segment, which still accounts for the largest portion of revenues, saw a concerning 13% decrease.Despite reaching 79 million Paramount+ subscribers, the Direct-to-Consumer segment continues to operate at a loss of $109 million. Although this represents an improvement of $177 million year over year, it pales in comparison to Netflix's profitability and scale. Additionally, Paramount+ faces subscriber growth challenges, with management warning about expected subscriber declines in the second quarter due to content seasonality and the termination of an international hard bundle partnership.Paramount Global's content strategy appears unfocused compared with Netflix, spreading investments across traditional broadcast, cable networks, film, and streaming. While the company celebrates shows like Landman and 1923 , it lacks the consistent hit ratio of Netflix. The company also faces monetization challenges with Pluto TV, its free ad-supported service, where increased supply in digital video has pressured advertising revenues.The uncertain Skydance merger further complicates Paramount Global's investment case. Though management confirmed the transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2025, this pending deal creates uncertainty about future strategic direction. Questions also remain about the treatment of voting shareholders in the transaction, as highlighted by recent legal challenges from GAMCO Investors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PARA’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.32 per share, indicating a 14.29% decrease year over year. The consensus estimate for 2025 revenues is pinned at $28.43 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 2.67%.Paramount Global Price and ConsensusParamount Global price-consensus-chart | Paramount Global QuoteStock Valuation and Price Performance ComparisonNetflix currently trades at a premium valuation compared to Paramount Global, but the disparity appears justified given the companies' divergent financial trajectories. Netflix's price-to-earnings ratio of 43.21x reflects investors' confidence in its sustainable growth model, robust free cash flow generation, and clear path to increased profitability. In contrast, PARA's lower valuation multiple of 7.48x signals market skepticism about its ability to successfully navigate the transition to streaming.NFLX vs. PARA: P/E F12M RatioStock performance tells a similar story. Netflix shares have shown strong momentum, trading near all-time highs and significantly outperforming both the broader market and the entertainment sector. Paramount Global shares, meanwhile, have underperformed, weighed down by concerns about linear TV decline, streaming profitability challenges and transaction uncertainty.Shares of NFLX have surged 32.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming PARA and the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.NFLX Outperforms PARA, Sector YTDNetflix's solid balance sheet, with $7.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, provides flexibility for content investments and shareholder returns. Paramount Global, despite generating $123 million in free cash flow in the first quarter, faces greater financial constraints and uncertainty about future capital allocation priorities.ConclusionNetflix emerges as the superior investment choice in the streaming wars based on its robust financial performance, strategic clarity, and execution capabilities. While Paramount struggles with declining legacy businesses and unprofitable streaming operations, Netflix continues to innovate and expand its dominance globally. NFLX's superior content strategy, successful advertising initiatives, and impressive cash flow generation create a compelling investment case. Investors should consider buying Netflix for its long-term growth prospects and potential for increased shareholder returns, while approaching Paramount Global with caution given its structural challenges and uncertain future. In the battle for streaming supremacy, Netflix has established itself as the safer and more promising investment bet.

However, this momentum may be difficult to sustain. In the fiscal second quarter, Disney expects its Sports segment operating income to be adversely impacted by approximately $100 million due to college sports costs, including the shift of three College Football Playoff games from the previous quarter into the fiscal second quarter and one additional NFL game. Disney also guided that the fiscal second-quarter will be unfavorably impacted by a write-off of more than $50 million as a result of exiting the Venu joint venture.Our model estimates for Entertainment revenues (which include Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing and Other Revenues) are pegged at $10.31 billion, indicating an increase of 5.2% year over year.The Experiences segment, which includes Disney's theme parks and cruise line business, also faces challenges. For the fiscal second quarter, Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses of more than $40 million are expected to have weighed on results. For the full fiscal year, total pre-opening expenses related to Disney Cruise Line expansion are projected to reach more than $200 million. These expenses represent significant near-term costs without immediate revenue offsets.Our model estimate for the Experiences segment (renamed from Disney Parks, Experiences and Products) revenues is $8.93 billion, indicating 6.4% growth year over year.While Disney's streaming services appear to be gaining traction with the ESPN tile on Disney+ showing encouraging early indications and fiscal first-quarter Entertainment Direct-To-Consumer results reflecting improved profitability with nearly $300 million in operating income, continued subscriber growth remains uncertain. For the upcoming results, management expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers compared to the fiscal first quarter, suggesting ongoing challenges in maintaining subscriber momentum.The company's recent ventures into original programming for Disney+, such as the new daily sports show SC+ and the 24/7 Simpsons stream, represent strategic investments that may not yield immediate returns. Meanwhile, the recent transaction to combine Hulu+ Live TV assets with fuboTV creates additional integration complexity and execution risk.Disney's acquisition of a 70% stake in Fubo will require regulatory approvals and Fubo shareholder approval, introducing uncertainty around timing and potential regulatory hurdles. This transaction, while potentially beneficial long-term, represents one of several moving pieces in Disney's complex business transformation.From a financial perspective, Disney delivered strong consolidated first-quarter fiscal 2025 results with 44% growth in diluted earnings per share excluding certain items, 5% growth in revenues, and 31% growth in total segment operating income. However, these results might have set expectations too high for the fiscal second quarter, given the aforementioned headwinds.Looking forward, management continues to expect high-single digit adjusted EPS growth for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, but achieving this target depends on successful execution across multiple fronts. Given the anticipated challenges and valuation concerns in the fiscal second quarter, investors should consider taking profits ahead of earnings and potentially re-establishing positions at more favorable entry points after gaining greater clarity on Disney's trajectory for the remainder of fiscal 2025.Price Performance & Stock ValuationShares of DIS have lost 16.9% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and peers. Disney operates in a fiercely competitive streaming market dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Netflix NFLX, as well as the growing prominence of services from Apple, Comcast CMCSA-owned Peacock and HBO Max.Year-to-Date PerformanceValuation-wise, Disney is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 1.72X compared with the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry’s 1.39X, reflecting a stretched valuation. The company’s debt balance of $45.3 billion compares unfavorably with cash, cash equivalents and its current marketable investment securities balance of $6 billion.DIS’s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched ValuationInvestment Considerations Ahead of Q2 ResultsDisney's premium valuation appears increasingly difficult to justify ahead of the fiscal second-quarter results. While the company delivered strong performance in the previous quarter, several headwinds loom on the horizon. The Sports segment faces a $100 million impact from college sports costs and an additional $50 million write-off from exiting the Venu joint venture. Disney Cruise Line pre-opening expenses will add another $40 million burden. Management expects a modest decline in Disney+ subscribers, undermining streaming momentum. The Fubo acquisition introduces regulatory uncertainty, while competition intensifies across all business segments. Despite strategic investments in original programming and platform enhancements, DIS' current valuation doesn't adequately reflect these near-term challenges. Investors should consider reducing exposure before fiscal second-quarter earnings reveal the full impact of these operational headwinds.Final ThoughtDisney's near-term outlook appears challenging despite robust fiscal first-quarter results. With anticipated Sports segment headwinds of $150 million, Cruise Line pre-opening expenses, and projected Disney+ subscriber declines, the company faces multiple operational pressures. These factors, combined with Fubo acquisition uncertainties and intensifying competition across all segments, suggest the premium valuation is increasingly difficult to justify. Investors should consider reducing positions before the fiscal second-quarter results potentially reveal the full extent of these challenges.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d3674b0e2094b:0-disney-s-q2-earnings-coming-up-time-to-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock/

Seaport Research's David Joyce lifted his target to $1,230, praising Netflix's in-house ad capabilities and flexibility across formats even as subscription price hikes and membership growth continue to underpin the majority of revenue. The FT-reported upgrades reflect growing confidence that Netflix can parlay ad traction into material revenue, offsetting subscriber-growth plateaus in mature markets.

Netflix Stock Gets a Price-Target Hike. Why It Still Has Upside After a Great Run. — Barrons.com,1747394880000,"By George GloverNetflix is on a stellar run — but the video streamer's shares could still have upside thanks to their tariff resilience and new series of Stranger Things and Bridgerton.That's the view of Seaport Research Partners analyst David Joyce, who rates the red-hot tech stock at a Buy. He raised his price target to $1,230 from $1,060 Thursday — that implies shares could rise about 4.4% from their current level.Those aren't eye-popping gains, but Joyce said he sees Netflix as more of ""a core holding with limited downside"" and ""a good buy-on-the-dip candidate."" He expects the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to jump 14% to $15.24 billion between the start of this year and the end of 2026, citing a slate of new content, the success of the streamer's ad-supported tiers, and subscription price hikes.Joyce added that the stock's ""recession-resilience during the spring market turbulence"" should also boost their appeal. The stock is up about 25% since April 2, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans sparked a broad and brutal market selloff. Investors see it as a safe haven because Netflix imports content, rather than goods. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 5% over the same period.This week, Barron's argued that Netflix stock remains a Buy despite its lofty valuation, with its margin likely to grow at a fast enough rate to maintain momentum.The streamer's own executives are also targeting further gains. They're aiming to double revenue and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization by the end of 2030, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter. As of Thursday's close, Netflix had a market capitalization of just over $500 billion.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Following its earnings announcement, the streaming giant saw its shares jump more than 4% in after-hours trading.This was followed by a rise of 3% in premarket trading on Monday as the streaming giant's upbeat annual revenue outlook reassured investors that it could withstand any economic downturn amid a tariff-laden economic climate.The company reported first-quarter 2025 earnings of $6.61 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.17%. The figure jumped 54.8% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $10.54 billion increased 12.5% year over year or 16% on a foreign exchange (F/X) neutral basis, driven primarily by membership growth and higher pricing, partially offset by F/X, net of hedging. Revenues were modestly above guidance due to slightly higher-than-forecasted subscription and ad revenues (which is still very small relative to subscription revenues). The figure missed the consensus mark marginally by 0.04%.The United States and Canada (UCAN) revenues grew 9% year over year compared with 15% in fourth-quarter 2024 due to only a partial quarter impact from the price change, plan mix and the absence of advertising revenues from the Christmas Day NFL games. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news .In a notable shift, Netflix has moved away from reporting specific subscriber counts starting with the first quarter of 2025, preferring instead to focus on financial metrics and user engagement. While tech giants like Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN do not reveal subscriber figures for their respective streaming services, other media companies do. Disney ( DIS) separately breaks out Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ figures.Starting with the second quarter of 2025 results, Netflix will publish its bi-annual engagement report, which accounts for 99% of all viewing on Netflix, in tandem with second and fourth-quarter earnings results. Netflix, Inc.

Netflix has $13.6 billion remaining under existing share repurchase authorization.In the second quarter, Netflix has $1 billion of debt maturities, which the company will pay down with proceeds from its investment grade bond deal last year, which are currently held in short-term investments. GuidanceLooking ahead, Netflix provided guidance that further excited investors. For the second quarter of 2025, NFLX forecasts revenues to increase 15.4% (+17% F/X neutral) to $11.035 billion, as the company foresees the full quarter benefit from recent price changes and continued growth in membership and advertising revenues. The company expects UCAN revenue growth to reaccelerate in the second quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $10.96 billion.NFLX has projected earnings of $7.03 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.22 per share.Netflix projects an operating margin of 33%, a ~6 percentage point year-over-year improvement.

Netflix has also slated the series finales of the Emmy Award-winning adult animated series Big Mouth , and fan-favorite YOU . The company recently launched its Ad Suite in the United States on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenue growth to double in 2025, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment.Netflix continues to forecast 2025 revenues of $43.5-$44.5 billion, which assumes healthy member growth, higher subscription pricing and a rough doubling of ad revenues, partially offset by F/X net of hedging. Netflix is still forecasting full-year 2025 free cash flow of about $8 billion.The company is still targeting a 29% operating margin for 2025 based on F/X rates as of January 1, 2025. There has been no material change to the company’s overall business outlook since the last earnings report, although at current F/X rates (with the recent weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to most other currencies), Netflix is currently tracking above the mid-point of the 2025 revenue guidance range. In a bold move that captured investors’ attention, the company set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization. Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division, and building its advertising business. These strategic initiatives are expected to drive significant revenue and profit growth in the coming years.The ad-supported subscription tier has become a significant success story for Netflix. According to company data, more than 55% of new subscribers in markets where it’s available are choosing the ad-supported option. This has led management to project advertising revenues reaching $9 billion annually by 2030, representing an increasing portion of Netflix’s total revenues.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ab1d42ab6094b:0-netflix-q1-earnings-beat-revenues-rise-y-y-on-subscriber-gain/

Trump orders 100% tariff on foreign-made movies to save 'dying' Hollywood,1746407454000,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers.""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,"" Trump said on Truth Social.Trump said he was authorizing the relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.He added: ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X: ""We're on it."" Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on how the tariffs would be implemented. It was unclear if the tariffs would apply to movies on streaming services as well as those shown in theaters, or if they would be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue. Hollywood executives were trying to sort out details on Sunday night. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the major studios, had no immediate comment. In January, Trump appointed Hollywood veterans Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson to bring Hollywood back ""bigger, better and stronger than ever before.""Movie and TV production has been exiting Hollywood for years, heading to locations with tax incentives that make filming cheaper. Governments around the world have increased credits and cash rebates to attract productions and capture a greater share of the $248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.All major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain. Shares in Disney, Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD , Paramount Global NASDAQ:PARA and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN were lower in early trade on Monday.On Monday, leaders in Australia and New Zealand responded to Trump's tariff announcement by saying they would advocate for their local industries. Some Marvel superhero movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was the backdrop for ""The Lord of the Rings"" films.The British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the government to move swiftly to protect the country's ""vital"" film industry. ""These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,"" said Bectu head Philippa Childs. She said they would also threaten tens of thousands of jobs of freelancers who make films in the UK. Film and high-end TV production in the UK was worth 5.6 billion pounds ($7.45 billion) in 2024, a 31% increase over 2023, according to the British Film Institute. The government's Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 'LOT MORE TO LOSE THAN TO GAIN'In 2023, about half of the spending by U.S. producers on movie and TV projects with budgets of more than $40 million went outside the U.S., according to research firm ProdPro. ""I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),"" said Scott Roxborough, Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter. Film and television production has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade in Hollywood's home city of Los Angeles, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region's production.The January wildfires accelerated concerns that producers may look outside Los Angeles, and that camera operators, costume designers, sound technicians and other behind-the-scenes workers may move out of town rather than try to rebuild in their neighborhoods. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most preferred place to film in the next two years, behind Toronto, Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia. Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state's tax incentives to better compete with other locations. Trump's proposed movie tariff follows a series of trade conflicts initiated by his administration, which have roiled markets and led to fears of a U.S. recession.Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump's film tariffs would be devastating.""The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,"" he said, adding it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.

Top Streaming Content Stocks to Keep an Eye on for Solid Gains,1746206220000,"An updated edition of the March 12, 2025 article.The entertainment industry has dramatically evolved over the past 20 years, shifting from conventional cable TV to the era of on-demand digital streaming. While early streaming trials appeared in the 1990s, real momentum came with YouTube’s launch in 2005 and Netflix’s rollout of its video-on-demand service in 2007. The combination of faster broadband, widespread smartphone adoption and changing consumer habits has made streaming the leading mode of media consumption. Industry giants like Alphabet GOOGL, Netflix NFLX and Roku ROKU have capitalized on this trend.Streaming allows users to play audio and video online instantly, without downloading entire files, offering smooth playback and minimal buffering. This ease of access — across smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs — has revolutionized how people engage with media. Viewers are drawn to the flexibility of watching content anytime, anywhere, often with fewer ads than traditional broadcasts. To stay competitive, streaming platforms are pouring resources into exclusive and original content, fueling fierce competition known as the “content wars.”Several trends continue to propel the sector’s growth: increasing global internet access, a surge in mobile viewing and AI-driven recommendation systems that personalize the user experience. The rise of connected devices, from gaming consoles to smart TVs, has also widened the market for streaming services. By 2029, the global video streaming market is expected to generate $190 billion annually from 2 billion paid subscriptions, according to research by Ampere Analysis. While Subscription Video-on-Demand (SVOD) dominates, Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV (FAST) and hybrid offerings are gaining steam. Sports streaming and interactive features like live events and gaming are also driving deeper engagement.For investors, streaming stocks present a compelling opportunity, with leading companies boosting revenues through pricing adjustments, global market expansion and the growth of ad-supported models. Efforts in content localization and strategic alliances are also extending international reach, reinforcing streaming’s status as a dynamic and profitable investment space.So, if you want to join the bandwagon, our Streaming Content Thematic Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time.

Its growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division and building its advertising business. These strategic initiatives are expected to drive significant revenue and profit growth in the coming years. Moreover, the ad-supported subscription tier is becoming a significant success story for Netflix.Alphabet’s YouTube is the world’s largest video-sharing platform. Since launching its subscription-based YouTube TV service in 2017, it has become a major player in the cord-cutting market. Leveraging a dual-revenue model — advertising and premium subscriptions — YouTube stands out as one of the most financially resilient streaming services.The platform continues to expand its investment in creator-driven content, short-form videos through YouTube Shorts and exclusive sports streaming rights. Its leadership in user-generated content, combined with AI-enhanced content discovery, delivers a formidable competitive edge. Moreover, the growing influence of creator-led marketing and monetization opportunities via the YouTube Partner Program strengthens its revenue streams.Alphabet’s ongoing investments in AI are fueling consistent growth and increased watch time across both YouTube’s ad-supported and premium offerings.

It began as a streaming device company in 2008 but has since transformed into a comprehensive streaming platform.The company is experiencing strong growth in streaming households, driven by sales of stand-alone streaming devices, collaborations with TV brands such as TCL, JVC, Sharp and other major TV makers who license the Roku OS to manufacture and sell Roku TV models, and licensing of the Roku OS to certain service operators.Additionally, Roku is capitalizing on advertising growth fueled by rising monetized video ad impressions spurred by the growing popularity of The Roku Channel. This momentum is supported by sustained interest from traditional TV advertisers shifting to streaming, along with continued investment in its OneView ad platform and broader ad tech infrastructure. ROKU carries a Zacks Rank #3.Roku bridges content publishers and users at scale, offering a robust suite of promotional tools to boost engagement and reach.

Netflix gains as rosy forecast calms investor nerves amid tariff fears,1745244011000,"Netflix shares rose about 3% on Monday after the streaming company reaffirmed its annual revenue forecast, assuring investors that it could withstand any economic downturn amid a tariff-laden economic climate.The company's co-CEO Greg Peters noted that the entertainment sector, and Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX specifically, had proven resilient during previous downturns.Peters said on Thursday they had not seen any significant shifts in customer behavior, adding the company ""still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up.""The remarks offered some respite to investors who were worried that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies could likely lead to a recession, forcing consumers to rein in spending on streaming services.""Even in a global recession scenario, Netflix is likely to be highly resilient given the price-to-value of the service remains very attractive,"" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, who is five-star rated for both estimate accuracy and recommendation performance, as per LSEG data.""Their advertising business should demonstrate strong growth in any scenario given its nascent state,"" Wlodarczak added.Netflix reaffirmed its 2025 revenue forecast of between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and reported first-quarter earnings above analysts' expectations.The lower-priced, ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available, Netflix said.""2025 is an important year for advertising monetization as Netflix moves from largely leveraging third parties to rolling out its own first-party advertising suite of products,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.Even if the macro economy softens, the brokerage said it remains confident in Netflix's ability to grow average revenue per member and scale up its advertising business.At least 19 brokerages raised their price targets on Netflix's shares following the results, bringing the median target to $1,147.50.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QZ0QV:0-netflix-gains-as-rosy-forecast-calms-investor-nerves-amid-tariff-fears/"
Warner Bros Discovery revives HBO Max branding for global push,1747236010000,"Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD is hitting rewind on Max's branding, bringing back the HBO name it dropped from the streaming service two years ago.The company will rebrand its streaming platform as HBO Max this summer, betting that the iconic brand's global reputation will drive subscriber growth as it expands internationally.The return to HBO Max also marks an ""implicit promise"" by the company to deliver unique and premium content, WBD said on Wednesday. HBO is home to some of the most popular, critically-acclaimed series including ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Detective."" ""Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead,"" CEO David Zaslav said.WBD's decision to drop HBO from HBO Max in 2023 followed its move to merge HBO dramas and top franchises like ""Harry Potter"" with lifestyle-focused content from Discovery under one service.The goal was to offer a more appealing product and to help retain viewers who typically canceled their subscriptions after watching the latest season of their favorite show.But it saw strong backlash from audiences. Even Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , called the move a surprise. ""I would have never guessed HBO would have gone away. They put all that effort into one thing that they can tell the consumer - it should be HBO,"" he said in a Variety interview in March. Streaming has become a major growth area for WBD as its cable TV business suffers from cord-cutting. Shows including ""The White Lotus"" and ""The Pitt"" helped it amass 5.3 million streaming subscribers in the January-March quarter, taking its total to 122.3 million. The company expects its subscriber base to exceed 150 million by the end of 2026. A key driver of that growth has been international expansion. After rolling out Max in over 70 countries last year, WBD plans to launch the service in the UK, Ireland, Italy and Germany.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RM1EJ:0-warner-bros-discovery-revives-hbo-max-branding-for-global-push/"
These companies are emerging as potential winners in Trump's trade war,1746205320000,"By James RogersThis earnings season, companies in some sectors have started spelling out the potential financial impact of tariffs, while others have withdrawn their outlooks citing too much uncertaintyThe fallout from President Trump's sweeping tariffs agenda is casting a long shadow over earnings season as companies wrestle with the unfolding trade war, but there are also glimmers of opportunity amid the uncertainty, according to LPL Financial.Despite the market turmoil, names in some sectors are spelling out the financial impact of tariffs, while others have pulled their guidance, saying that the economic outlook is too uncertain. A handful of names have even cited potential benefits from the tariffs climate.Set against this backdrop, Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted opportunities in a note released this week. He categorizes this current period as ""phase one,"" characterized as ""peak uncertainty and peak tariffs,"" with ""phase two"" the period ""after the tariff dust settles.""""We believe consumer staples, real estate, and gold are well positioned for the current phase of uncertainty,"" wrote Buchbinder.He acknowledged, however, that not all consumer staples companies will be immune.Domestic packaged food companies are relatively insulated thanks to specialty crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados and chocolate falling within the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, he said. ""On the other hand, dollar stores and supercenters are not immune due to a reliance on goods from China and will be forced to raise prices or adjust supply chains after inventories are depleted,"" Buchbinder added.Related: GE Healthcare sees tariffs costing $500 million in 2025, then much less next yearBuchbinder said empty shelves are a real risk, and that imports of alcoholic beverages and spirits could be a point of pain. He also mentions the impact of cumulative price increases, ongoing sticky inflation and elevated consumer borrowing.""That said, given staples are more 'needs' than 'wants' and revenues typically hold up well in an economic slowdown, we'll put consumer staples in the phase-one winner category,"" he added.However, Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the parent of household brands including Pampers, Gillette, Crest and Tide, cut its earnings outlook last week amid worries about higher prices from tariffs and a slowing economy. Toothpaste and soap maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) also cut its guidance last week.Parts of the healthcare sector also stand to benefit from the current tariffs climate, according to LPL Financial.""It would be logical to put the defensive healthcare sector among the phase one winners, but pharmaceuticals are in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's trade policy,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""Sectoral tariffs could rattle the sector, pending successful country-level negotiations.""However, the analyst sees opportunity around medical devices. ""On the medical equipment side, tariff exposure is relatively limited, with the most exposed companies generating 12% or less of their revenue in China and most manufacturing housed in the U.S., so that group may be a phase one winner,"" he wrote.The healthcare sector has been breaking down the financial cost of tariffs in recent weeks.Medical technology company GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (GEHC) said earlier this week that the impact of the global tariffs war will cost it around $500 million at current rates and cut its full-year profit outlook. And medical-device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT) estimated recently that tariffs will cost it ""a few hundred million dollars"" this year, but reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Related: Procter & Gamble sees consumers hit 'pause' amid tariffs, job-market uncertaintyLast week, drugmaker Merck & Co. (MRK) said that its reaffirmed 2025 outlook absorbs an estimated $200 million in additional costs for already implemented tariffs. Medical-technology and drug company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) estimated that tariffs could result in about $400 million in extra costs and raised its sales outlook.Financials are also a phase-one winner because of the sector's limited exposure to goods imports, according to LPL Financial, although cyclicality also makes them a potential winner in phase two.For phase two, LPL Financial sees the communication services sector as a potential winner, with ""honorable mentions"" for technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials.In communication services, LPL Financial points to solid first-quarter results from Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX).""The key risk, beyond regulatory pressures on the big internet companies, is that tariff rates don't come down as much as we anticipate, weighing on margins in this space, although the effects on the digital media segment of the sector are quite manageable,"" Buchbinder wrote.He believes the tech sector could easily grow earnings 20% this year as AI investment continues but says that technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. ""The sector has underperformed since July of 2024,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""We also worry about semiconductor industry disruptions from U.S.-China trade tensions,"" he added, noting that this has challenged Nvidia Corp.'s performance lately.Software appears better positioned for this environment than semiconductors, according to LPL Financial. The financial services company also notes that tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) has significant operations in China that will not be cheap or quick to move away from.Related: Here's how GM is dealing with tariff uncertainty: pulling guidance, halting stock buybackMeanwhile, consumer discretionary, which sell what people ""want,"" is heavily impacted by the tariffs regime.""Tariffs on apparel makers, autos, and home construction materials (primarily lumber) are particularly biting, while policy uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence and contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending,"" wrote Buchbinder.On Thursday car giant General Motors Co. (GM) slashed its profit guidance and said that it expects tariffs to cost up to $5 billion.Elsewhere in consumer discretionary, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) kept its full-year profit outlook intact and described tariffs as ""manageable,"" while rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) cut its full-year outlook.Household products maker Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) said that tariffs could actually benefit its business and maintained much of its 2025 outlook. Consumer-facing washer and dryer maker Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) also said that it could be a ""winner"" under the new tariffs regime and kept its full-year guidance unchanged.However, airlines are a different story, with American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) pulling their guidance amid macroeconomic uncertainty.LPL Financial acknowledges that, while consumer discretionary is one of the sectors hardest hit by tariffs, it makes sense that it would benefit if levies come down.""But the uncertainty is still too high right now and a neutral stance seems prudent,"" Buchbinder wrote.-James RogersThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

9 Stocks That Are Close to New Highs Despite Market Turmoil — Barrons.com,1746120480000,"By Teresa RivasAs stocks swooned in response to the so-called Liberation Day tariff news, it seemed April would be the cruelest month, to borrow a phrase from T.S. Eliot. Yet by month's end, it was far from a wasteland.As stocks closed on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was down less than 1% compared with before President Donald Trump unveiled a 10% tariff on nearly all countries, plus higher ""reciprocal"" levies on many more. The Nasdaq Composite had eked out a gain.Nonetheless, some scars remain. On Thursday, the first trading day of May, none of the stocks in the S&P 100 opened at record levels, despite stocks making broad-based gains. Philip Morris and Netflix closed at new highs on Wednesday, but slipped back as trading began on Thursday.Nine S&P 100 stocks — Philip Morris, Netflix, Berkshire Hathaway, Duke Energy, McDonald's, Southern Company, Coca-Cola, Palantir Technologies, and Booking Holdings — were within 5% of record levels. That eclectic group reflects the market's mood last month.As a defensive name, Philip Morris shone throughout April as investors fled to safety, while also delivering upbeat quarterly results near the end of the month. The company's chief financial officer spoke with Barron's following the report, noting that Philip Morris continues to benefit from the shift away from traditional cigarettes.The story was largely the same for Coca-Cola. The consumer-staple stalwart had been doing well even before reporting a strong first quarter and noting that tariffs would be ""manageable.""Many investors felt they could do worse during times of turmoil than following in the footsteps of Warren Buffett, although Berkshire Hathaway was nearly flat in April, as was utility Duke Energy. Berkshire will report its results on Saturday, while Duke is scheduled to do so on Tuesday. Fellow utility Southern wasn't doing much on Thursday, despite reporting a better-than-expected quarter.A strong quarter was just icing on the cake for Netflix, which soared throughout April. Streaming video, the company's main business, is a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment, and Spotify is fairly well integrated into the countries where it operates. The result is that many investors believe it is insulated from the trade war and any economic slowdown it brings.McDonald's reported a disappointing first quarter on Thursday. Restaurants have been a tough space in general as nervous consumers pull back on dining out. Still, given its size and inexpensive meals, McDonald's has a somewhat defensive reputation, and was still up throughout April.In tech, Palantir wasn't only an April winner, but one of the best performers through the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency. Investors continue to buy the stock because of the potential growth of its artificial intelligence-powered software business.Booking, the online travel agency formerly known as Priceline, was up roughly 10% last month. Although investors are worried about travel demand in light of uncertainty swirling around policy, trade, and the broader economy, the company's first quarter was strong and management said demand was stable. Booking is one of the larger and more established players in the industry, so it is often seen as one of the safer bets during downturns.In short, although early April's carnage has healed to a degree because Trump has walked back some tariffs and investors are hopeful the economy will avoid the worst potential outcomes, not many stocks gained last month. Shares with decent defensive characteristics or company-specific reasons for potential gains were the exception.Here's hoping for a calmer May.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

3 Reasons Why Disney Stock May Be a Smart Buy After Q2 Earnings Beat,1747139040000,"Disney DIS delivered impressive second-quarter fiscal 2025 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues, demonstrating strong momentum across its business segments. (Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)With shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.Impressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic ExecutionDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.These results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.The Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.Direct-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share. These projections suggest steady growth ahead.(Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Streaming Profitability Achieved as Content Drives GrowthAfter years of heavy investment in its streaming platforms, Disney has successfully navigated the challenging transition from traditional media to direct-to-consumer models. The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.Disney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.The company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash . These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.Disney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.Shares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+. While Netflix has returned 24.5% year to date, shares of Amazon and Apple have lost 4.9% and 15.85%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceMultiple Growth Catalysts on the HorizonLooking ahead, Disney has several compelling growth catalysts that should drive shareholder value in the coming years.In sports, ESPN delivered its most-watched second quarter in primetime ever, with viewership among the key 18-49 demographic up 32% compared to the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by marquee events like the USA/Canada 4 Nations Championship and Women's College Basketball, which saw its most-watched regular season in 16 years.The company is preparing to launch ESPN's exciting new direct-to-consumer product offering, which should further strengthen its position as the preeminent digital sports platform.Meanwhile, the Experiences segment delivered strong results, with Domestic Parks & Experiences operating income growing 13% compared to the prior-year quarter. At Disney Cruise Line, the Disney Treasure is now in its second full quarter of operations, with two more cruise ships joining the fleet later this year.Most impressive is Disney's unprecedented pipeline of expansion projects around the world, creating thousands of new jobs in Florida and California. This includes special celebrations for Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary and Disneyland's historic 70th anniversary.The Bottom Line: Disney Offers Compelling Value at a DiscountBased on its strong second-quarter results and improved outlook, Disney stock appears significantly undervalued relative to its growth prospects. The company currently trades at just 19.25 times trailing 12-month price-to-earnings, notably below the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry average of 21.37 times. This valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a premium media brand.DIS’ 3-Year P/E TTM Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationManagement has confidently raised guidance for fiscal 2025, now expecting adjusted EPS of approximately $5.75, representing a 16% increase over fiscal 2024. The company also projects approximately $17 billion in cash provided by operations, suggesting a $2 billion increase over prior guidance. This robust cash flow enables continued investments in growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders through the company's share repurchase program.ConclusionWith its streaming services now profitable, box office hits driving multi-channel revenues, significant expansion projects underway in the Parks segment, and a valuation below industry averages, Disney offers investors exposure to multiple growth vectors with increasingly solid financial fundamentals. For investors looking for a blue-chip media and entertainment company with both defensive characteristics and growth potential, DIS stock appears to be a compelling buy at current levels. Disney currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Formula One's Long — and Successful — Race to Crack America — Journal Report,1746108000000,"By Joshua Robinson and Jonathan CleggNot so long ago — before Formula One was organizing races down the Las Vegas Strip, or in the Miami sunshine, or for half a million fans in Austin, Texas — the U.S. was the one place on earth that felt agonizingly out of reach for the world's most prestigious racing series.It wasn't for lack of trying. Ever since F1 began in 1950, organizers had brought Grand Prix races to the U.S., desperately hoping to seduce the American market that understood and embraced its traditionally oval-track motor sports, Nascar and IndyCar. But everywhere they went, the F1 traveling circus ran into a mix of misfortune, incompetence and, worst of all, indifference.In Vegas in the 1980s, F1 was relegated to racing in the parking lot of Caesars Palace. In Indianapolis, a tire fiasco led to a race featuring only six cars, instead of the planned 20. And in Phoenix, Formula One was once outdrawn by an ostrich festival held on the same weekend. To American fans, this English-driven sport might as well have been speaking a different language.""In the old times, F1 was too presumptuous,"" F1 Chief Executive Stefano Domenicali says. ""Formula One was coming to the U.S. [as if] there was nothing to explain.""Now, with F1 in its 75th season, the picture couldn't be more different. With a devoted stateside following and a genuine cultural toehold, the sport has gone far beyond simply cracking a U.S. market that former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone had all but given up on. In 2025, Formula One has put America squarely at the center of its business.A new realityThis surprising turn toward the U.S. began when the series was acquired by the Colorado-based Liberty Media in 2017 for more than $4 billion. At the time, there was only one Grand Prix a year in America, in Austin, and ratings were almost negligible.It took the sudden success of Netflix's F1 reality show, ""Drive to Survive,"" during the early part of the pandemic in 2019 to jump-start interest from U.S. audiences. In 2022, F1 added a second American Grand Prix in Miami, and the following year it launched the Vegas Strip race.Each one comes with a distinct vibe. If Austin is the closest thing to a race in the European heartland, with its petrolhead music-festival ambience, Miami was designed to be Monaco on Biscayne Bay. Vegas, meanwhile, was imagined as the over-the-top, one-of-a-kind spectacle created specifically for the ""Drive to Survive"" generation. Last season, those three Grand Prix weekends drew more than a million fans combined, on par with the most popular European races.But the sport's brass isn't letting up on its American push. Its latest crossover project, a blockbuster movie called ""F1"" starring Brad Pitt and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, will hit theaters this summer. And next year the sport will expand to admit Cadillac, backed by General Motors, as the 11th F1 team.The reason for such a concerted push on this side of the Atlantic is that in the U.S., F1 has tapped into the kind of audience that advertisers salivate over. They're young, affluent and more gender-balanced than your average sports crowd, with an average age of 35 and roughly 60% men and 40% women, F1 says.Never mind that they might not have been watching during the heyday of such F1 luminaries as Michael Schumacher in the early 2000s, or even during Lewis Hamilton's prime in the 2010s. The new fans who surfed in on the ""Drive to Survive"" wave adopted the current cast of drivers as their own and helped F1 gain unprecedented cultural relevance in the U.S.""We are feeling that explosion in the sport, of the popularity of the sport, and it's with a different generation,"" says Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll. ""They're able to follow it on their phone. They don't have to sit home at 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon or watch it on TV.""That's not necessarily ideal for a sport that hasn't entirely moved past the traditional moneymaking model of raking in cash through the sale of television rights. All of that stateside popularity has yet to turn into the American broadcast deal of F1's dreams.ESPN, which was paying exactly $0 for the rights to the series as recently as 2018, chose to walk away from its exclusive negotiation window for a new package late last year. F1, which is reportedly seeking between $150 million and $180 million a season, declined to comment on negotiations with prospective broadcast partners, but said it was confident it would secure a contract soon.Driver wantedOne thing that could change the calculus would be the arrival of an American driver.F1 hasn't had an American world champion since Mario Andretti in 1978, and no one has come close. In fact, no American has won so much as a single Grand Prix since that season. The most recent driver to give it a try was the Florida-born Logan Sargeant, whose stay in F1 lasted less than two seasons. His best race finish was 10th place.Everyone in the sport knows how much of an impact a competitive U.S. driver could have. When Schumacher dominated the series, he single-handedly revived F1 interest in his native Germany. Fernando Alonso did the same for Spain late in the first decade of the 2000s. And now that Max Verstappen is a four-time world champion, hordes of Dutch fans in orange gear are a fixture at circuits around the world.The hope in F1 circles now is that Cadillac can be the team to foster the next promising U.S. racer. But Formula One isn't waiting around for that lightning to strike. Rumors have been circulating for over a year that the sport is on the hunt for yet another American track.Email Joshua Robinson, a Wall Street Journal editor in New York, at joshua.robinson@wsj.com.

Still Time to Buy Spotify (SPOT) Stock After Q1 Earnings?,1746058980000,"Despite missing its first quarter expectations on Tuesday, Spotify SPOT stock has risen +3% since its Q1 report to over $600 a share.That said, investors may be wondering if the rally in the music streaming giant’s stock can continue with SPOT up more than +35% year to date, to largely outperform the declines among the broader indexes and even top Netflix’s NFLX +27%. Spotify’s Q1 Results Missing analysts' lofty forecast, Spotify reported Q1 EPS of $1.13 compared to expectations of $2.29 per share. Still, this was a 7% increase from earnings of $1.05 a share in Q1 2024. Spotify’s Q1 sales rose 11% year over year to $4.4 billion, although this missed estimates of $4.59 billion.Like video streaming king Netflix, Spotify’s subscription growth among its music platform has led to much hype in recent years, with it noteworthy that the company’s net subscribers spiked 12% during Q1 to 268 million.

Based on Zacks projections, Spotify’s total sales are expected to increase 16% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to spike another 15% in FY26 to $22.55 billion. Notably, the Sweden-based technology firm expects Q2 operating income at 539 million euros and forecasts a 31.5% gross margin.Regarding full-year margins, Spotify continues to expect improvement in 2025 at what it called a more measured pace than last year's exceptional gains as the company strategically invests to accelerate its long-term growth ambitions. SPOT EPS RevisionsSuggesting more upside in Spotify stock is that earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher over the last week. Plus, FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are now up 5% and 8% in the last 60 days, respectively.Spotify’s annual earnings are currently expected to soar 78% this year to $10.61 per share, from EPS of $5.95 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to spike another 31% to $13.95.  Bottom Line Spotify’s rapid expansion is still hard to overlook, with its stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This is largely predicated on the trend of positive earnings estimate revisions even amid its Q1 earnings miss. Correlating with such, it wouldn’t be surprising if the stellar price performance of SPOT continued.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:294f00d5c094b:0-still-time-to-buy-spotify-spot-stock-after-q1-earnings/

Top Founder-Run Company Stocks That Can Drive Solid Returns ,1746035460000,"An updated edition of the March 10, 2025, article.No one is better positioned to understand, nurture and build a company than its founder. Much like a mother devoted to raising her child, founders invest in their ventures with profound passion, unwavering vision and relentless dedication. Their appetite for risk often exceeds that of professional managers, as they willingly embrace new approaches, foster innovation and make bold choices to achieve success. As a result, these companies frequently become genuine manifestations of their founders’ core values and aspirations.However, founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Tesla, Inc . TSLA, Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (BRK.B) and Netflix NFLX. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead.As these companies are born out of a unique idea, they often involve technological innovation. These companies are built from scratch in a way that they can navigate challenges to stay sustainable over the longer term. Initially, others may not relate to a founder’s belief, making it difficult to source funds for the project. The founder often ends up putting personal wealth and savings into such bootstrap companies. If successful, they attract angel investors or raise funds. But it's always the founder-owner whose stake and risk are the highest. Moreover, a founder-owner often finds it difficult to delegate responsibilities as they are skeptical if others could do justice to the role. Thus, they often hold multiple senior/leadership positions and also face difficulties in finding a torchbearer. But one cannot be jack of all trades. Owing to their reluctance to delegate duties, these founders/owners tend to lose out on the benefits of professional expertise.Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like Netflix, Intercontinental Exchange ICE and Affirm Holdings AFRM look appealing. Ready to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

The company evolved from a small DVD rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider, courtesy of its wide-ranging content portfolio and strong international footprint. Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. co-founded Netflix with Marc Randolph in 1997 and is the executive chairman of the company.Netflix has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping the company sustain its leading position despite the launch of services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video. NFLX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The company’s focus on streaming regional content has been leading to international growth. Netflix is diversifying its content portfolio and working on projects across India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East. The company has launched low-priced mobile plans in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Moreover, the upcoming lower-priced ad tier is expected to further drive growth in these price-sensitive regions. Netflix’s 2025 priorities include improving its core business with more series and films to offer an enhanced product experience, growth of its ads business, and newer initiatives such as live programming and games. It believes these initiatives should help it sustain healthy growth and thus projects 2025 revenues between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion and an operating margin of 29%.Intercontinental Exchange, with a market capitalization of $95.6 billion, has evolved from a small start-up less than three decades ago to a company whose networks help customers manage risk, harness data and improve workflow efficiency. Jeffrey C. Sprecher, founder, chairman & CEO of ICE, stated, “These efforts saw ICE report its 19th consecutive year of record net revenues and record adjusted earnings per share, something we have achieved every year since we’ve been a public company.” Its competitive advantage lies in the digitization of fixed income workflows and automating mortgage manufacturing.With over 5,000 indices representing more than $1 trillion in benchmark assets under management, the company boasts being the second-largest fixed income provider globally. This Zacks Rank #2 company has grown over the past two decades, primarily through buyouts and collaborations that have not only fueled its growth but have also led to achieving expense synergies. Intercontinental Exchange remains well-positioned for growth on the back of accelerated digitization taking place in the U.S. residential mortgage industry to overcome several inefficiencies across the mortgage origination workflow. While the company already boasts the largest mortgage network across the United States, the integration of Ellie Mae into ICE Mortgage Technology is likely to help the company in boosting its mortgage business.A healthy and minimal risk-based balance sheet is likely to continue, providing stability and buoyancy over the medium to long term while supporting strategic investments.Affirm, with a market capitalization of $16.3 billion, a financial technology company, has emerged as a major player in the BNPL space, one of the fastest-growing segments in fintech. Affirm collaborates with merchants to integrate its pay-over-time solutions at the point of sale, boasting over 337,000 active merchant partners as of Dec. 31, 2024, across diverse sectors. Max Levchin, founder and CEO, believes “Affirm is in the strongest shape it’s ever been.”Affirm benefits from organic growth, expanding merchant partnerships, advancing technology and product innovation and expansionary measures. Technology is the backbone of a payments company like Affirm, as it powers the company’s cloud-based, data-driven platform. Affirm uses advanced machine learning and predictive models to assess fraud risk and creditworthiness and personalize services, enabling better risk assessment and pricing. Its proprietary technology, with access to data from 215 million loans, improves efficiency and scalability, creating a moat. Affirm is steadily evolving into a broader financial services platform. This diversification strategy not only expands Affirm’s addressable market but also creates new revenue streams. The company achieved GAAP profitability in the last reported quarter and aims to maintain profitability starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. This Zacks Rank #1 company is also eyeing international growth, with launches planned in Australia and Western Europe.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:16548a683094b:0-top-founder-run-company-stocks-that-can-drive-solid-returns/
"Jon Voight, Hollywood coalition asks Trump to consider tax incentives",1747086230000,"A coalition of American film industry unions and guilds, joined by veteran actor Jon Voight, has asked U.S. President Donald Trump to consider implementing tax incentives in his push to promote domestic film productions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. Along with Voight, the letter was signed by Sylvester Stallone and Teamsters union general president Sean O'Brien, among others. They call for Trump to support the inclusion of three film-friendly tax measures in a reconciliation package being drafted in Congress. Voight and Stallone were also appointed by Trump as special ambassadors to Hollywood to strengthen the industry and bring filmmaking back to the country.""Returning more production to the United States will require a national approach and broad-based policy solutions, including those we propose below as well as longer term initiatives such as implementing a federal film and television tax incentive,"" the letter read. Major media companies, including Walt Disney NYSE:DIS , Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX and Universal Pictures NASDAQ:CMCSA , film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain as governments around the world introduce credits and rebates to attract film productions. Trump threw the entertainment industry into a flux earlier this month when he announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering.The move left a lot of questions unanswered, such as when the duties would be implemented and how they would be enforced — as different components of a film are made in different countries and then assembled through post-production. Trump's tariff pronouncement followed his meeting with Voight along with other executives and advisers to mull a range of ideas to to revive domestic film and TV production, including federal tax incentives.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK1SD:0-jon-voight-hollywood-coalition-asks-trump-to-consider-tax-incentives/"
CEOs Are Saying These 2 Ominous Words on Earnings Calls More Than Ever — Barrons.com,1746025860000,"By Sabrina EscobarTariffs are top of mind for U.S. corporate executives, as evidenced by their comments during first-quarter earnings season, now roughly at its midpoint.The assessments of the 50 or so S&P 100 companies that had reported through Tuesday morning varied greatly, however. Some companies offered a detailed analysis of the negative impact tariffs would have, while others said they weren't yet concerned.Barron's combed through the earnings-call transcripts of these companies with the assistance of AlphaSense, and found a 132% increase in mention of ""tariffs"" in the past 90 days compared with the previous quarter, and a 20% increase in the word ""uncertainty,"" presumably resulting from the Trump administration's tariff policy, unveiled April 2.That lack of certainty is already creating shock waves through the economy by pausing business activity, shaking consumer confidence, and hampering companies' ability to make projections for the year ahead.""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years, so the only thing we're certain of is we don't know which, if any, of our scenarios will play out,"" said Carol Tomé, CEO of UPS, on a call with investors Tuesday. (""Uncertainty"" cropped up 22 times throughout the course of UPS' earnings call.)Here are seven other takeaways from earnings season so far:Economic MayhemInvestors were anxious to hear company commentary about how tariffs would affect the economy at large. Many executive teams obliged them, largely noting that higher levies would have a negative impact on the economy. Most, however, added a caveat that the effects won't be evident until the tariff levels are settled.""The simple truth today is that we don't yet know where trade policy will settle, nor do we know what the actual transmission effects will be on the real economy,"" said Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, adding that the consensus among economists is for softer growth this year.Goldman Sachs' expectation for growth in the U.S. has fallen ""meaningfully"" to 0.5% from over 2%, said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, adding that the prospect of a recession had increased.Bank of New York Mellon CEO Robin Vince had a similar message: ""The read-through of this uncertainty into both capital markets and the real economy creates elevated risks in the near- and medium-term,"" he said.All Eyes on the Consumer...Given that spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, it isn't surprising that businesses are tracking consumer activity as they make their forecasts for the year. The general gist is that consumers are hanging in there, but tariff anxiety is driving their spending.Some Americans are pulling their spending forward to try to get ahead from tariffs. Others have halted shopping altogether until they have more clarity on the tariff environment.""The consumer has been hit with a lot, and that's a lot to process. So, what we're seeing, I think, is a logical response from the consumer to pause,"" said Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten.Wealthier Americans may be an exception. American Express, which caters to higher-income consumers, said that the company isn't seeing any changes to shopping behavior.""Our card members may say they don't have any confidence in the economy, but they still continue to spend,"" said American Express CEO Stephen Squeri....And BusinessesSeveral companies noted that the uncertainty surrounding tariffs is making businesses hesitant about investment decisions. That means they are delaying stocking up on inventory (or in some cases, overstocking), hiring, and dealmaking.""Everyone would like less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy, and that's what we're hearing from clients,"" Goldman Sach's Solomon said. ""They want to understand where the policy will settle out so that they can make capital decisions, investment decisions, planning decisions.""Even technology companies that derive a big chunk of their revenue from services, rather than hardware, could see a slowdown as policy settles.""In the near term, uncertainty may cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach,"" said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna. He added that the company's consulting business was also ""more susceptible"" to discretionary pullbacks and government cuts.Small and medium-size businesses could be big drivers of the pullback in spending. Many source directly from China, and while they are working with manufacturers to move to different countries, they don't have the size advantage or financial flexibility that bigger players do to diversify their supply chain, UPS's Tomé said.Creative GuidanceAll the uncertainty has made it hard for companies to make accurate projections for the year ahead, and as a result, ""S&P 500 companies have gotten creative with how they are talking about the future,"" notes Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management.PepsiCo aimed to rerate investor expectations from the get-go and lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing more volatility ahead and a subdued consumer environment. Some firms decided to do away with guidance altogether, including airlines American, Southwest, and Alaska. General Motors pulled its profit guidance for 2025, saying the prior forecast ""can't be relied upon.""Most companies, however, maintained guidance for the year. Some of these, such as science-equipment producer Danaher, said their guidance was unchanged because they believe they can completely offset the projected tariff impact. Others, like defense and aerospace giant RTX, maintained guidance but noted that tariff impacts weren't factored into their outlook for the year.3M executives reiterated its earnings guidance, but said tariffs could crimp earnings per share by anywhere from 20 cents to 40 cents a share, barring any mitigation strategies.Even in the midst of the chaos, there were still a few guidance raises. AbbVie tweaked its adjusted earnings per share guidance higher — but it doesn't reflect any shifts in trade policy, including the potential for pharmaceutical-specific tariffs.""It's premature to speculate on the impact, and once we have that information, we'll communicate at the appropriate time,"" said AbbVie CEO Robert Michael. Other healthcare also companies refrained from making sweeping guidance changes until the sector's tariffs are completed.Mitigation, Mitigation, MitigationCompanies are pursuing a host of initiatives to soften the tariff blow. The main efforts are tied to shuffling about supply chains, including diversifying countries of origin and sourcing products in the U.S.Firms are also negotiating with vendors to try to share the burden of higher import costs, and trimming costs across the business to redirect toward the import tax. Hasbro, for instance, said it was accelerating its cost-cutting program and is now aiming to save $175 million to $225 million this year.If all else fails, most will resort to an age-tested solution: raising prices.The problem — as Colgate-Palmolive CEO Noel Wallace explained — is that if consumer demand falls, companies will have less wiggle room to hike prices.""The pricing environment will continue to be challenging, I think, in terms of where things go now,"" Wallace said. ""As tariffs take hold, I think everyone will be looking for ways to create value in the category that will be principally driven, in my view, through innovation. But there will be some pricing that will have to take place in certain markets around the world.""Business-facing enterprises may have more flexibility to increase prices than consumer-facing ones.All Good HereWhile most companies were bracing investors for the havoc that accompanies higher tariffs, a lucky few indicated they weren't too concerned about the levies.Telecommunications firms, for instance, felt confident that consumers weren't going to shut down their phone lines, and that they would be able to pass on any phone price increases to the consumer.""Whenever I get asked about the economy, my first answer is we're not really the people to ask,"" said Mike Sievert, CEO at T-Mobile. ""I mean, we're probably the least canary in your coal mine because people feel so strongly about this category that we'll find a way to keep paying their bills.""Netflix's executive team struck a confident tone as well, noting that home entertainment becomes ""really important"" to households in tougher economies.Renewable energy provider NextEra Energy estimates that tariffs will affect capital spend for its energy resource segment by less than 0.2%, which could even be negotiated down to zero.""When I think about where we stand, I feel very good about tariffs. It's just not going to have much of an impact at all on our business,"" said CEO John Ketchum.We're Talking to TrumpSome companies sought to reassure investors that they were engaging with the administration to eke out the best deal for the industry.""I don't think a day goes by where we aren't engaged with someone in the administration, including cabinet secretaries and up to POTUS himself,"" said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg.""So we're spending a lot of time making sure the administration understands the implications of either short-term or long-term tariffs on not just our company, but the overall aviation industry here in the U.S.,"" he added.That said, firms are toeing a fine line between advocating for softer tariffs, and staying on the president's good side.""We have been, I think, full-throated in our support of the administration's efforts to support American competitiveness and revitalize American manufacturing. We're well-aligned in that regard,"" said GE Aerospace CEO Lawrence Culp. ""But it's easy to overlook the $75 billion trade surplus the sector enjoys largely on the back of this tariff-free regime that we've had since 1979. So, all we have suggested, as the administration works through a myriad of issues, is that they consider the position of strength that the country enjoys as a result of this tariff-free regime and to consider re-establishing the same.""Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla to Debut Self-Driving Taxi in June as Robotaxi Wars Begin,1747080000000,"Disrupt or be DisruptedTechnological advances are always at the heart of disruption on Wall Street, and thus, the most profitable long-term trend opportunities. However, it will mean a slow, painful death for companies who fail to adapt and evolve. Conversely, the rewards are substantial for companies that respond to market changes and debut new technologies. For instance, Blockbuster Video did little to adapt when Netflix ( NFLX ) first began its mail-order DVD service (which later morphed into a streaming service). The result? Blockbuster went bust, and Netflix would become one of the best-performing stocks of the 2000s.Why Robotaxis are Taking OverOver the past few months, the idea of autonomous vehicles has gone from dream to reality. Advancements in artificial intelligence, software, cameras, and sensors have made this possible. Robotaxis provide several benefits, including:- Safety: Drive on the road for more than a half hour in any major US city and you are likely to witness at least one driver glancing down at their Apple ( AAPL ) Pphone. Robotaxis promise to reduce human error and distraction, reducing the number of accidents. - Cost Reduction: By eliminating the need for human drivers, ride-hailing operators can become far more profitable. - More Vehicles: Because robotaxis don’t need to take breaks like humans (outside of recharging), they can run nearly 24/7, increasing the number of vehicles on the road, improving customer wait times while increasing profitability.The Robotaxi Wars are HereThus far, Alphabet’s ( GOOGL ) “Waymo” service is the undisputed king of robotaxis. Waymo is the first major robotaxi player to gain regulatory clearance, operates in four US cities (with plans to add two more), and its paid robotaxi business has exploded to more than 250,000 paid rides per week. Meanwhile, Waymo has inked a strategic partnership with Uber Technologies ( UBER ), operator of the most-extensive ride-sharing application and network.Tesla Will Enter the Robotaxi Market in JuneWhile Tesla ( TSLA ) and its visionary CEO Elon Musk, are behind in the robotaxi wars, the race to robotaxi supremacy is in the early innings. Musk has said several times over that past few years that he is “betting the company” on autonomous vehicle technology and believes that robotaxis will revolutionize transportation and potentially increase the value of a Tesla by fivefold. Though Tesla’s robotaxi debut has been delayed several times, Tesla has finally begun testing its robotaxi service with employees in Austin, Texas. Next month, Tesla will start to roll out its robotaxi to customers through its in-house built mobile application.Waymo vs. Tesla: Who Will Win the Robotaxi War? Waymo has an early advantage in the robotaxi war. While Tesla has yet to launch, Waymo is a proven entity that is well on its way to reaching scale. That said, it is far too early to count Tesla out. A critical difference between Waymo and Tesla robotaxis is cost. Waymo autonomous vehicles are far more expensive than Tesla robotaxis. Because Waymo leverages expensive LiDAR, radar, cameras, and AI, it can cost about $180,000! Conversely, Tesla robotaxis will only rely on computer vision AI, costing about $50,000 to produce.Image Source: @teslaownersvIn other words, while Tesla is behind in the robotaxi race, its lower cost could allow it to catch up in scale and also enjoy jucier profit margins in the long run.Bottom LineWhile Waymo currently holds a significant lead, Tesla’s impending entry (with game-changing cost advantage) injects uncertainty into the future landscape of autonomous transportation. It means the robotaxi wars may just be starting.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:aba92c91b094b:0-tesla-to-debut-self-driving-taxi-in-june-as-robotaxi-wars-begin/
The Trade Desk vs. Magnite: Which Ad Tech Stock is the Smarter Buy?,1746025560000,"The Trade Desk, Inc. TTD and Magnite, Inc. MGNI are players in the digital advertising technology space. TTD operates a leading demand-side platform, which aids advertisers in focusing on data-driven advertising. Magnite is a supply-side platform (SSP) that helps publishers manage and sell their ad inventory across various formats like streaming, online video, display and audio. Digital advertising spend is expected to be driven by increasing mobile penetration, social media platforms, and programmatic advertising. Per a report from Grand View Research, the global digital advertising market is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030. The report further added that digital advertising will continue to be dominated by video as brands understand the effectiveness of visual storytelling.This uptrend in spending benefits both TTD and MGNI. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in digital advertising, which stock stands out?Let us delve a little deeper into the companies’ strengths and weaknesses to see which is the better stock pick.The Case for TTDTTD is benefiting from a significant increase in digital spending in key areas, such as Connected TV (CTV) and retail media. In the fourth quarter of 2024, The Trade Desk reported a record-breaking spend of more than $12 billion on its platform, signaling continued growth in advertiser demand. The Trade Desk also introduced its Ventura Operating System for CTV, designed to drive greater efficiency and transparency in CTV advertising. This operating system enables better data management, allowing TTD to enhance its targeting capabilities, which are crucial as the CTV market expands.The acquisition of Sincera, a leading digital advertising data company, will aid in enhancing its programmatic advertising platform by integrating Sincera’s actionable insights on data quality. The Trade Desk is actively simplifying its platform to be more intuitive without compromising sophistication, which should improve client onboarding and retention. At the same time, the company is aggressively integrating AI across all its operations to cater to the evolving needs of its clients amid the AI boom. While Kokai is expected to replace Solimar entirely by the end of 2025, TTD currently maintains two platforms, leading to operational difficulties. Any delays in Kokai adoption could impact performance and reduce upsell opportunities. Despite strong demand for its ad-buying platform, the company faced challenges from shifting market conditions and competitive pressures. Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions do not augur well for TTD, as these could squeeze ad budgets. The intensely competitive nature of the digital advertising industry, dominated by industry giants like Google and Amazon continues to put pressure on TTD’s market positioning.The Case for MGNIMagnite is gaining from robust growth in CTV, with contributions excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (ex-TAC) from CTV increasing 19% year over year for 2024. For the full year, it generated contribution ex-TAC of $607 million and processed ad spend of over $6 billion. The growth is being driven by increased ad spend and programmatic adoption by leading giants like Walmart, Disney, Fox, Roku, LG, Vizio, Warner, Discovery, and Paramount. On the last earnings call, MGNI highlighted Netflix ’s NFLX ad ramp as a significant business opportunity. Netflix is focused on expanding its global ad tier and corresponding ad revenues. MGNI expects Netflix to be a key programmatic partner as they boost the rollout of their ad platform in 2025. Given the momentum, MGNI expects contribution ex-TAC growth of over 10% or mid-teens (excluding political) in 2025. Strong growth in Live sports is another tailwind. Its expanded deal with Disney now includes live sports, international markets and podcasts, with Disney inventory also integrated into ClearLine. It is also bolstering its international sports business by expanding its partner base with additions of new partners like FIFA and Sky New Zealand. The addition of more generative AI-powered tools in 2025 is expected to expected to drive operational efficiencies and enable new monetization opportunities. MGNI’s SpringServe ad server and streaming SSP platform are its main catalysts. As MGNI does not resell inventory, its technology has enabled direct relationships with virtually all major streaming platforms except YouTube, allowing reach to 92 million U.S. and 75 million EMEA households. Moreover, ClearLine and SpringServe are driving MGNI’s agency marketplaces, which are used by firms like GroupM and Horizon. These marketplaces enable end-to-end solutions and more efficient media spend for these agencies. These tools are strategically important for MGNI, creating sticky relationships with agencies and advertisers. The company’s tech stack initiatives have helped it reduce costs per ad request in 2024. For DV+, the costs per ad have reduced by 26%, and for CTV, it has come down by 45%. However, as with all firms operating in this space, competitive pressure, especially from tech behemoths, is enormous, along with macroeconomic uncertainty that could threaten ad budgets. Also, MGNI’s DV+ (display, video, and mobile) business underperformed in the fourth quarter of 2024, mainly due to a post-election unusual spending patterns. Though MGNI added that the business has rebounded across verticals, the volatility can be a concern. Also, its heavy reliance on CTV business increases business risk. Higher expenses could weigh down on profitability. Share Performance for TTD & MGNIBoth TTD and MGNI shares have suffered from tech sell-off due to the escalating trade war situation.

Buy 5 Stocks That Have Survived April's Tariff-Led Market Mayhem,1745928720000,"Wall Street has seen severe volatility in April owing to the imposition of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and trade-related policies. With just two days of trading left, most of the major stock indexes are trading in negative territory month to date. A large section of economists and financial researchers have warned of a near-term recession too. Trade-related negotiations are ongoing between the Trump administration and several other important nations. Stock prices of a long list of corporate behemoths have tumbled in April. Although we are not out of the woods so far, a sliver line is visible.A handful of corporate bigwigs (market capital > $50 billion) have survived April’s Wall Street turmoil. Stock prices of these companies have provided positive returns (> 5%) month to date. We recommend five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.These are: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Newmont Corp. NEM, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. AEM and Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last seven days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Netflix Inc.Netflix handsomely beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for bottom line while the top line was mostly in line with the consensus mark in first-quarter 2025. Despite trade and tariff-related doldrums, NFLX seems to have maintained healthy engagement levels. NFLX reaffirmed its 2025 guidance irrespective of the possibility of a near-term recession.The primary reason for positive revenue and earnings estimates revisions by brokerage firms is the strong visibility of NFLX’s business. On April 1, Netflix launched its Ad Suite in the United States. The company will ramp up this Ad Suite in international markets in the ensuing second quarter. The ad-supported offerings will enable management to witness impressive subscribers and ARPU (average revenue per user) growth. Netflix’s policies of offering ad-supported lower-prices tier, abolishing password sharing and effective price increase, should help it to become a defensive play ahead of a possible economic downturn. Furthermore, Netflix uses artificial intelligence (AI), data science and machine language (ML) extensively to provide consumers with more appropriate and intuitive suggestions. Netflix's AI platform takes into account an individual’s viewing habits and hobbies and accordingly provides recommendations. NFLX’s AI model compiles subscriber information and recommends content based on their preferences, which can be customized by end users. AI applications enable NFLX to offer high-quality streaming service at reduced bandwidths. Netflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14% and 27.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.8% over the last seven days. Newmont Corp.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. NEM is likely to gain from several projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest also created an industry-leading portfolio and provided opportunities for significant synergies. NEM also remains focused on improving operational efficiency and returning value to shareholders.Newmont has received full funds approval for its Ahafo North project and the project has reached the execution stage. Commercial production for the project is expected to commence in second-half 2025. NEM remains committed to Ghana, investing $950 million to $1,050 million in development capital for Ahafo North. Newmont has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.9% and 16.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last seven days. Philip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris has benefited from strong pricing power and an expanding smoke-free product portfolio. PM has been making significant progress with its smoke-free transition, with products like IQOS and ZYN contributing to strong performance. In fact, PM aims to become substantially smoke-free by 2030.Philip Morris is set for another year of robust growth in 2025, driven by increasing demand across all product categories. PM anticipates positive volume growth for the fifth consecutive year, with an expected increase of 2%. Smoke-free products remain a key growth driver, projected to expand by 12-14%, reinforcing PM’s strategic shift toward reduced-risk alternatives.Philip Morris has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.3% and 13.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.9% over the last seven days. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd.Agnico Eagle Mines is focused on executing projects that are expected to provide additional production growth. The Kittila expansion promises cost savings, while acquisitions like Hope Bay and the merger with Kirkland Lake Gold strengthen its market position. Merger with Kirkland Lake Gold established the new AEM as the industry's highest-quality senior gold producer. Higher gold prices are also expected to drive AEM’s margins. AEM’s strategic diversification mitigates risks, supported by prudent debt management and maintaining financial flexibility.Agnico Eagle Mines has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.9% and 33.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.8% over the last seven days. Spotify Technology Spotify Technology provides audio streaming services worldwide. SPOT operates through two segments — Premium and Ad-Supported. The Premium segment offers unlimited online and offline streaming access to its catalog of music and podcasts without commercial breaks to its subscribers. The Ad-Supported segment provides on-demand online access to its catalog of music and unlimited online access to the catalog of podcasts to its subscribers on their computers, tablets, and compatible mobile devices. SPOT also offers sales, distribution and marketing, contract research and development, and customer support services.In the last reported quarter, total Monthly Active Users (MAUs) were 675 million versus the consensus estimate of 665.25 million. Ad-Supported MAUs were 425 million against the consensus estimate of 420.15 million. Premium Subscribers came in at 263 million compared to the consensus estimate of 259.99 million.Spotify Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.8% and 75.8%, respectively, for the current year.

"Fox names new streaming service 'Fox One', plans launch before football season",1747052048000,"Fox Corp NASDAQ:FOX said its new subscription-based streaming service will be called ""Fox One"" and is set to launch before the fall American football season as the company seeks to reach audiences beyond its mainstay cable television business.Unveiling details on Monday about the service first announced in February, Fox said pricing for ""Fox One"" would align with its wholesale rates and would not be at a discount.Shares of the company rose 5% as it also surpassed quarterly revenue expectations, thanks to a surge in advertising sales driven by its broadcast of ""Super Bowl LIX"" in February.The Murdoch family-controlled company has largely sat out the streaming race, betting instead on ad revenue from its free Tubi streaming service that has about 97 million monthly active users.Fox will partner with other distributors and services to offer Fox One, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, hinting at potential bundling deals with other streamers — a strategy that has gained traction as companies look to curb subscriber churn.""The pricing will be healthy,"" Murdoch said.Launching the service ahead of the NFL season should drive good initial uptake, regardless of price, said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. But he flagged doubts about how many streaming services the market could sustain.In the March quarter, more advertisers turned to the owner of FOX News, FOX Sports and Tubi to tap its growing viewership. An estimated 127.7 million viewers tuned in for the Super Bowl championship broadcast by Fox, the largest audience in TV history for a single-network telecast. Revenue rose 27% to $4.37 billion in the third quarter, beating an estimate of $4.18 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Advertising revenue surged 65%. Adjusted profit per share of $1.10 beat an estimate of $0.91 per share.FOX News now has more than 200 new advertisers since U.S. Election Day. ""They're sticking on our air and continue to advertise,"" Murdoch said.LightShed Partners expects FOX News will be the ""biggest beneficiary"" in this year's TV advertising upfronts, which are annual events where TV networks and streaming platforms present their upcoming programming to advertisers.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3RK11T:0-fox-names-new-streaming-service-fox-one-plans-launch-before-football-season/"

New Tariffs Hit Film Industry—What It Means for Netflix,1747048500000,"There are no clear-cut answers in today’s uncertain stock market, as President Trump's recently rolled-out trade tariffs start to hit industries that weren’t considered targets for these trading headwinds. When the announcements started, the attention seemed to be centered on the  technology sector , specifically the semiconductor and chipmaking industry in Asian regions. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] However, these tariffs quickly spilled over into the retail sector and, most recently, into entertainment . As some countries have made little effort to work around a deal with the United States, President Trump has come up with more creative ways to force the market into negotiations, with his latest strategic round of tariffs focused on the movie industry . After announcing a 100% tariff on foreign-made films , all eyes suddenly turned to one stock.Shares of Netflix Inc. NASDAQ:NFLX have been on a tear for the entire year, as investors believe that this subscription business could outweigh the volatility brought on by trade tariffs due to its fundamental strengths and the ability of management and analysts to forecast earnings and revenues into the future, aiding in better outlooks and valuations in the future. Here are some angles investors can consider for Netflix on this new development.Price Action: Netflix’s Latest SeriesOver the past 12 months, Netflix's stock delivered a massive 88.8% rally to outperform most of its peers and the broader S&P 500 . This reiterates the fact that as volatility and uncertainty hit the broader financial markets, Netflix was able to attract the attention and preference of investors due to its value proposition .However, over the past week, Netflix stock declined by as much as 4% on the news of these 100% movie tariffs . Even with this adverse reaction initially, there are a few things to consider for the future of the stock that might create more stability and positive outlooks in the coming months and quarters.Costs should be kept front and center when strategizing the potential scenarios that might come from these 100% tariffs, but here’s where the broader market participants think the stock could go next. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:NFLX] Institutions Are Okay With Uncertainty; Here’s WhyEven as Netflix's costs are set to rise , since a growing share of series and movies are produced internationally, not to mention a growing base of foreign users, there seems to be one clear advantage that Netflix can implement in the face of this new situation it has found itself in.With such a massive presence in the entertainment industry, not to mention its large market share and growing footprint across the globe , Netflix has a few ways to get around these new tariffs. One of the first, but not so obvious, is that Netflix can simply insource production in the United States for foreign creators to avoid some of these tariffs.Doing this would absolutely help the company in two ways. First, it can offset some of the significant added costs associated with importing foreign films. Second, it can gain political goodwill by bringing more production and exposure to the American scenery. This would mean added investment in the country , which might bring on potential grants and credits . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] That one can be a little complicated because it rests on many assumptions and multiple-choice options for the company and other producers. A more straightforward strategy might come from the brand’s leverage and pricing power , avoiding some of the hoops that need to be jumped through to onshore production and further logistics.This simpler alternative is to  raise prices , which might be seen as negative at first because the initial assumption is that higher prices will lower future demand. However, when investors zoom out, it isn’t just Netflix that has this problem; it is pretty much all the others in the entertainment industry .Knowing this, it becomes a race to see who is first to raise prices and lock in the additional audience before everyone else is either forced to take on the logistical onshoring or raise prices to avoid such heavy lifting. With both scenarios pointing to a Netflix win , it’s no surprise that some of the largest institutions warm up to owning more Netflix stock.Such as those from Natixis Advisors , who decided to boost their holdings in Netflix stock by 1% as of May 2025. While this may not sound like much on a percentage basis, it did bring the group’s net position to a high of $520.4 million today , giving investors another sign of confidence in the future , one that might be filled with one of these two assumptions moving forward.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:e3d26e2e5094b:0-new-tariffs-hit-film-industry-what-it-means-for-netflix/

Tariff uncertainty clouds outlook for US television's annual ad-selling bonanza,1747044000000,"The risk of a tariff-induced U.S. recession is hanging over the television industry's annual upfront selling season, when companies stage star-studded pitches to coax brands to commit to spending billions of dollars on advertising in the year ahead. Starting Monday, the presentations in New York kick off weeks of negotiations in which television networks and streaming services typically lock in the largest share of their ad revenue for the year. YouTube NASDAQ:GOOG promises a performance by Lady Gaga and an appearance from one of its biggest stars, Mr. Beast. NBCUniversal will host its presentation at Radio City Music Hall and Warner Bros. Discovery NASDAQ:WBD at Madison Square Garden.But the champagne-fueled parties will take place against a backdrop of economic concerns, stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policies, which economists warn may lead to a recession. While major media companies have not reported any decline in ad demand, industry analysts predict brands will reduce their spending as consumer confidence wanes.Research firm eMarketer projects ad spending on traditional television during the upfronts could fall to $13.4 billion, down $4 billion from last year, depending on the level of tariffs that take effect. The Trump administration is negotiating deals with a number of major trading partners, including China.For digital ads on online devices, the worst-case scenario is that spending will stay flat at around $13 billion, eMarketer said. If tariffs are limited, digital ads could rise to $14.7 billion.Data firm Guideline said a pullback was already evident. Ad spending rose 7% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2024, but future bookings suggest growth could decelerate to 3% in the second quarter, Guideline said. Media executives acknowledged some brands might feel nervous, but said there could be a cost to cutting ad spending.""Clients learned some important lessons during COVID, when a lot of advertisers pulled back very quickly and then had to redeploy those funds,"" said Jeff Collins, president of advertising sales, marketing and brand partnerships at Fox NASDAQ:FOX . ""And I think that they're trying not to have a knee-jerk reaction to what is happening now.""Advertisers that wait to purchase time at the last minute in the so-called ""scatter"" market sometimes pay double-digit percentage increases in rates, Collins said.Fox had not yet seen any impact on ad demand from tariffs, he added. Karen Kovacs, president of advertising sales and partnerships at NBCUniversal, said brands that continued to spend on advertising during past downturns maintained better sales and market share than others that cut back. NBCU parent Comcast NASDAQ:CMCSA , in its latest earnings report, said ad revenue was roughly flat during the first three months of 2025. BUYER'S MARKETSellers of ad time may need to give concessions on pricing and cancellation terms to win business, said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes, adding tariffs would have most impact on the advertising of physical products like cars and consumer goods.Digital players like Google's YouTube or Facebook parent Meta NASDAQ:META will likely emphasize the use of artificial intelligence to help brands reach customers more efficiently, said Greg Kahn, CEO of GK Digital Ventures media advisory firm.Many U.S. companies have cut or withdrawn their annual forecasts, citing an uncertain trade environment, including General Motors NYSE:GM , Kraft Heinz NASDAQ:KHC and bleach maker Clorox NYSE:CLX .Clorox is evaluating how much it spends on advertising, CEO Linda Rendle said on an earnings call last week.""We're going to continue to invest strongly in our brands, but at what level makes the most amount of sense given the returns that we're getting,"" Rendle said. Still, some media firms remain upbeat.Disney NYSE:DIS expects annual advertising growth to surpass its previous 3% forecast, while Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX co-CEO Greg Peters said in April the company was not seeing any signs of softness in its pre-upfronts discussions.The company does not disclose ad revenue, but analysts polled by LSEG project Netflix will bring in $2.7 billion from advertising in 2025. Netflix launched its ad-supported options in November 2022 and is still in the early stages of building that business. ""That smallness probably provides us some insulation to market shifts right now,"" Peters said, adding that Netflix expects to double ad revenue this year.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3R116L:0-tariff-uncertainty-clouds-outlook-for-us-television-s-annual-ad-selling-bonanza/"
Netflix's Ted Sarandos Says Cinemas Are Fading as Viewers Stay Home,1745869671000,"Netflix (NFLX, Financials) co-CEO Ted Sarandos said traditional moviegoing is falling out of favor as more people choose to watch films at home. Speaking at the 2025 TIME100 Summit in New York, Sarandos said Netflix is saving Hollywood by keeping audiences engaged with new content that might otherwise disappear.Sarandos said falling box office numbers show that consumers want flexibility, and Netflix meets that demand by letting people watch when and where they want. While he acknowledged some still enjoy the communal cinema experience, he called it an outmoded idea for most.He credited Netflix with making audiences more open to different genres, pointing to a recent event where a live chamber music performance celebrated the streaming hit Bridgerton .Sarandos also said the entertainment industry often gets sidelined in global trade deals, where companies like Netflix face stricter rules than other sectors. He argued entertainment should be treated like any other serious business.He warned that U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump, particularly tariffs, could shrink the international reach of American films and shows. His comments come as Chinas film regulator announced plans to limit the number of U.S. films shown in the country, citing American tariffs and warning of declining public support for U.S. entertainment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6b5d2d6b9094b:0-netflix-s-ted-sarandos-says-cinemas-are-fading-as-viewers-stay-home/
Netflix Wins Praise From Top Analyst for AI-Powered TV Interface Overhaul,1746813995000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX drew investor attention Friday after a well-known analyst backed the streaming platform's redesign of its TV interface, calling it a potential driver of stronger engagement and revenue.The platform's upgraded TV app now offers real-time, personalized recommendations based on a user's viewing and search habits. BMO Capital's five-star analyst Brian Pitz reaffirmed a ""Buy"" rating on the stock, highlighting how these updates could improve viewer retention, increase content discovery, and help drive advertising revenue.Pitz also pointed to Netflix's use of AI across both TV and mobile to enhance content suggestions. He said the more interactive format could support a broader user base and deepen customer stickiness.Addressing potential pressure from Trump-era tariffs on foreign-made content, Pitz said Netflix's diversified library and production footprint, spanning over 50 countries, could reduce exposure to those trade risks.In its most recent quarter, Netflix reported strong revenue growth, with Asia-Pacific up 23% year over year and EMEA rising 15%. Cost discipline also supported margins, with marketing expenses falling to $688 million from $976 million in the prior quarter.Shares of Netflix were down slightly in afternoon trading.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8367f4ebc094b:0-netflix-wins-praise-from-top-analyst-for-ai-powered-tv-interface-overhaul/
"Roku Gears Up to Report Q1 Earnings: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745850840000,"Roku ROKU is slated to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 1.For the first quarter of 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $1.005 billion, indicating an increase of 14% year over year. The company anticipates Platform revenues to grow 16% year over year, and Devices revenues are expected to remain flat year over year due to elevated inventory from lower holiday sales. It expects first-quarter total gross profit of $450 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13.96%.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Shaping Upcoming Results of RokuAs Roku prepares to report first-quarter 2025 earnings, investors should maintain a cautious stance. Despite strong Platform momentum in 2024, Devices revenues and gross profit were impacted by increased seasonal discounting across the industry, including at Roku. This resulted in an excess inventory position at the end of 2024, which is expected to have weighed slightly on gross margins in the first quarter of 2025.Platform growth remains healthy, with management estimating 16% year-over-year growth for the first quarter of 2025. Streaming services distribution and advertising activities both contributed to the expected increase, with advertising activities anticipated to grow faster than subscription revenues. However, the absence of political advertising spend compared to the fourth quarter, along with seasonal trends, might have tempered advertising momentum in the quarter under review.The Roku Channel continues to expand rapidly, reaching approximately 145 million people in the United States and delivering 82% year-over-year growth in Streaming Hours during the fourth quarter. Enhancements to the Roku Experience, including an AI-powered content row and expanded ad formats, such as Brand Showcases and Action Ads, are driving increased engagement and monetization. Nevertheless, macroeconomic uncertainty and competitive shifts in the ad market may present near-term volatility.Roku operates in an increasingly competitive advertising landscape, facing new pressures in the first quarter of 2025 as companies like Netflix NFLX, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD, and Disney DIS expand their ad-supported streaming offerings. The global reach, brand strength, and established advertiser relationships of these companies may have challenged Roku’s ability to capture ad budgets and sustain advertising momentum during the quarter under review.Roku’s international expansion into markets like Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom is expected to have driven user growth in the first quarter of 2025. However, as the company remains focused on scaling its international presence before prioritizing monetization, the immediate impact on revenues is expected to have been limited.Top-Line Growth Estimates for Q1The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average revenue per user is pegged at $42.09. The consensus mark for first-quarter 2025 Devices revenues is pegged at $127 million, and for Platform revenues, it is pinned at $877 million.ROKU Price Performance & Stock ValuationShares of Roku have lost 11.6% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 index’s decline of 4.9% and 6.4%, respectively.ROKU’s YTD Price PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, Roku currently trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 43.86X, which is at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 31.54X. While this valuation gap suggests that investors have high growth expectations for this stock, it is not a good pick for a value investor. A value score of D further reinforces an unattractive valuation for ROKU at this moment. Price-to-Cash Flow RatioInvestment ConsiderationsRoku continues to demonstrate strong platform fundamentals with robust user engagement, innovative Home Screen monetization, and healthy international expansion. However, investors should adopt a cautious stance ahead of first-quarter 2025 results. Elevated inventory levels and margin pressures from seasonal discounting in Devices, combined with intensifying competition in ad-supported streaming, may weigh on near-term performance. While Platform revenues are poised for double-digit growth and advertising activities remain a key strength, given Roku’s premium valuations and potential volatility in advertising trends, patience could reward investors seeking a more attractive entry point.ConclusionRoku’s platform growth trajectory remains healthy, but current valuations largely reflect its projected growth. With first-quarter gross margins pressured by excess holiday inventory, seasonal advertising trends normalizing, and competitive intensity rising in ad-supported streaming, investors should consider maintaining existing positions while awaiting a more favorable entry point. The company's innovations in Home Screen monetization and international expansion offer long-term upside, but prudent investors may benefit from patience ahead of first-quarter results.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6e3d95f2e094b:0-roku-gears-up-to-report-q1-earnings-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock/

Alphabet GOOGL gained 1.7% after the Google parent reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on both revenues and profits. Tesla TSLA surged 9.8%, while NVIDIA NVDA and Meta Platforms META also posted strong advances of 4.3% and 2.7%, respectively.Tesla shares jumped on April 25, extending their recent rally after CEO Elon Musk said he would spend more of his time focusing on Tesla, as the Trump administration is on its way to loosening rules around self-driving cars.The latest administrative move would favor Tesla, which has long promoted autonomous vehicles as key to its growth strategy. Tesla now expects to be selling fully autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, in June, with that business expanding to other cities this year and becoming financially material in the second half of 2026. For the week, Tesla surged 23.8%, Netflix NFLX jumped 11.9%, Amazon AMZN gained 11.6%, Apple AAPL added 8.4%, Microsoft MSFT advanced 8%, Meta surged 11.5%, and NVIDIA leaped 12.5%.Semiconductor stocks staged a massive surge last week as the space had been beaten down heavily. After Trump’s announcement of tariffs, chip biggies sank massively. Now, the cues of easing trade tensions have given the space a special edge at the time of revival.Future Outlook: MixedMeanwhile, market volatility has remained elevated. Uncertainty surrounds U.S.-China trade talks after China said on April 24 that there were no negotiations underway, following earlier U.S. signals suggesting a possible softening in stance.Despite the uncertainty around tariffs and trade, Citi analysts are growing more optimistic about the market's trajectory, the CNBC article noted. Citi believes that as long as the momentum in trade negotiations remains positive and monetary policy becomes more supportive , equities should continue to stabilize and grind higher in the coming months. Possible trade de-escalation and easy money are great for tech stocks.Top-Performing Technology ETFs in Focus Against this backdrop, below we highlight some winning tech-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of the last week.Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF TESL – Up 23.7%SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF XSD – Up 15.2%iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX – Up 13.2%First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund QTEC – Up 11.3%iShares US Technology ETF IYW – Up 10.2%First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN – Up 9.4%Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Tech ETF PSCT – Up 9.2%This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d019289dc094b:0-tech-sizzled-last-week-top-performing-etfs-in-the-sector/

Disney Stock Soars After Earnings. Why It's All About Abu Dhabi and Theme Parks. — Barrons.com,1746643560000,"By George Glover and Angela PalumboDisney stock was soaring Wednesday after the company beat Wall Street's earnings target and unveiled a plan to build a theme park in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.The House of Mouse reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.45 a share and revenue rose 7% from a year ago to $23.6 billion. Analysts expected an adjusted profit of $1.19 a share on revenue of $23.1 billion, according to a FactSet poll.In afternoon trading, shares jumped 9.7% to $101.15. The stock was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.2%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.Revenue for Disney's experiences segment, which includes its theme parks, rose 6% from a year ago to $8.9 billion. The Street was looking for $8.7 billion. The solid parks revenue growth could help to reassure investors, who had been fretting that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive up inflation and lead to Americans spending less on big-ticket items like vacations.Shortly after it posted earnings, the company announced it would build a park on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. It would be the company's seventh park and first in the Middle East.""This groundbreaking resort destination represents a new frontier in theme park development,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of the company's experiences division, said in a statement. ""Our resort in Abu Dhabi will be the most advanced and interactive destination in our portfolio.""The theme park, according to Disney's 10-Q filing, will be built and operated by Miral, a limited liability corporation in the UAE.Disney will license its intellectual property to Miral and will earn royalties based on the project's revenue. Disney didn't rdisclose a launch date or size of the theme park, according to the 10-Q filing.Miral, according to Disney, has developed several family destinations on Yas Island with American and European brands.""It is all their capital and we will get a royalty. So there isn't ownership. We own our IP and license it to them as essentially the arrangement,"" Disney management said on the earnings call.Disney runs its Japanese theme parks similarly. According to the company's most recent annual 10-K filing, Disney earns royalties on revenues generated by the Tokyo Disney Resort, which is owned and operated by Oriental Land, a third-party Japanese corporation.Disney's streaming division, which includes the Disney+ platform, added 2.5 million subscribers over the quarter ended March 31. Its operating profit rose to $336 million, up from $47 million a year earlier.Disney said it was expecting adjusted earnings of $5.75 a share for its current fiscal year, which ends in September, although it noted that it will be monitoring macroeconomic developments that could shift its outlook. Analysts had been forecasting earnings of $5.43 for the current fiscal year.The earnings beat ought to give the stock a much-needed boost. Disney stock has declined 8.9% in 2025, compared with a 4.9% drop for the S&P 500. Rivals Netflix and Comcast are up 29% and down 8.6%, respectively.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Tech Executives Are Starting to Talk Tariffs. What It May Mean for Apple, Amazon Earnings — Barrons.com",1745691240000,"By Angela PalumboTechnology companies are starting to talk about how Donald Trump's trade war may impact their business. We'll find out more as earnings keep coming next week, with tariffs top of mind.Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Apple, and Spotify are scheduled to report in the coming days. Investors will be listening closely to hear how the trade war may be disrupting supply chains and products shipped from China and other countries facing Trump's tariffs.Some tech companies have already discussed tariffs on earnings calls. But the situation is fluid with exemptions in place for some types of chips, hardware, and iPhones. Trump recently said that 145% on tariffs on Chinese goods would drop ""substantially,"" but the timing is unclear and companies face near-term disruptions in sales.Here's what some tech companies have said, providing a glimpse of what's to come.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet""We're obviously not immune to the macro environment. But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers.""Alphabet didn't mention tariffs on its earnings call Thursday, except indirectly in this quote from Pichai. The de minimis exemption had allowed lower cost packages to enter the U.S. without tariffs, but Trump ended that exemption. Alphabet could be hit if Chinese e-commerce firms like Shein and Temu pull back on ad spending.Meta (parent of Instagram and Facebook) and Amazon are in a similar boat: both generate considerable revenue from advertising. Amazon relies heavily on Chinese suppliers and retailers for its marketplace revenue, and Trump's tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods are certain to sting, along with higher duties on imports from other countries.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla""Tariffs are tough on a company when margins are still low.""Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, and Musk made it clear that despite his close relationship with the president, he's an advocate for ""free trade and lower tariffs."" A 25% tariff on imported cars and a 25% parts tariff are set to be implemented by early May.More notable is what Tesla didn't say: The company declined to update guidance for the rest of 2025, citing uncertainty around the impact of trade policy on the auto and energy supply chains.Tesla has far more protection from tariffs than other auto makers due to its large manufacturing base in North America; 85% of its vehicles comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to Benchmark Equity Research. Tesla stock is showing signs of life, rising 10% Friday on hopes for new products and the launch of robo-taxis in June.David Zinsner, CFO of Intel""We believe Q1 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior in anticipation of potential tariffs, though it is difficult to quantify the magnitude.""Intel reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Thursday, but gave disappointing second-quarter revenue guidance. Tariffs are causing uncertainty for the company and its customers, even as the Trump administration has put temporary exemptions on some tech products, like laptops. It seems that shoppers have started to take action to get ahead of potentially rising prices; that could bode poorly for the future.One read-through is that Apple may also top estimates, benefiting from accelerated sales of iPhones. Several Wall Street analysts have said they expect the iPhone maker could report better-than-expected revenue due to accelerated demand. The drawback: fewer phone upgrades in the months ahead.William McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow"" Yes, CEOs are mindful that the global economy is in a fluid state. No, they are not standing still.""ServiceNow is an enterprise software company that not only reported better-than-expected first-quarter financials on Wednesday, but also provided stronger-than-expected subscription revenue guidance.ServiceNow offers software solutions to businesses, including those powered by generative artificial intelligence. Companies have been willing to spend big on these software products to boost productivity. There's been worry on Wall Street that enterprises will start to cut back their IT budgets to get ahead of a potential economic slowdown. ServiceNow says that hasn't happened yet.Microsoft, which reports earnings on Wednesday, has a large software business through its Office family of apps. ServiceNow's confidence in the near-term could be a good sign for that part of Microsoft's business.Gregory Peters, Co-CEO of Netflix"" We're paying close attention, clearly, to the consumer sentiment and where the broader economy is moving. But based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.""Netflix was one of the first tech companies to report its financial results this earnings season. Shares of the streamer have been outperforming the market this year and the company issued a strong outlook.Entertainment isn't directly hit by tariffs, but a slowdown in consumer spending might trickle down: consumers may downgrade to lower-priced plans or cancel service, and Netflix has a growing ad business that could weaken. Netflix asserted on April 17 that it's still in a solid position.For now, it looks like consumers still want to spend on entertainment, which could bode well for other subscription based media platforms, like Spotify Technology. The music streamer is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Disney's Tariff Resilience Is a Surprise - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1746633600000,"By Dan GallagherThe Magic Kingdom hasn't lost its charm-even amid a trade war.Disney's share price jumped Wednesday morning after the entertainment giant posted surprisingly strong quarterly results. These included better-than-expected growth for its U.S. theme parks division, its biggest profit driver. Domestic parks operating income of $1.8 billion was 10% ahead of expectations, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.Investors had worried about Disney's exposure to the wide swath of tariffs unveiled by President Trump last month. Among other concerns, the announcements sparked fears of a sharp downtick in leisure travel, especially for visitors to the U.S. Trump's threat earlier this week to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the U.S. didn't help matters.Prior to Wednesday's report, Disney's share price was down nearly 6% from Trump's tariff unveiling on April 2, versus a 22% surge by Hollywood rival Netflix. Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino said Disney was ""priced like the sky is falling"" in an April 21 report.Wednesday report offered reassurance. Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said bookings for Disney World in Florida were up on the year for the quarters ending in June and September.Disney's Experiences business is also a global one, not just dependent on U.S. tourism. This was underscored by the surprise announcement of a new theme park in Abu Dhabi. Meantime, Chief Executive Bob Iger said Disney's massive new cruise ship sold out its first quarter of tickets ""in a matter of days.""The trade war isn't sinking Disney just yet.This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

S&P 500 Climbs Weekly as Tech Sector Leads Amid Positive Earnings,1745613626000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4.6% this week, led by technology stocks amid better-than-expected earnings from a number of companies in the sector including Google parent Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG . The S&P 500 ended Friday's session at 5,525.21. The index is still down 1.5% for the month and 6.1% this year on concerns about the economic impacts of the ongoing trade war between the US and several countries including China. Both Chinese officials and US President Donald Trump, however, softened their tone this week. US consumer sentiment waned for the fourth straight month in April as uncertainty around tariffs dampened expectations and pushed the year-ahead inflation outlook to the highest point since 1981, final results from the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed Friday. While the April reading of 52.2 was down from 57 in March, it was still above the consensus view for 50.5 in a poll compiled by Bloomberg. On the earnings front, Alphabet was in the spotlight as the Google parent not only released better-than-expected Q1 results but also said its board raised its quarterly dividend by 5% and authorized the repurchase of up to another $70 billion in class A and C shares. The company's shares rose by about 7% on the week. The technology sector had the largest percentage increase this week, climbing 7.9%, followed by a 7.4% gain in consumer discretionary and a 6.4% rise in communication services. Financials and industrials rose by about 3% each while materials added 2%. ServiceNow NYSE:NOW had the largest weekly percentage gain in the technology sector, jumping 22% as the company posted Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue above analysts' mean estimates. The company also forecast Q2 subscription revenue above the Street view at the time. In consumer discretionary, Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA shares climbed 18%. The electric vehicle maker's Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue both came in below Street views, but Chief Executive Elon Musk said he will recommit more of his time to the company. That was the ""biggest"" and ""best possible"" news investors could have heard, Wedbush analysts said in a note to clients. Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX was the top performer in communication services, rising 13% as the company's Q1 results and Q2 guidance both exceeded analysts' expectations. Consumer staples was the lone sector in the red for the week, dropping 1.4%. Kimberly-Clark NYSE:KMB had the largest percentage drop in consumer staples, falling 7.8%. The company reported Q1 adjusted earnings above the Street view but its revenue slightly missed analysts' mean estimate. Also, Kimberly-Clark reduced its guidance for 2025 adjusted earnings per share. Next week's earnings calendar features Visa (V), Coca-Cola (KO), Pfizer (PFE), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Mastercard (MA), McDonald's (MCD), Berkshire Hathaway NYSE:BRK.A , Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

Netflix Soars to All-Time High: 5 ETFs to Ride the Surge,1745596620000,"Netflix NFLX has reached a historic milestone, with its stock price soaring to an all-time high of nearly $1,101. This surge reflects the company’s robust performance and investor confidence in its growth trajectory, solidifying its position as a leader in the streaming industry. The solid trend is likely to continue given the company’s trillion-dollar ambition and analysts’ increasing target price.Investors seeking to tap the bullish trend should invest in ETFs with the largest allocation to this streaming giant. These are First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN, FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF FDND, MicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS, Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF GGME, and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC.What’s Driving Netflix Higher?Robust Q1 EarningsThe world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue estimates. The company reported earnings per share of $6.61, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69 and the year-ago earnings of $5.29. Revenues rose 13% year over year to $10.54 billion but were slightly below the consensus estimate of $10.55 billion. Netflix offered an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter. It expects revenues to grow 15% year over year to $11.04 billion, while earnings per share are expected to rise 44% to $7.03. The guidance is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.96 billion for revenues and $6.22 for earnings per share at the time of issuing the guidance (read: ETFs to Tap Netflix's Q1 Earnings Beat, Solid Growth Outlook).The company launched its in-house ad tech platform on April 1, with international expansion beginning this quarter. Management expects advertising revenue growth to double in 2025, signaling confidence in this relatively new business segment. Netflix reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance of $43.5-$44.5 billion. Trillion-Dollar StrategyNetflix aims to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by the end of the decade, a significant leap from its current valuation of approximately $466.8 billion. The company plans to double its annual revenues from $39 billion to $80 billion, fueled by its burgeoning ad-supported subscription model and international market expansion. Netflix also forecasts its global advertising revenues to grow to $9 billion by 2030.Netflix’s growth strategy includes expanding its content library, developing live programming options, enhancing its gaming division and building its advertising business. With total subscribers of more than 300 million, the company aims to increase this subscriber base to approximately 410 million by 2030 by focusing on international markets, such as India and Brazil, for much of this expansion.Defensive PlayNetflix has been viewed as a safe haven amid economic uncertainty created by President Donald Trump’s tariff policy. Its low-cost advertising-supported service plan should give it more resilience if the macroeconomic climate worsens, as tariffs will not directly impact TV shows and films (read: Inside Trump Tariffs and Their Impact on Sector ETFs). Analysts Lift Target PriceMost of the analysts raised the target price on Netflix this week, signaling bullish trends. Analysts from Morgan Stanley and Wedbush raised their price targets to $1,200 from $1,150, while Piper Sandler increased its target by $50 to $1,150. KeyBanc, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank also lifted their targets to $1,070, $1,000, $1,150 and $900, respectively, from the previous levels of $1,000, $955, $1,025 and $875.Following the earnings announcement, Guggenheim raised the target price from $1,100 to $1,150 while BMO Capital increased its target price to $1,200, highlighting the “multi-year durable ad growth opportunity” ahead. MoffettNathanson, Oppenheimer and Pivotal Research raised the price target to $1,150, $1,200 and $1,350, respectively, from $1,100, $1,150 and $1,250.Even cautious analysts like Barclays lifted the target price on Netflix to $1,000, noting that the streaming giant has become a “defensive long” investment in the current economic environment.ETFs in FocusFirst Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) : Netflix occupies the top spot at 10.6%. FT Vest Dow Jones Internet & Target Income ETF (FDND): Netflix occupies the top position at 10.7% share.MicroSectors FANG+ ETN (FNGS): Netflix accounts for nearly 10% share in the basket.Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF (GGME): Netflix is the top firm, accounting for 9.6% of the GGME assets.Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC): Netflix takes the third position at 7.5% share.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:8bd3b8a22094b:0-netflix-soars-to-all-time-high-5-etfs-to-ride-the-surge/
Amazon to spend $4 billion on cloud infrastructure in Chile,1746623400000,"Amazon's cloud computing division will invest $4 billion to build its first data centers and other cloud infrastructure in Chile, the company's head of South Latin America told Reuters.Amazon Web Services (AWS) expects the cloud region, its third in Latin America after Brazil and Mexico, to be operational by the second half of 2026.In an interview in Santiago on Tuesday, local head of AWS Juan Pablo Estevez said all the necessary permits had been given for the project, which would deliver ""substantial"" computing power for services like generative AI.The surge of data centers globally has caused concerns over energy and water use, which have been amplified in Chile as the country has suffered a drought for more than 15 years.Environmental concerns forced Google to rework plans for a $200 million data center in Chile after a local environmental court partially reversed its permit last September.Microsoft expects its cloud-computing Azure center in Chile to come online this year, according to its website. Estevez said Amazon's cloud region would use water to cool its servers just 4% of the year, the equivalent of about eight homes over a 15-year period, with air and evaporation technology used the rest of the time.He added that Amazon has been matching 100% of its energy consumption with renewable power since 2023.The company already has 36 regions and 114 availability zones worldwide used by companies such as Netflix, General Electric and Sony for storage, networking and remote security.Chilean retailer Cencosud, online retail giant MercadoLibre, and mining companies already use the company's other regional services, it said.Amazon's first-quarter cloud revenue and income forecast came in below estimates last Thursday, but Estevez said he's expecting strong growth in Chile and across the region.""The forecast is that the (Chile's) market will grow 20.3% year over year from now until 2028,"" he said, adding that the market was $1.5 billion last year and estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2025.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3RE0UJ:0-amazon-to-spend-4-billion-on-cloud-infrastructure-in-chile/"
"Should Netflix be One of the Mag 7, Replacing Tesla? ETFs in Focus ",1745582400000,"Shares of the Magnificent Seven (Mag 7) — NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT and Tesla TSLA — are under pressure this year, as trade tensions, AI disruption and demand swings shake confidence (read: 5 Resilient Tech ETFs Over the Past Month Amid Worsening Outlook).Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS has lost 16.7% so far this year (as of April 24, 2025). Among the seven players, Tesla Inc TSLA shares are the most beaten-down, plunging 31.6% as of the same date.Meanwhile, Netflix Inc. NFLX shares have advanced 23.7% this year. Netflix reported strong first-quarter 2025 results after the closing bell on April 17. The world's largest video-streaming company outpaced earnings estimates but slightly missed on revenues.Inside the Bullish Outlook of Netflix Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Netflix offers an upbeat outlook for the ongoing quarter and several analysts raised the target price on the stock, signaling bullish trends. Nine out of 11 analysts upped their earnings estimates for the upcoming quarter over the past seven days, while none cut estimates. Netflix’s earnings estimate for the June quarter stands at $7.05 per share, up from $6.22 recorded seven days ago.What’s Happening to Tesla?Zacks Rank # 4 (Sell) Tesla TSLA reported dismal first-quarter 2025 results this week, missing estimates for earnings and revenues. However, shares of Tesla jumped more than 5% in after-market hours (after reporting the earnings results) after CEO Elon Musk injected optimism by reaffirming the company’s goals for the launch of robotaxis and affordable vehicles. Musk’s promise to refocus on his business rekindled investor hopes.There has been no movement in earnings estimates for Tesla over the past seven days. However, seven out of 10 analysts cut their estimates over the past 30 days for the earnings of the upcoming quarter. Zacks Consensus Earnings estimate for Tesla for the June quarter stands at 57 cents, down from 63 cents over the past one-month period.Could Netflix be a More Suitable Candidate?As Tesla’s standing falters, streaming giant Netflix is emerging as a possible replacement, thanks to its strong earnings, subscriber growth, improving free cash flow, and solid guidance. Year to date, Netflix stock is in the green, defying the Mag-7 candidates.Netflix is known for its free cash flow strength. It reported $2.661 billion free cash flow (FCF) in Q1, up 24.5% year over year and 93% from the prior quarter. Moreover, its FCF margin shot up to 25.2% from 15% in Q4, implying NFLX stock could be worth much more. Netflix's revenue grew by just 12.5% year over year, but free cash flow (FCF) jumped 24.5% — from $2.137 billion to $2.661 billion — nearly twice as fast. This highlights strong operating leverage in action: as revenue increases, profitability scales even more rapidly.Valuation Comparison: Tesla Vs. NetflixTesla trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 99.34X (even after this year’s crash) compared with the past median value of 125.01X. Tesla’s P/FCF ratio stands at 254.66 times.In comparison, Netflix trades at a forward P/E of 44.77X (even after this year’s rally), much lower than the 10-year median value of 76.96X. Netflix’s P/FCF ratio stands at 69.24 times. This clearly explains that Netflix is undervalued.Netflix-Heavy ETFs in FocusInvestors who believe that Netflix shares deserve a spot in the tech elite club may play the stock in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) form, too. Netflix-heavy ETFs include single-stock funds like  T-Rex 2X Long NFLX Daily Target ETF  NFLU and  Direxion Daily NFLX Bull 2X Shares  NFXL.Some other Netflix-heavy ETFs are  MicroSectors FANG+ ETN  (FNGS) (Netflix has a 9.18% weight),  Invesco Next Gen Media and Gaming ETF  GGME (NFLX stock has an 8.80% weight) and  First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund  FDN (NFLX shares have a 9.19% weight).This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:56c89f25c094b:0-should-netflix-be-one-of-the-mag-7-replacing-tesla-etfs-in-focus/

Trump's movie tariff threat alarms India's film makers,1746605200000,"India's film industry, which earns roughly 40% of its overseas revenue from the United States, sounded the alarm this week about higher costs after President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of 100% on all movies produced beyond American soil.Film makers, producers and distributors in one of the world's largest film industries by output struggled to weigh the likely impact of such a tariff as Trump provided scant details, stirring more questions than answers.""The real question is how the term 'foreign produced' will be defined, and until that's clear, it's hard to say anything,"" said film maker Anubhav Sinha, known for his Netflix streaming series, ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"". ""It's not yet clear whether services like post-production will be affected.""India's film industry employs 272,000 people, with overseas box office takings of about 20 billion rupees ($237 million) in fiscal 2024, or a tenth of total earnings, Deloitte and studio grouping the Motion Picture Association said in a report.Key Hollywood films with India scenes are Oscar-winners such as the rags-to-riches tale ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and the Osama bin Laden manhunt thriller, ""Zero Dark Thirty"", along with rom-com ""Eat, Pray Love"", and Batman outing ""The Dark Knight Rises"". In the absence of details on the planned levy, film producers worry it could double the cost of exporting their films to the United States, where people of Indian descent are estimated to number 5.2 million.""The United States is one of the most important overseas markets for Indian cinema, largely due to the substantial diaspora,"" said producer Madhu Bhojwani, reponsible for hits such as ""Airlift"", on workers evacuated from Kuwait during the Gulf War. ""Any increase in ticket prices resulting from these tariffs would directly affect audience turnout, compounding the challenges posed by evolving consumer behaviour and broader industry headwinds.""The cost-effective South Asian nation has also grown in stature as Hollywood's preferred hub for on-ground production and post-production services, especially in visual effects, since it offers a skilled talent pool.""Almost 10 to 15 (foreign) movies are shot in India every year, and our movie industry will be impacted very badly,"" said film trade analyst Komal Nahta. LIKELY HIT TO REVENUEProminent Indian actor and producer Prakash Raj called Trump's move ""tariff terrorism"".If the tariff covers post-production services, the consequences will be bigger, added Bhojwani, the co-founder of Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures.""We can expect a potential decline in outsourced work from U.S. studios to Indian vendors, which could have notable implications for the Indian media services sector,"" she said. ""If revenue from the U.S. drops, it could affect budget planning and profitability for Indian production houses,"" said Pradeep Dwivedi, chief executive of Eros International Media NSE:EROSMEDIA .""Big-budget films counting on overseas revenue could be restructured or scaled back.""The move will also hurt smaller releases in the United States.""Even a 30% drop in revenue for such mid-scale movies would be a significant dent,"" said Raj Kandukuri, producer of a well-regarded film, ""Pelli Choopulu"", in India's southern language of Telugu. ""There are a sizeable number of students in the United States who watch movies, they will not spend high on ticket prices.""The planned levy might also drive a broader shift to digital platforms.""U.S. distributors might be less inclined to pick up Indian titles due to the increased cost,"" Dwivedi said.""This could result in fewer screens, smaller releases, and a shift toward digital platforms instead of theatrical. The tariff would likely accelerate a move toward direct-to-digital releases on platforms like ErosNow, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.""

"Roku Introduces New Device Line-Up: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1745510820000,"Roku ROKU has unveiled new streaming devices and software updates, improving the “Roku Experience” for more than 90 million households. Innovations include personalized content discovery, a new “Coming Soon to Theaters” row, and streamlined sports highlights, making TV more tailored to each viewer.The company also introduced its most compact streaming sticks, upgraded Roku-made TVs, and expanded into smart home tech with battery-powered indoor and outdoor cameras. Roku’s Smart Home OS and new Smart Projector design aim to increase user engagement. These innovations are part of Roku’s broader strategy to make streaming simpler, more connected, and more enjoyable, while continuing to grow its presence in the global home entertainment and smart device markets.Why ROKU’s New Launches Deserve AttentionRoku’s device segment faced significant challenges in the fourth quarter of 2024, as weak holiday demand and excess inventory led to aggressive discounting, pressuring profit margins. While the company anticipates a return to normal margins in 2025, near-term device profits are expected to remain flat despite potential sales growth.This makes Roku’s latest product launches especially timely. The introduction of compact streaming sticks, upgraded Roku TVs, and smart home devices is aimed at reigniting sales momentum and expanding user engagement. These innovations not only improve the overall “Roku Experience” but also help differentiate the brand in a crowded market, positioning Roku to recover from recent setbacks and continue growing its platform business.ROKU’s Financial Performance and MilestonesRoku hit a major milestone in the fourth quarter of 2024, crossing $1 billion in platform revenues for the first time, which was up 25% year over year. The company ended the year with 89.8 million global streaming households, gaining 4.3 million in the fourth quarter alone. Roku passed 90 million households in early January 2025 and aims to reach 100 million soon through continued platform growth and global expansion.User engagement also climbed, with total streaming hours rising 18% year over year to 34.1 billion in the fourth quarter and reaching 127.1 billion for 2024. The Roku Channel stood out, with an 82% surge in streaming hours, now reaching about 145 million U.S. viewers. It remains the #3 app on the platform by reach and engagement, helping drive Roku’s ad-supported revenue momentum.ROKU Offers Promising Guidance for 2025For 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $4.61 billion, indicating 12% year-over-year growth. Platform revenues are anticipated to reach $3.95 billion, suggesting an increase of 12% year over year. Excluding political ad spending, this suggests 15% growth, slightly above the 2024 rate.Roku projects an adjusted EBITDA of $350 million for 2025, indicating a 35% increase from the 2024 level. This demonstrates improving profitability as the company scales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.59 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 11.58%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pinned at 1 cent per share, which has been revised upward from a loss of 26 cents per share over the past seven days. Roku’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 55.07%See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.ROKU Faces Intense Competition in AdvertisingRoku operates in a highly competitive advertising industry and competes for revenues with other companies that have launched ad-supported streaming. Some of these companies include Netflix NFLX, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD and Disney DIS. Since its launch, Netflix’s ad-supported tier reached 70 million global monthly users as of late 2024, while Warner Bros. Discovery expanded its ad-supported tier on Max to more than 45 countries in the past 15 months. As of January this year, Disney had approximately 157 million global monthly active users watching ad-supported content across its streaming platforms. If Roku is unable to improve its own platform’s capabilities to face the increasing competition, both business and growth prospects of the company may be harmed.Stock Price Performance and Valuation of ROKUIn the year-to-date period, Roku shares have plunged 20.3%, underperforming the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 7% and the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s growth of 9.3%. Shares of its competitors Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney have lost 24.7% and 22.7%, respectively, while Netflix has gained 16.7%.ROKU’s YTD Price PerformanceFrom a valuation perspective, Roku currently trades at a price-to-cash flow ratio of 41.78X, which is at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 30.28X. While this valuation gap suggests that investors have high growth expectations for this stock, it is not a good pick for a value investor. A value score of D further reinforces an unattractive valuation for ROKU at this moment. ROKU Is Trading at a PremiumConclusion: Hold ROKU Stock for NowDespite recent margin pressures in its device segment and fierce competition in the ad-supported streaming space, Roku’s long-term outlook remains promising. The company is making smart investments in product innovation, platform enhancements, and international expansion, all of which aim to increase user engagement and grow monetization. Its strong growth in platform revenues, rising streaming hours, and expanding user base reflect a scalable business model. However, elevated valuation levels and underperformance in the stock price suggest that near-term caution is warranted. As Roku continues improving profitability and executing on its strategy, investors should monitor its progress and consider holding the stock for now.ROKU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Can Netflix Run Continue Despite Tariff Threat?,1746566580000,"The latest tariff news over the weekend had to do with the movie industry. President Trump authorized the Department of Commerce and the USTR to immediately begin the process of instituting 100% tariff on any and all foreign movies coming into the US. While many wondered how exactly that would look given the state of streaming nowadays, it still made a negative impact on Netflix ( NFLX ) Monday morning.The stock gapped down to open the day at $1,114.80, getting as low as $1,107.01. The stock was bid most of the day, closing $10 off its high for the day at $1,134.06. Netflix has been on a tear lately after testing its 200-day, dipping to $821.10 on Monday, April 7th before finding a bid. Earnings helped it along as well.Moving Averages : Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.Support and Resistance Levels : Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.Chart Patterns : He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.Volume Analysis : He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.Dave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Netflix’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:354e85034094b:0-can-netflix-run-continue-despite-tariff-threat/
Netflix’s Trillion-Dollar Baby Ambition: Realistic or Ridiculous?,1745510280000,"Netflix NASDAQ:NFLX , by far the world’s most dominant pure-play streaming stock, just had its eye-popping intentions revealed. A report from the Wall Street Journal says that the company is aiming to grow its market capitalization to $1 trillion by the year 2030 . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:NFLX] Netflix would need to add a whopping $650 billion to its market cap over the next five years to achieve this goal.This would mean adding value around four times the current market cap of one of its largest competitors, the Walt Disney Company NYSE:DIS . This alone demonstrates the monumental task Netflix is undertaking. This analysis will examine what Netflix needs to do to achieve this target , both from a return standpoint and from a business perspective. Can this communications leader realistically attain membership in the $1 trillion club ? This may not be as improbable as it initially sounds.20% Return CAGR or Bust: Netflix’s Journey to $1 TrillionAssuming Netflix aims to achieve this goal by the end of 2030, it would likely need to  massively outperform the market . The S&P 500 Index has averaged around a 10% annual return since 1957. The stock would need to grow from its Apr. 23 closing market cap of about $447 billion to $1 trillion in roughly 4.5 years. That would require a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), or about double the S&P 500’s historical return. That’s close to the 19% CAGR Netflix stock delivered over the past 4.5 years, although returns tend to get harder as a stock grows.However, size is by no means mutually exclusive from large returns. Take Magnificent Seven stocks Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META , and Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG for example. They have achieved return CAGRs of 25%, 23%, and 20% , respectively, over the last five years. An argument certainly exists that once a company achieves a level of size and dominance, it significantly increases its ability to expand its business. Companies of immense size have the ability to make huge bets that can result in massive payoffs. They can also exert their market power to destroy competitors. Overall, simply from a return viewpoint, Netflix’s $1 trillion mission by 2030 is a big hill to climb, but it is far from outside the realm of possibility.Keys to $1 Trillion: Doubling Down on Global Growth and Ad MonetizationOn the business side, Netflix has several key metrics it aims to hit to reach the imposing $1 trillion mark. It wants to add over 100 million new subscribers, growing to 410 million users from the current 302 million. Further expansion into countries like India and Brazil is one path Netflix sees to do this. These added subscribers will go toward doubling total revenues from $39 billion annually in 2024 to $78 billion in 2030. Within this, Netflix wants to grow its advertising sales to $9 billion annually. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:NFLX] Targeting India makes a lot of sense when it comes to growing subscriptions. It is the world’s most populous country, with nearly 1.5 billion people. Netflix already has a decent foothold there, with approximately 12 million subscribers. Experts expect the number of internet users in India to surpass 900 million in 2025. That points to a massive opportunity for Netflix, which remains significantly underpenetrated in the country. Making meaningful gains there could go a long way in helping Netflix reach its subscriber targets.Netflix also has a huge ability to grow its advertising business. Data from eMarketer shows how U.S. adults spend nearly an equal amount of their time online using Netflix as they do on Meta’s apps and YouTube. However, Netflix accounts for less than 1% of total ad spending. Meanwhile, Meta raked in 21% of total ad spending, and YouTube saw over 5%. This highlights that while overall engagement on Netflix is strong , ad monetization remains low, presenting a significant revenue growth opportunity. The company’s new ad-tech stack, Ads Suite, should help drive monetization.Although Netflix’s $1 trillion target may seem daunting when taken at face value, it's not as crazy as it sounds. The company has many ways to drive its stock higher, even outside of the avenues discussed above. When it comes to reaching a $1 trillion market cap, it makes sense not to count Netflix out.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:413912ff2094b:0-netflix-s-trillion-dollar-baby-ambition-realistic-or-ridiculous/
