An Idaho Utility With Growth Potential — Barron's,1748050200000,"Idacorp offers a play on cheap power production and artificial intelligence. Its stock looks like a buy. By Al RootWhen you play Monopoly, you avoid the utilities — they're boring and don't make much money. In the game of life, however, picking up shares of Idacorp, Idaho's regulated electric utility, looks like a winning play.Boise-based Idacorp's principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power, a 109-year-old utility serving some 650,000 retail customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. It generates about two-thirds of the power it delivers to customers, while purchasing the rest. About 20% of the power it generates comes from coal, which the company plans to replace with gas by 2030, while more than half comes from relatively low-cost hydropower, which helps keep costs low for Idahoans. The average price paid by Idacorp customers is less than 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost one-third of what Northeasterners pay for their electricity.Northeastern envy isn't a good reason to buy the stock, though. Growth is. The company sees 8.3% demand growth over the next five years, up from about 1% over the past five. That growth is underpinned by low prices, population inflow, and power-hungry data centers producing cheap electricity for artificial-intelligence computers. Meta Platforms, for instance, is building a data center in Kuna, Idaho, about 20 miles outside of Boise.""It's just about the fastest-growing utility in the country right now,"" says John Bartlett, president and portfolio manager of Reaves Asset Management. The growth rate, expected to be about twice the industry norm, makes the shares look cheap. They trade for about 17 times estimated 2027 earnings and yield 3% — in line with utility averages.The stock hasn't been outperforming, however. Shares are up 6% year to date, about one percentage point behind the Vanguard Utilities exchange-traded fund, which yields a little less than 3%. It didn't help that Idacorp stock traded down about 2% following its May 1 first-quarter earnings report, when the company announced earnings per share of $1.10, seven cents ahead of Wall Street estimates, while reiterating full-year EPS guidance of $5.65 to $5.85. Investors might have been looking for a more substantive update on power rates and capital spending, writes Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell, adding that he thought the quarter was fine.""We view the Idacorp story as one of the strongest in the sub--$10 billion market-cap group,"" says Crowdell, who rates shares Outperform and has a $124 price target for the stock, up about 7% from recent levels.That might not seem like much upside, but it is partly a function of the sector. The median upside for an electric utility stock in the Russell 3000 is about 8% from current levels. Regulated utilities are supposed to be steady Eddies. Few expect them to double over a short period, but returns can be solid. With typical earnings growth for the sector of 6% to 7% and dividend yields of 3%, a 10% total annual return is possible, says Bartlett. Unregulated utilities such as Constellation Energy take more risks on pricing and capacity expansion, hoping to boost asset returns and earnings growth.Idacorp, however, is unusual as a regulated utility with unregulated-like growth. Wall Street projects that earnings will grow close to 8% a year for the coming three years, but Bartlett sees growth better than that as generation capacity expands. It could look more like Constellation's 14% average annual earnings growth. Idacorp stock, however, doesn't trade like Constellation, which fetches 26 times estimated 2026 earnings. Crowdell sees the opportunity for shares to ""rerate"" to a higher price/earnings ratio, but that isn't reflected in his target price.Utilities aren't risk free. Because they're often bought for income, rising long-term bond yields tend to weigh on the sector's valuation multiples, something that's out of Idacorp's control. The group can also suffer ""rate lag"" — when regulators drag out the price increases that enable growth and expansion of capacity. That's something Idacorp can influence. ""Our efforts to reduce regulatory lag [and] provide more timely cost recovery are certainly under way,"" said Tim Tatum, Idacorp's vice president of regulatory affairs, on his company's first-quarter conference call. ""We're hopeful for success in that area."" Idacorp is planning to file a ""rate case"" in late May or early June. A favorable outcome with regulators could give shares a boost later this year.It's necessary, too, as Idacorp invests for growth. Siebert Williams Shank analyst Christopher Ellinghaus expects the company to spend $5.6 billion on new plants and equipment over the coming five years, up from $2.8 billion spent from 2020 to 2024. Higher spending could pressure the balance sheet. The company's net debt is 4.3 times as large as its estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, higher than investors might be used to, but about average for an electric utility.The company is taking steps to make sure its balance sheet doesn't become a problem. Earlier this month, Idacorp raised $575 million in equity capital by selling 5.2 million shares. The sale solidifies the equity financing needed through 2026, says Ellinghaus, who has equity dilution factored into his earnings model. He rates shares Buy and has a $129 price target for the stock, up 11% from recent levels. ""The company has a slew of electricity resource and transmission investments in the hopper,"" he adds, designed to serve ""some of the fastest prospective electricity customer, sales...and rate base growth in the industry.""The risks look manageable, the growth substantial, and the valuation reasonable, making Idacorp stock an undiscovered gem in the Gem State.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522000714:0/
Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Meta's Upside Jumps Nearly 40% as Loop Capital Raises Target,1747929393000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META gained fresh momentum after Loop Capital lifted its price target to $888 from $695, while keeping a Buy rating, according to a Thursday research note.The new forecast implies about 40% upside from current levels, reflecting the firm's confidence in Meta's growth trajectory.Loop Capital highlighted Meta's leading position among non-hardware beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, suggesting the stock may outperform its Magnificent Seven peers this year. Sanderson also pointed to Meta's stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter outlook as a key driver.Earlier concerns that reduced ad spending by China-based retailers would drag on revenue have eased. Meta confirmed in April that some Chinese online merchants cut back ads on Facebook and Instagram amid President Donald Trump's trade policies toward China.

"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H. Cho***Classes and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.Young people are also managing their finances in new ways. Generative artificial intelligence can take on the tedious task of budgeting, and the growing buy-now-pay-later industry grants the power to purchase almost anything in installments.MarketWatch spoke with money experts who offered advice on how to use the latest finance tools responsibly, and to remind graduates not to forget these tried and true personal finance habits.For more on this, read here.- Genna Contino***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert Steiner, Callum Keown This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

$30B AI Opportunity: Will It Power Meta’s Next Surge?,1747864260000,"Magnificent Seven giant Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META has been no stranger to Wall Street analyst upgrades lately. After the company’s last earnings report, nearly 20 analysts tracked by MarketBeat increased their price targets on the stock. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] More recently, analysts at Wolfe Research issued a substantial  price target update on Meta of $750. This implies a significant potential upside in Meta shares of nearly 18% from its May 20 closing price.Mark Zuckerberg recently shared five key AI growth opportunities for the company. This makes an earlier piece of Wolfe's research particularly relevant. Wolfe has referenced the huge growth potential of one opportunity that Zuckerberg mentioned: business messaging. It sees business messaging as a possible $30–$40 billion opportunity for Meta.Zuckerberg's recent comments suggest that business messaging might help Meta hit Wolfe's $750 12-month price target. This analysis will break down Meta’s ambitions in business messaging and show just how powerful they could be for the tech stock.Over a Third of the World Population Is Using WhatsAppAside from Facebook and Instagram, Meta also owns possibly the world’s most-used direct messaging app, WhatsApp . In Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated that WhatsApp has over 3 billion monthly active users . That is equal to around 38% of the world’s population of 8 billion. Zuckerberg also said that more than one billion people use Facebook Messenger every month.Additionally, users send just as many messages on Instagram each day as they do on Messenger. He summed up this massive user count and activity data by saying, “So, Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.""It looks like Meta is gearing up to start aggressively monetizing its huge messaging user base. This could kick off the path toward Meta executing on Wolfe’s massive total addressable market revenue estimates in this space. Wolfe estimates that Meta is only generating around $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue from WhatsApp. That lines up with Meta’s latest earnings. Meta's Other Family of Apps Revenue, which houses WhatsApp, generated around $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. It also generated $510 million in revenue last quarter, growing by 34% from a year ago.Wolfe’s Estimates Indicate a Huge Opportunity for MetaAlthough the timeline around which Wolfe sees Meta achieving $30–$40 billion in business messaging revenue is uncertain, it could clearly be a huge growth driver for Meta. At the midpoints of Wolfe’s estimates , this would mean a 20x increase in Meta’s business messaging revenue . Additionally, $35 billion in business messaging revenue would be equal to over 20% of the $170 billion that Meta generated in the last 12 months. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Meta intends to increase the monetization of business messaging using AI. Zuckerberg envisions every company using an "" AI business agen t."" This agent handles customer service and runs sales campaigns through direct messaging. Meta would then presumably charge companies to do this through its messaging apps.Meta has already seen companies in Thailand and Vietnam using its messaging apps to aid their business. However, they use humans to do so because the cost of labor in those countries is low. The company believes that the use of AI agents can make doing this profitable in developed countries.However, Meta’s focus on monetizing AI in developed countries is somewhat curious. Only around 100 million of WhatsApp’s 3 billion monthly active users are in the United States. Additionally, data shows that most WhatsApp users are in emerging economies. If these economies already have low labor costs, will AI agents really change the adoption of business messaging? While they might not make a difference in whether business messaging is profitable overall in these countries, there is a solid chance they could  raise profitability , thus increasing adoption. This remains to be seen, as Meta is currently testing these AI features. Additionally, an amount of 100 million users is still around 30% of the population in the United States, meaning there is a big opportunity at home as well.With Proper Execution, Business Messaging Could Be Meta’s Next Big HitOverall, Meta’s business messaging ambitions should be a key area of focus for investors going forward. However, it seems reasonable to pump the brakes on Wolfe’s huge forecasts in this area until more tangible results for Meta’s AI agents surface. If successful, business messaging represents a huge possible growth opportunity for one of the most dominant technology names in the world.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:dd1dc9895094b:0-30b-ai-opportunity-will-it-power-meta-s-next-surge/

The outperformance can be attributed to DELL’s expanding portfolio and rich partner base. The company, through its infrastructure solutions, provides essential hardware and services that support cloud environments. DELL is transforming modern data centers with disaggregated infrastructure solutions that integrate storage, cyber resilience, software, and automation.Addressing the evolving demands of on-premises, cloud, and edge environments, DELL empowers organizations to efficiently manage and secure workloads with advanced storage systems like Power Protect Data Domain and PowerScale, enhanced by AI-driven ransomware detection. Its automated Private Cloud and NativeEdge offerings streamline deployment and management, enabling faster provisioning and consistent control across diverse infrastructures. DELL’s comprehensive approach ensures modern data centers are agile, secure, and ready for future challenges.One Month PerformanceDELL’s Expanding Portfolio Aids ProspectDell Technologies’ expanding portfolio has been a key catalyst. The company has added major upgrades to its AI Factory, introducing energy-efficient infrastructure and advanced cooling solutions. These updates aim to simplify and accelerate enterprise AI deployments across edge, data center, and cloud environments.Dell Technologies is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, DELL’s AI-optimized server momentum saw an increase of $1.7 billion in orders. The company shipped $2.1 billion worth of AI servers in the fiscal fourth quarter, and the AI server backlog remained healthy at $4.1 billion.Dell PowerEdge supports the NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell Ultra platform, including the upcoming NVIDIA HGX B300 NVL16, NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition.DELL Benefits From Expanding ClienteleDELL is benefiting from an expanding partner base that includes NVIDIA, Worley, Microsoft, Meta Platforms META, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Imbue. In May 2025, Dell Technologies announced major advancements across the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA to accelerate enterprise AI adoption. These include next-generation PowerEdge servers, enhanced AI data platforms, integrated software solutions, and new managed services for streamlined AI deployment.Dell Technologies collaborated with Meta Platforms to make it easy for its customers to deploy Meta Platforms’ Llama 2 models on-premises with Dell Technologies’ AI-optimized portfolio.In February 2025, Dell Technologies expanded its AI for Telecom program through a collaboration with Advanced Micro Devices to develop AI solutions that enhance real-time telecom network monitoring and management using Dell PowerEdge XE7745 servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices EPYC processors.Dell Technologies Offers Positive Q1 FY26 GuidanceDell Technologies’ innovative portfolio, expanding partner base and growing AI footprint are major growth drivers.

Cautious spending by enterprises and large customers on PCs and storage IT has been a concern for DELL’s investors.Increasing competition in the AI data center market, along with a higher mix of AI-optimized servers, is expected to hurt gross margin expansion in the near term. Additionally, investor sentiment has also soured amid rising trade tension, with additional tariffs raising fears of escalating costs. DELL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Google’s smart glasses bet with Warby Parker could also benefit this other eyewear maker,1747834192000,"Google’s renewed push into the smart glasses market through new partnerships with Warby Parker and luxury fashion group Kering will also benefit EssilorLuxottica- the company behind Ray-Ban smart glasses made with Meta- and accelerate the broad adoption of smart glasses, analysts say. Both Warby Parker and Kering, in separate announcements on Tuesday, said they are working with Google to develop glasses embedded with artificial intelligence, using Android XR, a version of the Android operating system tailored for headsets and glasses.The collaboration with Warby Parker is particularly significant as Google is investing up to $75 million in the company’s product development and commercialization costs.The companies plan to unveil their first product line after 2025, with a series of offerings expected to follow.The two partnerships signal Google’s broader strategy to re-enter a market it helped pioneer, but exited early. Google Glass was once at the forefront of wearable innovation but was eventually shelved due to privacy concerns and tepid consumer interest.Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba described the Google-Warby partnership as a “dream scenario” and predicted rapid expansion of the smart glasses category. “We expect smartglasses growth to be exponential over the next few years, particularly given the product is squarely at the intersection of wearable technology and AI,” he wrote.Deal could accelerate adoption of smart glassesInvestor response to the announcements was swift. Warby Parker shares closed up 16% at $20.34 on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism that the collaboration could mark a turning point for the company’s growth. Shares of Innovative Eyewear, a smaller smart glasses maker, rose 12% to $3.02. Meanwhile, Vuzix, another competitor in the space, fell 3% to $2.46.Jefferies analysts said Google’s partnership with both Warby Parker and Kering to develop artificial intelligence-powered glasses could help accelerate the adoption of smart glasses.They said that Warby Parker is less influential than EssilorLuxottica, the eyewear which with its partner Meta, leads the smartglasses category.“However, seeing established companies work on smart glasses suggests they might become mainstream soon,” they add. Deal validates the success of EssilorLuxottica and Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glassesThe renewed interest in smart glasses comes as demand for AI-integrated wearables appears to be rising. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently reported a surge in demand for Ray-Ban smart glasses, with 2 million units sold by the end of 2024. A new model is expected to launch later this year.Equita Sim analyst Domenico Ghilotti said EssilorLuxottica should benefit from Google’s partnership as the move validates the success of Meta and EssilorLuxottica’s offering and underlines the growing importance of smart eyewear as a channel for deploying consumer AI. “The deal signals the expected reaction of players like Google to the commercial success of Ray-Ban smart glasses, which EssilorLuxottica develops with Meta Platforms,” Ghilotti says. It marks “a confirmation of the growing relevance of this product for the penetration of AI solutions,” the analyst adds.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:b340422be094b:0-google-s-smart-glasses-bet-with-warby-parker-could-also-benefit-this-other-eyewear-maker/

Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/
The AI Diffusion Rule is Over. What That Means for Trump and China. — Barrons.com,1747747020000,"By Justin ShermanAbout the author: Justin Sherman is the founder and CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, a research and advisory firm, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.In a major trade and security pivot, President Donald Trump has scrapped his predecessor's so-called artificial intelligence diffusion rule that was set to be implemented last week. That rule, signed by President Joe Biden in his final days in office, added export controls on integrated circuits and AI models to countries such as China and Iran — with big exemptions for friendly nations such as Germany. Some U.S. AI and chip companies are cheering on this reversal, their present view reflecting that of a Commerce Department spokesperson: Biden's AI rule was ""overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation.""At face value, it seems the leading industry players and the U.S. government are on the same page: Companies want to build and sell chips and AI products globally, and the administration wants U.S. industry to boom. Both worry about Beijing's AI capabilities and threats to U.S. national security. Same talk, same page.But many chip and AI companies' talk about national security and China is more or less just that — talk. For some firms, talking about China and national security is simply a way to frame their own priorities, such as relaxing export controls or building data centers, in terms that land well with the current top policymakers. It seems like talking about Biden's diffusion rule as overly burdensome for companies — and therefore bad for national security — worked.When the rubber meets the road, however, AI and chip companies may not like the Trump administration's hawkish position on China, and the administration may not like companies' true views on national security issues. Whatever replaces the AI diffusion rule will expose those critical tensions.These commercial AI and national security concerns have been brewing under the surface for months. In 2024, many AI companies were trying to present themselves as moving in lockstep with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China. But the Biden administration's domestic work on trustworthy AI certainly caused friction with industry — particularly for those who would rather do away with safeguards. And some began whittling away at the national security narrative.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in July 2024 that closing off U.S. AI systems to China would be a mistake, as America's advantage comes from openness and fewer controls. Framed in the context of helping national security, the anti-regulatory argument spoke to a bigger policy concern: China. OpenAI, shortly thereafter, pitched the administration on a massive data center buildout, likewise framed as key to geopolitical competition. This kind of rhetoric, speaking to fears of ""falling behind"" in what many reductively call the ""AI race,"" also found a receptive audience in Washington. Biden started to put his executive order on data centers in motion.The apparent alignment between the government and commercial chip and AI firms changed with the flick of a pen. When the Biden team published the AI diffusion rule on Jan. 13, the backlash was swift from companies that were, a moment ago, speaking as if they backed the president's national security rationale.Nvidia released a statement that day calling the rule a misguided, unprecedented effort that ""threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide"" and ""squander America's hard-won technological advantage."" The rule is ""cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, "" but ""would do nothing to enhance U.S. security.""That rhetoric evidently worked on the new administration — and the benefits shortly flowed to investors. The day after Trump nixed the diffusion rule, Nvidia's stock rose 4.4%. AMD's stock rose 3.4%. But ditching Biden's order is a temporary resolve between these commercial and national security tensions, likely to be disrupted when the Trump administration rolls out the rule's replacement.A replacement program could relax chip and AI model technology exports to some countries favored by Trump, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and hugely ramp up limits for China. That will prompt industry concerns for chip companies wanting to sell in China and to maintain certain China-based supply chain points. Or a new program could soften restrictions below a certain compute or model performance threshold, but broadly curb exports of higher-end technologies in ways that impact a different vertical of industry sales.As a general rule, export restrictions focused on national security are going to both limit companies' overseas market opportunities and speak to issues that aren't companies' bread and butter. Just as some investment firms are skeptical of inbound and outbound investment screening, some leading chip and AI companies are unlikely to truly buy into the scope and degree of national security concerns about exports to China.So administration officials — particularly those most hawkish on Beijing — may find themselves in direct confrontation with chip and AI companies that are keen on continuing to sell high-end chips to Chinese buyers. The administration's concerns about AI diffusion to China through third countries may also conflict with companies that feel even countries with close ties to China aren't in fact China — and therefore aren't a risk. Officials could even encounter the same amount of pushback and criticism on a more relaxed export rule than the Biden administration faced on its more sweeping one. After all, the psychological treadmill kicks in, and even a more moderate set of rules will still raise the regulatory floor — and demand higher compliance costs and impact bottom lines.This isn't to say every chip and AI company is crying ""national security"" just to get on policymakers' calendars. Plenty of chip and AI companies build tech entirely or primarily for national security use cases. Some major AI vendors, such as Anthropic, supported the AI diffusion rule with tweaks. Last month, Anthropic said stronger export controls on chips were necessary to keep a competitive lead over China.It is healthy for commercial enterprises to have a range of views on geopolitical and national security issues, especially in a volatile global trade and geopolitical environment.But as the administration talks genuinely about the country's AI advantage over China, these tensions under the surface will bubble up again. Companies will have to navigate more uncertainty and new national security guidelines. And policymakers may have to confront public-private differences of opinion on China head-on.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Bull of the Day: TaskUs (TASK),1747728000000,"Providing outsourced digital services, TaskUs TASK is an up-and-coming tech company that investors should consider right now.Most appealing, TaskUs stock is trading under $20 a share, and the company’s diversification makes it a very appealing investment as it relates to the rapid expansion of the outsourced digital services market.TaskUs serves the crypto, social media, e-commerce, gaming, food delivery, and ride sharing industries, among others, with some of its most notable clients being Coinbase COIN, Meta Platforms META, DoorDash DASH, and Uber UBER.Outsourced Digital Services OverviewAs a brief overview, outsourced digital services refer to the practice of hiring external experts or companies to manage and implement digital products or services most commonly including IT support and cloud computing, software development, digital marketing, customer service, and data analytics. As for TaskUs, its digital outsourcing specialties include AI-powered customer support and content moderation. Furthermore, in the grand scheme of things, the global IT services outsourcing market was valued at over $700 billion in 2024 and is expected to be worth upwards of $1 trillion by 2030, with a projected CAGR of more than 8% during this period. This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic showed the prolific need for digital content in particular, leading to increased demand for outsourcing these specific services. Image Source: Grand View ResearchTaskUs Accelerates Agentic AI Services Going back to its diversity and expansion, TaskUs recently announced a strategic partnership with AI-driven customer support companies Decagon and Regal last Tuesday. The partnerships augment TaskUs' agentic AI consulting practice, a set of business services and expertise that help companies seamlessly integrate advanced AI technologies into their customer experience operations.To that point, agentic AI can accomplish complex tasks autonomously with minimal human interaction, unlike traditional AI models, as it builds on the rapid progress of generative AI by exhibiting goal-driven behavior, adaptability, and reasoning to solve problems dynamically.TaskUs Growth Trajectory Based on Zacks' estimates, TaskUs’ total sales are expected to rise 13% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to increase another 12% in FY26 to $1.26 billion. Plus, annual earnings are expected to be up 7% this year and are projected to spike another 14% in FY26 to $1.57 per share.It’s also noteworthy that FY26 sales projections would represent 163% growth from sales of $478 million during the height of the pandemic in 2020, with TaskUs going public in June of 2021.TaskUs’ Attractive Valuation While many tech stocks with attractive growth potential (especially as it relates to AI) can usually trade at a stretched premium to the broader market, TASK shares are trading at a very reasonable 12X forward earnings multiple. In comparison, TaskUs’ Zacks Computers-IT Services Industry average is at 21.6X forward earnings, with the benchmark S&P 500’s average currently at 22.9X. Notably, TaskUs also trades at less than 2X sales, which can be a rarity for expansive tech companies even in their later stages of corporate life. Bottom Line Considering its concentration on agentic AI, now appears to be an ideal time to buy TaskUs stock with TASK having an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum. More intriguing, TASK has rebounded and soared over +40% in the last two years but still offers a nearly 30% discount from its IPO price of $23.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:624c6f8da094b:0-bull-of-the-day-taskus-task/

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year.

More Young People are Using Gen AI to Plan Trips — Market Talk,1747672500000,"Even as more users look to ChatGPT, Meta AI and Google's Gemini to research products and shop, relatively few are using the platforms to plan trips, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. Younger cohorts, though, are increasingly turning to the applications for travel planning, with such usage growing at a faster clip than for their older peers in the last six months, the analysts said. Product innovation and improved commercial capabilities, like a Google digital travel agent or similar offering, will likely dictate the pace of adoption from here on out, the analysts say.

META: Meta Stock Can’t Rebound for Days After News Native ‘Behemoth’ AI Model Is Delayed,1747641865000,"Is Zuckerberg in trouble or is that another opportunity to buy the dip in big tech? According to WSJ, Meta’s engineers can’t come up with anything impressive for the launch of Behemoth. 📢 Meta Stock Can’t Catch a Break- Meta stock NASDAQ:META can’t shake off the selling pressure after it was slammed by investors on Thursday when a bad report came out. A Wall Street Journal story revealed internal struggles over the company’s flagship “Behemoth” AI model. - Shares of Meta dropped 0.6% on Friday, extending their Thursday loss of 2.4% when the news broke out. - Touted as the company’s jewel of Meta’s AI crown, the “Behemoth” project is now getting delayed. An April release got pushed back to May and the May release is now pushed back to fall or later. 🔥 Internal Troubles Loom- Engineers at the big tech giants, the WSJ said, can’t figure out how to make the model better so they’ve decided it’s not worthy of a push live just yet. What’s worse, and maybe more concerning, is that 11 of the 14 researchers who built the OG Llama model have bailed and are no longer with the Facebook owner. - Meta’s AI initiatives have been supporting the stock’s upside swing for months (if not a couple years already). In its latest earnings report, Zuckerberg’s tech titan raised its capital expenditures (capex) for 2025 to $72 billion from $60 billion , focusing the lion’s share of that pile of cash on AI gigs. 🔑 Meta’s Stock Performance- While the stock has been in a mild selloff mode, some money spinners have switched on their buy-the-dip mode. Loop Capital, for one, slapped a bullish price target on Meta stock Friday, predicting a 40% upside to $888 per share from the current $640 a pop. - Year to date, Meta stock has been doing much like the rest of the Magnificent Seven club — not too great. Shares of the company just recently turned positive, boasting a roughly 7% increase since trading kicked off for 2025.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:8e7c40fdd094b:0-meta-meta-stock-can-t-rebound-for-days-after-news-native-behemoth-ai-model-is-delayed/

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/
Senate Is Set to Pass a Stablecoin Bill. Rules for Crypto Exchanges Will Be Harder. — Barrons.com,1747433880000,"By Joe LightThe crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.As soon as Monday, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets like Treasury bills. Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and to give coin holders priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy.Stablecoins underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Rather than pay cash for a token, traders typically use stablecoins, which together have a market value of about $250 billion. The largest such token, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global.While stablecoins are currently used primarily for trading, issuers believe they could soon be a serious challenger to traditional payments networks. Their expectation is that they could also save consumers billions of dollars in fees on remittances and other expensive cross-border transactions.The bill requires 60 votes to move through the Senate, and earlier this month, it appeared the GENIUS Act would sail through with bipartisan support. Even though some Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), have been skeptical of the crypto industry push, many other lawmakers have warmed to the industry. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions and lobbying.The bill's recent troubles have hinged on two major issues. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. A second issue is President Donald Trump's business arrangements with the industry.A revised draft of the bill appears to throw up a roadblock to tech companies issuing stablecoins by requiring nonfinancial public companies to get special approval from a committee. However, the new bill doesn't address concerns that Trump and his family could directly profit from the tokens through its majority ownership of crypto firm World Liberty Financial, which has issued a stablecoin called USD1.A memo, titled ""Negotiations Win Summary,"" circulated among Democratic senators earlier this week, touting ""major victories"" won since early May, including the new Big Tech language. However, it remains to be seen whether the changes will be enough to ensure passage. The bill is expected to have an easier time in the House of Representatives, which won't require a supermajority for approval.A bigger problem for the crypto industry is what the stablecoin bill's troubles could mean for a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and the thousands of issuers of crypto tokens. During former President Joe Biden's administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase — as well as other exchanges and token issuers — for allegedly violating securities laws, charges that Coinbase denied.Trump's SEC promptly dismissed those cases with prejudice, meaning the same cases can't be brought back later. But there is a fear that a future administration could come back with similar allegations if a new law governing crypto market structure doesn't make clear what does and doesn't fall under the SEC's remit.""After this, getting market structure is even more important,"" said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on a conference panel this week with Gillibrand and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.).How to police crypto exchanges and issuers is a more controversial issue than stablecoins, even within the industry itself. Among the issues are how to decide when a token is sufficiently ""decentralized"" for it not to be subject to securities laws.Apart from the stablecoin venture, Trump or his family own or have ties to a Bitcoin mining firm, several ""meme"" coins and so-called nonfungible tokens, and a venture to launch crypto exchange-traded funds, giving many more reasons for Democrats to blanch at the swift passage of a comprehensive crypto bill.It took several near-death experiences for lawmakers potentially to squeak through stablecoin legislation. That might prove to have been the easy part.Write to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Meta's 5 Key Pillars for AI Growth—Zuckerberg's Bold Vision,1747420380000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] In its last earnings call, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META made a concerted effort to add more transparency around its AI strategy .Mark Zuckerberg laid out the “ five major opportunities ” the company is pursuing through its AI investments. Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C called this out as a significant positive .Understanding these opportunities is crucial to assessing whether the tech giant is living up to expectations going forward.How effectively Meta capitalizes on them will likely influence both investor confidence and the company’s long-term growth trajectory.Opportunities for the Here and Now: Advertising & App ExperiencesThe first opportunity is “ improved advertising ."" This is what Meta has already been doing and generating its great financial results from. The company essentially wants to make it as easy as possible for businesses to get customers.Meta’s technology is learning how to show the right ad to the right person at the right time . As it gets better, advertisers are paying more money per ad , demonstrating the value they are receiving. The company’s AI ad creation tools also saw 30% more usage last quarter. This shows that the tools are likely making it easier for marketers to create ads.The second opportunity is “more engaging experiences."" Essentially, Meta wants to increase the amount of time spent and the level of interaction with content on its apps. This would raise the value of advertising on Meta as users focus more on its apps than on other platforms. The company shares that  improvements to its content recommendation systems have led to a 6% to 35% increase in time spent on its various apps.Facebook started as a place where people shared mostly through written posts. However, image—and video-based content are far more engaging. Zuckerberg sees content progressing even further. People and the content they are watching will interact back and forth with each other in real time. He believes AI will be key in enabling the creation of this type of content. Seeing tangible examples of creators producing this type of content and successfully increasing engagement will be vital.Emerging Opportunities: Messaging Monetization, Meta AI, AI GlassesThe next opportunity is “business messaging.""   Billions of users and messages are sent across Meta’s WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram apps. However, messaging on these platforms is largely unmonetized at this point. Zuckerberg sees a future where companies generate sales through direct messaging customers. Companies in Thailand and Vietnam already do this extensively.However, they use human employees because the labor cost in these countries is low. Companies can use AI agents to message people to make this profitable in developed countries. This could create a large monetization opportunity for Meta. Continued user growth is important as investors await more details on this front. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] The fourth opportunity is Meta AI . This AI assistant was built into Meta’s apps and is now available as a standalone app . Meta AI now has almost 1 billion monthly active users. Ultimately, Zuckerberg wants to increase engagement as people talk to Meta AI and discover more content that interests them.This can lead to opportunities to show personalized product recommendations . He also anticipates a premium service , presumably some type of subscription. He says it will continue growing the platform for at least a year before thinking about revenue generation. As with business messaging, increased users and engagement will be important to see going forward.The final opportunity Zuckerberg outlined was “AI devices."" Specifically, he mentioned that glasses are the “ideal form factor” for AI and the metaverse. Zuckerberg believes that over the next five to ten years, many of the more than 1 billion people who wear glasses today will switch to AI glasses.He mentioned that sales of the company’s Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses tripled in the past year. It will be important to pay attention to seeing sales grow in this area and to see significant improvements in the technology.What This All Means for InvestorsNow that Meta has laid out this  AI framework , evaluating the company’s performance becomes easier.Investors should stay keenly aware of different metrics and commentary that indicate how well Meta is performing in each of these areas. When it comes to the emerging opportunities, investors also shouldn’t panic if results stagnate.Zuckerberg notes that the company does not need to succeed in all these areas to succeed overall. Zuckerberg gave markets a  clear score sheet to judge the company's performance with. Now, it's up to Meta to execute.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:a7e411511094b:0-meta-s-5-key-pillars-for-ai-growth-zuckerberg-s-bold-vision/
The Next Generation of AI Remains Elusive. All That CapEx Has Yet to Pay Off. — Barrons.com,1747414500000,"By Adam LevineOn Thursday The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platform's largest and most ambitious AI language model, Llama 4 Behemoth, would be delayed for the second time. Meta stock fell on the news, finishing Thursday down 2.4%.In delaying its next generation of language models, Meta has good company in AI start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic.OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 came out in November 2022 and shocked the world with its capabilities; it was the spark that set the AI world ablaze. Just a few months later, it released the much larger GPT-4, a big leap in capabilities.Observers projected this rate of progress into the future, leading to bold predictions of superintelligent computers within just a few years.But it's been two years since GPT-4's release, and GPT-5 is nowhere to be found. Anthropic announced a new Claude model, Opus, last June. It, too, isn't ready.Meta's Behemoth is set to be by far the largest AI model Meta has produced, and it looks like it is running into the same walls that OpenAI and Anthropic hit. The report from the Wall Street Journal said that Meta staffers were questioning ""whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release.""A Meta spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The company didn't respond to a request for comment from Barron's.With new large-language models bumping into technical roadblocks, the AI model makers have had to find other ways to make their chatbots perform better. New ""reasoning"" models, like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek r1, have long internal dialogues with themselves and work through problems step-by-step, checking itself as it goes along. They work well, but they're very slow.For example, Barron's asked OpenAI o3, ""Explain how much Meta is spending on AI data centers, and how much their pre-training runs for Llama 4 Behemoth cost."" o3 spent over four minutes talking to itself before spitting about a thousand-word answer. Meanwhile, all that ""thinking"" costs money; for developers, o3 is five times more expensive than OpenAI's best non-reasoning model.New, larger models offer the hope of an o3-type response, without four minutes of thinking.The disappointment from Meta investors on Thursday is compounded by the massive amounts of money the company is spending to make a new model happen. After spending $14 billion in capital expenditures in the first quarter, Meta projected it would spend another $50 billion to $58 billion on AI data centers in the remaining nine months of 2025. Training runs to create these very large models are expensive; Meta's research and development costs for the first quarter were up by 22% from the year before.Investors are still wondering when the payoff for all this investment comes. Advertising is the likely path for Meta to monetize AI, given that 98% of its total 2024 revenue came from advertising.But it's not on the near horizon. ""Our initial focus for Meta AI is really about building a great consumer experience, and that's frankly where all of our energies are kind of directed to right now,"" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Meta's fourth quarter earnings call. ""There will, I think, be pretty clear monetization opportunities here over time.""More recently, CEO Mark Zuckerberg sounded optimistic about Meta's return on investment when it comes to AI spending. After laying out a range of monetization possibilities, he said, ""We don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.""Shares of Meta were down 1.4% in mid-day trading on Friday.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?,1747413720000,"Income-hungry investors have been piling into ETFs that use options to deliver juicy dividends. We've seen a surge in launches of these products recently, as providers employ innovative strategies to package derivatives within the ETF structure to meet rising investor demand.In addition to offering high yields, these strategies generally help reduce portfolio volatility. However, investors should remember that there’s no free lunch in investing. These products tend to perform best in sideways markets and often underperform during strong bull runs. That said, they can provide some downside protection when stocks fall.Quantitative Researcher Roni Israelov refers to these strategies as a “Devil’s Bargain.” His research shows that trading options to generate income can undermine long-term investment returns.This paper is Roni’s personal research and not a work product of Citadel.Our own analysis of the most popular derivatives-backed ETFs also suggests that investors may be leaving significant returns on the table in their pursuit of high income. Nevertheless, these products have attracted substantial inflows this year, as market volatility has shaken investor confidence.The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses proprietary research to select around 130 stocks and writes S&P 500 Index call options to generate income. Its top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META.JEPI and its sister fund, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, are among the top asset gatherers this year.The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO aims to deliver high income from both dividends and covered calls. Its managers focus on high-quality large-cap companies with a history of dividend growth and write covered calls on individual stocks.While DIVO has outperformed JEPI, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term on a total return basis.JEPQ and the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD continue to underperform the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d14073830094b:0-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-options-income-etfs/

Meta plans to invest $72 billion in capital expenditure this year. While the analyst noted that current core AI investments are constrained by capacity, new data centre AI capacity is coming online. A behemoth concernThis positive note comes after a Wall Street Journal report said that Meta is delaying the rollout of its “Behemoth” large language model. The Behemoth model was first slated to come out in April 2025 but was later pushed to June and now to fall or later, the report said. According to the report, Meta’s engineers were concerned that Behemoth’s performance couldn’t match what the company’s public statements. Meta had touted that Behemoth outperformed similar AI models of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic in some tests. After the report came, Meta’s stock fell over 2% on Thursday. FTC monopoly caseMeta recently asked a federal judge to drop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) case against the company. The company argued that the FTC failed to prove the antitrust case. FTC had accused Meta of dominating the social media market by buying out rival companies such as Instagram and WhatsApp to buy out the competition.The trial started in April, and the FTC is trying to show Meta was trying to buy out the competition a decade ago by pointing out emails of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg worrying about Instagram and WhatsApp’s growth. If the judge doesn’t drop the case, the trial may run into June as Meta is now presenting its own evidence against the charges. Meta stock continues to shineMeta stock has gained over 7% in the year so far, emerging as the second-best-performing stock among the magnificent seven cohort of stocks in that period. Microsoft is the best performing stock with a 8% gain and Apple has been the worst performing among the group with a 13% decline. Meta’s shares had gained over 28% in the last month as investors cheered strong Q1 results. The company had posted a 16% increase in revenue to $42.31 billion against an expected $41.40 billion. Its net income surged 35% to $16.64 billion.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:9ce1d334c094b:0-why-this-investment-bank-sees-more-than-30-upside-on-meta/
AppLovin and Boise Cascade have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1747398960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares AppLovin Corp. APP as the Bull of the Day and Boise Cascade BCC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AppLovin Corp. APP, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:AppLovin Corp. is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level.AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more.Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth.The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26.Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices.APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s 360% and Meta’s 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.Bear of the Day:Boise Cascade is one of the top North American producers of engineered wood products and plywood. BCC stock has tanked over 20% in 2025, driven by macroeconomic challenges, industry-specific headwinds, and operational pressures.The engineered wood products powerhouse missed our Q1 2025 earnings estimate by 22% on May 5. It also offered disappointing guidance as part of Boise Cascade’s extended trend of downward EPS revisions.What’s Going On with BCC Stock?Boise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022, before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and a slowing housing market.The company’s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively.Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted earnings dropped 59% YoY in the first quarter to $1.06 a share, missing our estimate by 22%. CEO Nate Jorgensen pointed to “constrained demand, difficult weather, and planned downtime at our Oakdale veneer and plywood mill” as part of its rough quarter and downbeat outlook.Boise Cascade's consensus 2025 earnings estimate has dropped 18% since its Q1 report. Its 2026 estimate has slipped 13% since then, and its overall negative earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company’s earnings are projected to fall another 31% YoY in 2025 on 2% lower sales.Stay Away from Boise Cascade Stock for Now?Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. The company also pays dividends and has a sturdy balance sheet.Investors might want to put Boise Cascade on their watchlists since it could be a longer-term winner. Unfortunately, BCC faces near-term headwinds driven by weak housing market demand, economic uncertainty, and more.Additional content:AppLovin Stock Plunges -26% in 3 Months: Is It a Buy Now?AppLovin Corp. has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry’s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP’s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin’s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand.Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP’s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the previous years.APP Is a BuyAPP presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its impressive financial performance and robust growth prospects. The company's recent results and strategic initiatives underscore its potential for continued success in the gaming and software sectors. AppLovin’s strong fundamentals, innovative technology and strategic growth initiatives position it as a leader in its industry. With a solid financial outlook and increasing analyst confidence, we recommend a ""Buy"" rating for APP stock to capitalize on its promising growth trajectory.APP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Market Chatter: Meta Faces Growing Scrutiny Over Surge in Online Scams,1747395744000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META is struggling to curb widespread fraud across Facebook and Instagram, including fake ads and marketplace scams, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing internal documents and regulators. Banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and global watchdogs have reportedly flagged Meta's role in a rising number of financial scams, with some banks reporting that nearly half of Zelle scam reports originated on its platforms. Despite repeated internal warnings and mounting losses to users, Meta has been slow to implement stricter ad verification and often permits known scammers to run dozens of fraudulent ads before enforcement, the WSJ reported. Meta's online Marketplace and ad system have reportedly become key tools for international criminal networks using tactics like impersonation and fraudulent giveaways to trick users, the news outlet added.

Meta Seeks Dismissal of FTC Case Alleging Illegal Social Media Monopoly,1747392911000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META on Thursday filed a motion asking a federal judge to dismiss a case by the Federal Trade Commission accusing the social media giant of holding an illegal monopoly in social media. The FTC has sought to show that Meta illegally dominated the market for social media platforms used to share updates with friends and family via its WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions, Reuters reported. ""Recent data decisively refutes the claim that 'friends-and-family sharing' insulates Meta's apps from competition from (among many others) YouTube, iMessage, and, most dramatically, TikTok — a disruptive entrant that forced Meta to transform Facebook and Instagram or risk precipitous decline,"" Meta said in a Thursday court filing.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:META vs. MSFT: Which AI Superpower Is a Better Buy?Meta Platforms and Microsoft have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies.Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents.

Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month.Microsoft is now extending Copilot’s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft.

Meta's Key AI Model Hit by Delay. What It Means for the Stock. — Barrons.com,1747386840000,"By Callum KeownMeta Platforms stock held steady early Friday after falling late in the previous session following a report that the Facebook parent is delaying the rollout of its new artificial intelligence model.The release of Meta's Behemoth large-language model was initially internally slated for April before it was pushed to June, but now the target has been delayed to the fall or later, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.The shares fell 2.4% Thursday and were flat in premarket trading Friday. The stock looks to be stabilizing following the losses, suggesting the delay may not have a huge impact on the price. Meta remains 10% higher in 2025 through Thursday's close — the best performer in the Magnificent Seven group.Engineers are struggling to improve the model's capabilities, leading to questions from staff over whether Behemoth has enough improvements over previous versions to justify a public release, the report added.The tech giant, like its peers, is spending billions of dollars on developing AI offerings. Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion at the end of last month, up from between $60 billion and $65 billion.Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.Separately, Meta asked a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's case alleging it run an illegal social media monopoly Thursday, Reuters reported. The antitrust trial, relating to Meta's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, began last month.Write to Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Bull of the Day: AppLovin Corporation (APP),1747382400000,"AppLovin Corporation APP   is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level. AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more. Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth. The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26. Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices. APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s NVDA 360% and Meta’s META 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:884240936094b:0-bull-of-the-day-applovin-corporation-app/
An Idaho Utility With Growth Potential — Barron's,1748050200000,"Idacorp offers a play on cheap power production and artificial intelligence. Its stock looks like a buy. By Al RootWhen you play Monopoly, you avoid the utilities — they're boring and don't make much money. In the game of life, however, picking up shares of Idacorp, Idaho's regulated electric utility, looks like a winning play.Boise-based Idacorp's principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power, a 109-year-old utility serving some 650,000 retail customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. It generates about two-thirds of the power it delivers to customers, while purchasing the rest. About 20% of the power it generates comes from coal, which the company plans to replace with gas by 2030, while more than half comes from relatively low-cost hydropower, which helps keep costs low for Idahoans. The average price paid by Idacorp customers is less than 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost one-third of what Northeasterners pay for their electricity.Northeastern envy isn't a good reason to buy the stock, though. Growth is. The company sees 8.3% demand growth over the next five years, up from about 1% over the past five. That growth is underpinned by low prices, population inflow, and power-hungry data centers producing cheap electricity for artificial-intelligence computers. Meta Platforms, for instance, is building a data center in Kuna, Idaho, about 20 miles outside of Boise.""It's just about the fastest-growing utility in the country right now,"" says John Bartlett, president and portfolio manager of Reaves Asset Management. The growth rate, expected to be about twice the industry norm, makes the shares look cheap. They trade for about 17 times estimated 2027 earnings and yield 3% — in line with utility averages.The stock hasn't been outperforming, however. Shares are up 6% year to date, about one percentage point behind the Vanguard Utilities exchange-traded fund, which yields a little less than 3%. It didn't help that Idacorp stock traded down about 2% following its May 1 first-quarter earnings report, when the company announced earnings per share of $1.10, seven cents ahead of Wall Street estimates, while reiterating full-year EPS guidance of $5.65 to $5.85. Investors might have been looking for a more substantive update on power rates and capital spending, writes Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell, adding that he thought the quarter was fine.""We view the Idacorp story as one of the strongest in the sub--$10 billion market-cap group,"" says Crowdell, who rates shares Outperform and has a $124 price target for the stock, up about 7% from recent levels.That might not seem like much upside, but it is partly a function of the sector. The median upside for an electric utility stock in the Russell 3000 is about 8% from current levels. Regulated utilities are supposed to be steady Eddies. Few expect them to double over a short period, but returns can be solid. With typical earnings growth for the sector of 6% to 7% and dividend yields of 3%, a 10% total annual return is possible, says Bartlett. Unregulated utilities such as Constellation Energy take more risks on pricing and capacity expansion, hoping to boost asset returns and earnings growth.Idacorp, however, is unusual as a regulated utility with unregulated-like growth. Wall Street projects that earnings will grow close to 8% a year for the coming three years, but Bartlett sees growth better than that as generation capacity expands. It could look more like Constellation's 14% average annual earnings growth. Idacorp stock, however, doesn't trade like Constellation, which fetches 26 times estimated 2026 earnings. Crowdell sees the opportunity for shares to ""rerate"" to a higher price/earnings ratio, but that isn't reflected in his target price.Utilities aren't risk free. Because they're often bought for income, rising long-term bond yields tend to weigh on the sector's valuation multiples, something that's out of Idacorp's control. The group can also suffer ""rate lag"" — when regulators drag out the price increases that enable growth and expansion of capacity. That's something Idacorp can influence. ""Our efforts to reduce regulatory lag [and] provide more timely cost recovery are certainly under way,"" said Tim Tatum, Idacorp's vice president of regulatory affairs, on his company's first-quarter conference call. ""We're hopeful for success in that area."" Idacorp is planning to file a ""rate case"" in late May or early June. A favorable outcome with regulators could give shares a boost later this year.It's necessary, too, as Idacorp invests for growth. Siebert Williams Shank analyst Christopher Ellinghaus expects the company to spend $5.6 billion on new plants and equipment over the coming five years, up from $2.8 billion spent from 2020 to 2024. Higher spending could pressure the balance sheet. The company's net debt is 4.3 times as large as its estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, higher than investors might be used to, but about average for an electric utility.The company is taking steps to make sure its balance sheet doesn't become a problem. Earlier this month, Idacorp raised $575 million in equity capital by selling 5.2 million shares. The sale solidifies the equity financing needed through 2026, says Ellinghaus, who has equity dilution factored into his earnings model. He rates shares Buy and has a $129 price target for the stock, up 11% from recent levels. ""The company has a slew of electricity resource and transmission investments in the hopper,"" he adds, designed to serve ""some of the fastest prospective electricity customer, sales...and rate base growth in the industry.""The risks look manageable, the growth substantial, and the valuation reasonable, making Idacorp stock an undiscovered gem in the Gem State.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522000714:0/
Meta Battles an 'Epidemic of Scams' as Criminals Flood Instagram and Facebook — WSJ,1747357200000,"By Jeff Horwitz and Angel Au-YeungFor almost two years, Edgar Guzman has been getting calls from irate customers who responded to his ads on Instagram and Facebook. Or at least they thought they were his ads.Guzman's company, called ""Half-Off Wholesale,"" offers home-improvement supplies and garden equipment in bulk out of a suburban Atlanta warehouse. The ads offer steep discounts that are mouthwatering to bargain hunters: $29 for a pallet of power tools, and mixed boxes of returned Amazon.com merchandise with a starting bid of just $1, for example.But when people send their payments, the products never arrive. When they call Guzman to complain, he has to deliver the bad news: They've been swindled.""What sucks is we have to break it to people that they've been scammed — we don't even do online sales,"" he said, noting that customer complaints about the rip-offs generate bad online reviews for his real business. ""We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.""Guzman's experience is not unusual.Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is increasingly a cornerstone of the internet fraud economy, according to regulators, banks and internal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The company accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a person familiar with the service. The peer-to-peer payment platform is owned by several banking giants, including JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank, and Wells Fargo. Other banks that offer Zelle have experienced similarly high fraud claims originating on Meta, according to people familiar with the matter.British and Australian regulators have found similar levels of fraud originating on Meta's platforms. An internal analysis from 2022 described in company documents likewise found that 70% of newly active advertisers on the platform are promoting scams, illicit goods or ""low quality"" products.In Guzman's case, a search of Meta's ad library this spring showed that more than 4,400 different ads listing the address of his business have run on Meta's platforms over the last year. Guzman's actual business was responsible for 15 of them.Account information for the scam pages shows they are run out of China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and the Philippines, but they use stolen pictures of Half-Off's warehouse and list its address.With more than 3 billion daily users on Meta's platforms, fraud is hardly a new phenomenon for the company. But fed by the rise of cryptocurrencies, generative AI and vast overseas crime networks based out of Southeast Asia, the immensity of Meta's scam problem is growing and has been regularly flagged by employees over the past several years.Current and former employees say Meta is reluctant to add impediments for ad-buying clients who drove a 22% increase in its advertising business last year to over $160 billion. Even after users demonstrate a history of scamming, Meta balks at removing them.One late 2024 document reviewed by the Journal shows that the company will allow advertisers to accrue between eight and 32 automated ""strikes"" for financial fraud before it bans their accounts. In instances where Meta employees personally escalate the problem, the limit can drop to between four and 16 strikes.Adding to the problem is Marketplace, its online secondhand-market that in less than a decade since its launch has surpassed Craigslist to become the internet's most heavily used repository of free classified ads. Its peer-to-peer model has also made Marketplace a popular hunting ground for scammers.A Meta spokesman said that the company is working to address ""an epidemic of scams"" that has grown in scale and complexity in recent years, driven by cross-border criminal networks.""As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts,"" he said. He added that Meta is testing the use of facial-recognition technology, adding warnings to users on its platforms and building partnerships with banks and tech companies ""since this crime affects many industries and cuts across different parts of society.""Meta has also argued in U.S. federal court that it bears no legal responsibility to address the issue.""The alleged underenforcement of Meta's monitoring policies cannot give rise to liability,"" the company wrote last year in a motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging negligence in removing cryptocurrency impersonation scams, adding that it ""does not owe a duty to users"" to address fraud on its platforms.The spokesman said the company nonetheless makes efforts to do so.""We of course don't want scammy activity on our platform and nothing about this statement — a nuanced legal argument — should be read to suggest otherwise,"" he said.Fake giveawaysMeta chief Mark Zuckerberg's recent move to scale back fact checking and policing of hate speech and other problem content has infuriated some and pleased others. But his company's ongoing ineffectiveness at governing fraud on its platforms has drawn less scrutiny — even though it causes widespread and tangible problems for consumers and businesses.Meta's lax approach has helped fuel the professionalization of social-media fraud by international criminal networks in Southeast Asia, says Erin West, a recently retired Santa Clara County prosecutor who helped author a U.S. Institute for Peace report last year on such activity.The report estimated organized scamming operations — often called ""pig butchering"" groups — comprise hundreds of thousands of people, many trafficked after falling for fraudulent social-media employment ads. Kept in prisonlike compounds, the workers are forced to work under threat of ""extreme forms of torture and abuse.""West said the growth of this nightmarish industry stems directly from the inaction of Meta and, to a lesser extent, its social-media peers.""If there's anybody who could make a huge dent here, it's Meta,"" she said. ""But there's no hammer over their head.""Losses to scams on Meta can range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but there's seemingly no target too small.Some of the frauds reflect substantial complexity and effort. In recent months, accounts featuring grandmotherly photos have been running Facebook and Instagram ads for a supposed giveaway of a McCormick & Co. spice rack and a selection of its products. Users are asked to provide only a nominal $9.99 shipping fee via a website featuring McCormick branding, a user survey and a game to win prizes.Marah Johnson of Orange County, Calif., has regularly encountered and reported scams on Facebook for years. But she fell for this one. After she entered her credit card information on the McCormick-branded website, she was billed for a series of fraudulent purchases totaling hundreds of dollars.""If their revenue is coming from fraud, what is their incentive to protect people?"" asked Johnson, a 58-year-old artist and jewelry-maker. ""It feels like Meta is helping the scammers out.""The scam is sufficiently widespread that McCormick Brands warned its 2 million followers on Facebook and Instagram of it on Jan. 31, eliciting hundreds of comments from users who said they'd been scammed.""I feel so stupid,"" wrote one.""I got hit for $70 I can't afford,"" responded another.""Why can't Facebook police these scammers?"" asked a third.A McCormick spokesperson declined to comment.Puppies for saleOne of the most common scams seen by banks involves the sale of pets, despite Meta's rules banning ""peer-to-peer sales or trade"" of live animals outside of narrow contexts.A recent search for ""puppies"" over several days yielded thousands of ads, most stating no affiliation with a known dog breeder or rescue organization as Meta's rules require.Other red flags abounded. Many of the results displayed common hallmarks of scams, including stolen photos of specific pets and ads from sellers supposedly ""near me"" who were actually operating out of Cameroon.JPMorgan has repeatedly raised concerns with Meta about its policing of scams, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person said the volume of scams attributable to Meta has shown some improvement in recent months.During that period both Meta and Zelle began issuing warnings to their respective users about scam risks arising from peer-to-peer payments.Documents reviewed by the Journal show that Meta has deprioritized scam enforcement in recent years, emphasizing the avoidance of erroneous ad takedowns over safety concerns. The company has also been cutting costs and shifting resources to other issues in the reshuffling.The company abandoned plans for advertiser verification requirements similar to what it mandates for political ads, people familiar with the matter say, on the grounds that it worried about losing revenue from marketers unwilling or unable to pass identity checks.Meta has periodically declared ""site events"" — company slang for internal emergencies of varying severity — for spikes in scams. But the company has generally treated scams as what documents describe as a ""low severity"" user experience issue rather than a significant threat to vulnerable people or vector for organized international crime.One 2022 document described ""a lack of investment"" in building automated tools to identify scams. The work's low priority within Meta was codified in an update that year of its content moderation processes that put more resources into addressing human trafficking and content promoting suicide and self-harm, and less on anti-scam measures.A mid-2022 analysis of the reprioritization found that it resulted in a 46% drop in likely scams reviewed within Facebook Groups.The Meta spokesman said that the documents seen by the Journal are old and that the company has been ramping up its investments in anti-scam work since the second half of 2022. He said it took down more than 2 million accounts linked to organized fraud operations last year. Of the advertiser accounts it shut down, he said, nearly 70% were caught within a week of their creation.Because of a safe harbor in U.S. telecommunications law known as section 230, platforms are generally shielded from liability for user-created content. Whether those protections apply to Meta's ads is now being tested by Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining billionaire and philanthropist who became frustrated in 2019 with Meta's failure to remove fraudulent investment advertisements using his image and AI-cloned voice.In a motion to dismiss the case last year, Meta argued that it is under no obligation to require investment advertisers to verify their identities or demonstrate that they're licensed to sell such products.""Because Meta has no duty to protect users from third-party content on its platform, Plaintiff cannot state a negligence claim,"" the company said.Write to Jeff Horwitz at jeff.horwitz@wsj.com and Angel Au-Yeung at angel.au-yeung@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515014756:0/
Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
"Markets Mostly Up on Mid-East Wheeling, Dealing",1747346880000,"Thursday, May 15, 2025Markets closed mostly up this session on moderately good news rippling through economic concerns throughout the day. With President Trump continuing his tour through the Middle East, we’re seeing a plethora of deals being made there with American corporations:Boeing BA will send more than 200 jets to Qatar Airways, $142 billion in military equipment investments will go to Saudi Arabia, billions more in Saudi infrastructure with supplies from AMD AMD, Cisco CSCO and others, and 18K AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA will be sent to a company chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.The Dow gained +271 points today, +0.65%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.52%. The Nasdaq, which has risen +13% over the past month, faltered this afternoon following news reports of an SEC investigation into Coinbase COIN and a cybersecurity hack, sending the stock down -7% today. Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks. But we we see Import and Export Prices ahead of the open, as well as Housing Starts and Building Permits — all for April. Earlier today, we saw a sagging Homebuilders Confidence survey for May, as high mortgage and home prices are remaining out of range for many prospective buyers, with many others feeling prices may be due to come down over the coming months. We’ll also see a new preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey for May on Friday, as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Meta Shares Dip as German Court Backs AI Data Use,1748020042000,"Meta NASDAQ:META slips 1.11% as German court refuses to block AI training on Facebook and Instagram data.Shares of Meta fell just over 1% after Verbraucherzentrale NRW lost its bid for a preliminary injunction aimed at stopping the company from using EU user posts to train its AI models. In April, Meta announced it would begin tapping interactions and public adult content on Facebook and Instagram for model training, having postponed similar plans last year amid regulatory uncertainty.This follows March's rollout of Meta's AI chatbot service in Europe after a year-long delay. An Austrian group, noyb, also sought an injunction earlier this month over the same data-use plans. Meta said navigating the EU's complex regulatory system took longer than expected but that it was glad we're finally here, underscoring its push to bolster AI capabilities on the continent.Why It Matters: Continued legal challenges in Europe could slow Meta's AI roadmap and weigh on growth if enforcement tightens around user-data usage.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:2bd3446cf094b:0-meta-shares-dip-as-german-court-backs-ai-data-use/

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Meta's Upside Jumps Nearly 40% as Loop Capital Raises Target,1747929393000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META gained fresh momentum after Loop Capital lifted its price target to $888 from $695, while keeping a Buy rating, according to a Thursday research note.The new forecast implies about 40% upside from current levels, reflecting the firm's confidence in Meta's growth trajectory.Loop Capital highlighted Meta's leading position among non-hardware beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, suggesting the stock may outperform its Magnificent Seven peers this year. Sanderson also pointed to Meta's stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter outlook as a key driver.Earlier concerns that reduced ad spending by China-based retailers would drag on revenue have eased. Meta confirmed in April that some Chinese online merchants cut back ads on Facebook and Instagram amid President Donald Trump's trade policies toward China. However, advancements in AI tools and services have helped offset those headwinds, according to Loop Capital.Despite broader market volatility, the bullish call underscores growing optimism around Meta's ability to monetize its AI investments and sustain ad revenue growth. Investors will watch the company's upcoming earnings report for further clues on whether Meta can meet heightened expectations and validate its lofty valuation.Is META Stock a Buy?Based on the one year price targets offered by 60 analysts, the average target price for Meta Platforms Inc is $706.21 with a high estimate of $935.00 and a low estimate of $466.00. The average target implies a upside of +11.13% from the current price of $635.50.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Meta Platforms Inc in one year is $531.47, suggesting a downside of -16.37% from the current price of $635.50",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:9ca087414094b:0-meta-s-upside-jumps-nearly-40-as-loop-capital-raises-target/
"Meta to Delay Rollout of Flagship AI Model Nicknamed 'Behemoth,' Sources Say — WSJ",1747336620000,"By Meghan Bobrowsky and Sam SchechnerMeta is delaying the rollout of a flagship AI model, prompting internal concerns about the direction of its multibillion-dollar AI investments, people familiar with the matter said.Company engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its ""Behemoth"" large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release, the people said.Early in its development, Behemoth was internally slated for an April release to coincide with Meta's inaugural AI conference for developers. Meta put out two smaller models in its Llama AI model family ahead of the event, but later pushed an internal target for the larger Behemoth's release to June. Now, it's been delayed to fall or later.Meta has previously drawn praise for the speed with which it's caught up to rivals in the global AI arms race--spending billions of dollars along the way to develop the technology that powers chatbots on WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. Meta plans to spend up to $72 billion in capital expenditures this year, much of which will be used to help realize Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's grand ambitions for AI.Zuckerberg and other Meta executives haven't publicly committed to a timeline for Behemoth. The company could ultimately decide to release Behemoth sooner than expected, including by rolling out a more limited version. But Meta engineers and researchers are concerned its performance wouldn't match public statements about its capabilities, the people said.A Meta spokesman declined to comment.Senior executives at the company are frustrated at the performance of the team that built the Llama 4 models and blame them for the failure to make progress on Behemoth, according to people familiar with their views. Meta is contemplating significant management changes to its AI product group as a result, the people said.The Facebook-parent has publicly touted the capabilities of Behemoth, saying it already outperforms similar technology from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on some tests. But internally, its performance has been hobbled by training challenges, the people said.Meta's recent challenges mirror stumbles or delays at other top AI companies that are trying to release their next big state-of-the-art models. Some researchers see the pattern as evidence that future advances in AI models could come at a far slower pace than in the past, and at tremendous cost.""Right now, the progress is quite small across all the labs, all the models,"" said Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an assistant professor and faculty fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science.GPT-5, one of OpenAI's next big technological leaps forward, was initially expected around mid-2024, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. In December, The Journal reported that development on the model was running behind schedule.In February, OpenAI Chief Sam Altman said the model would be released as GPT-4.5 and that GPT-5 — the model they hoped would come with bigger technological breakthroughs — was still months away. ChatGPT currently runs on versions of GPT-4o. OpenAI declined to comment on the timing of GPT-5's release.Anthropic last year said it was working on a new model called Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger version of the AI models it released last year and has continued to update. That heftier version still hasn't been released. A spokeswoman says Opus is coming soon.Meta's first version of Llama was produced by its Fundamental AI Research Team, which largely consists of academics and researchers with doctorate degrees. The team released the models and a research paper explaining them to the public in early 2023.Since then, 11 of the 14 researchers on that original paper have left the company. The Llama models since the first ones have been developed by a different team. The Information earlier reported on problems Meta was having with some of its recent Llama models.The two models that were released in April initially performed well on a popular AI chatbot leaderboard. However, it was later revealed that the model submitted to the leaderboard was not the same model that was released to the public.Representatives for the leaderboard said Meta should have made it clearer that it had submitted a customized model intended to do well on its benchmark test. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Meta submitted a version of its AI model to the leaderboard that was optimized to do well on the third-party performance test.Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at Sam.Schechner@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515011062:0/

Meta Platforms vs. Microsoft: Which AI Superpower is a Better Buy?,1747335600000,"Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies. Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month. Microsoft is now extending Copilot’s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft.

Wall Street futures slip after three-day rally as traders await Powell speech,1747307739000,"US stock futures edged lower Thursday after three straight days of gains, as markets digested a temporary truce in U.S.-China tariff tensions and eyed fresh economic data for clues on inflation and growth. All eyes now turn to US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to speak at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C., on May 15. Powell faces mounting pressure from President Trump, who has been openly urging the Fed to begin cutting interest rates.Futures linked to the S&P 500 were down 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.7 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also declined, falling 128 points, or 0.3 percent.Also read: Told Apple CEO Tim Cook that I don't want him to build in India: Donald TrumpThe cautious mood followed news that Washington and Beijing have paused their tit-for-tat tariff war, easing some pressure on equities. Confidence in the near-term market outlook got a further lift earlier this week from promising US inflation data and signs of resilient tech momentum.Among individual names, Foot Locker shares skyrocketed over 68 percent after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Dick’s Sporting Goods is nearing a $2.3 billion acquisition deal for the footwear retailer. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth dropped 6 percent following reports of a Justice Department probe—although the company said it has not been notified of any such investigation.Tech giants continued to lead the rally this week.

Economists expect the headline PPI to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month in April, with the core figure, which excludes food and energy, also forecast to increase 0.3 percent.Investors will also parse through retail sales, industrial production, and weekly jobless claims data, all scheduled for release before the market opens.

"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H.

"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta ",1747295340000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 15, 2025 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues.""Making Sense of the Evolving Earnings PictureNote: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates. - We continue to believe that this earnings season was less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the evolving macroeconomic and public policy backdrop. To that end, management commentary has largely been reassuring despite the uncertainty. - Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been under pressure, with bigger declines in estimates compared to other recent post-COVID periods. That said, estimates for the Tech sector have notably stabilized lately. - For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. Q2 estimates have been steadily coming down, with the magnitude and breadth of negative estimate revisions greater than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.What’s Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates?The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariff uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have declined since the quarter began.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.4% in Q2 on +9.8% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed course in recent weeks, as we have been flagging lately.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector’s estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector’s Q2 estimates at least proves that the shift to the annual growth pace isn’t solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly from the Mag 7 players. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company’s current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.You can rest assured that we will be closely monitoring the Tech sector’s revisions trend in the days ahead.The Earnings Big PictureWhile estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven’t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy’s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

$30B AI Opportunity: Will It Power Meta’s Next Surge?,1747864260000,"Magnificent Seven giant Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META has been no stranger to Wall Street analyst upgrades lately. After the company’s last earnings report, nearly 20 analysts tracked by MarketBeat increased their price targets on the stock. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] More recently, analysts at Wolfe Research issued a substantial  price target update on Meta of $750. This implies a significant potential upside in Meta shares of nearly 18% from its May 20 closing price.Mark Zuckerberg recently shared five key AI growth opportunities for the company. This makes an earlier piece of Wolfe's research particularly relevant. Wolfe has referenced the huge growth potential of one opportunity that Zuckerberg mentioned: business messaging. It sees business messaging as a possible $30–$40 billion opportunity for Meta.Zuckerberg's recent comments suggest that business messaging might help Meta hit Wolfe's $750 12-month price target. This analysis will break down Meta’s ambitions in business messaging and show just how powerful they could be for the tech stock.Over a Third of the World Population Is Using WhatsAppAside from Facebook and Instagram, Meta also owns possibly the world’s most-used direct messaging app, WhatsApp . In Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated that WhatsApp has over 3 billion monthly active users . That is equal to around 38% of the world’s population of 8 billion. Zuckerberg also said that more than one billion people use Facebook Messenger every month.Additionally, users send just as many messages on Instagram each day as they do on Messenger. He summed up this massive user count and activity data by saying, “So, Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.""It looks like Meta is gearing up to start aggressively monetizing its huge messaging user base. This could kick off the path toward Meta executing on Wolfe’s massive total addressable market revenue estimates in this space. Wolfe estimates that Meta is only generating around $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue from WhatsApp. That lines up with Meta’s latest earnings. Meta's Other Family of Apps Revenue, which houses WhatsApp, generated around $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. It also generated $510 million in revenue last quarter, growing by 34% from a year ago.Wolfe’s Estimates Indicate a Huge Opportunity for MetaAlthough the timeline around which Wolfe sees Meta achieving $30–$40 billion in business messaging revenue is uncertain, it could clearly be a huge growth driver for Meta. At the midpoints of Wolfe’s estimates , this would mean a 20x increase in Meta’s business messaging revenue . Additionally, $35 billion in business messaging revenue would be equal to over 20% of the $170 billion that Meta generated in the last 12 months. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Meta intends to increase the monetization of business messaging using AI. Zuckerberg envisions every company using an "" AI business agen t."" This agent handles customer service and runs sales campaigns through direct messaging. Meta would then presumably charge companies to do this through its messaging apps.Meta has already seen companies in Thailand and Vietnam using its messaging apps to aid their business. However, they use humans to do so because the cost of labor in those countries is low. The company believes that the use of AI agents can make doing this profitable in developed countries.However, Meta’s focus on monetizing AI in developed countries is somewhat curious. Only around 100 million of WhatsApp’s 3 billion monthly active users are in the United States. Additionally, data shows that most WhatsApp users are in emerging economies. If these economies already have low labor costs, will AI agents really change the adoption of business messaging? While they might not make a difference in whether business messaging is profitable overall in these countries, there is a solid chance they could  raise profitability , thus increasing adoption. This remains to be seen, as Meta is currently testing these AI features. Additionally, an amount of 100 million users is still around 30% of the population in the United States, meaning there is a big opportunity at home as well.With Proper Execution, Business Messaging Could Be Meta’s Next Big HitOverall, Meta’s business messaging ambitions should be a key area of focus for investors going forward. However, it seems reasonable to pump the brakes on Wolfe’s huge forecasts in this area until more tangible results for Meta’s AI agents surface. If successful, business messaging represents a huge possible growth opportunity for one of the most dominant technology names in the world.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:dd1dc9895094b:0-30b-ai-opportunity-will-it-power-meta-s-next-surge/
Britain tells antitrust regulator to focus on economic growth,1747263660000,"Britain on Thursday told its antitrust regulator to get behind its push for economic growth and minimise uncertainty for businesses by making more timely, transparent and responsive interventions in merger control, digital markets and consumer protection.Since taking power last year, the Labour government has stepped up pressure on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and other regulators, demanding they play their part in tearing down barriers that hold back growth.The CMA is independent but it follows a ""strategic steer"" set by the secretary of state for business. ""Our economic regulators are crucial to creating the conditions for increased growth and investment,"" Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said in a government statement. ""This steer sets out the government's priorities for the CMA."" Reynolds signalled the CMA's new steer in February , saying it needed to be ""less risk-adverse"". The CMA gained new powers to scrutinise ""big tech"" companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon at the beginning of this year, adding to a widened remit to police mergers after Brexit.Prime Minister Keir Starmer singled the CMA out last year as a regulator that needed to take economic growth more seriously. The government reinforced the point by making former Amazon executive Doug Gurr interim chair of the CMA in January.CMA CEO Sarah Cardell said the government had situated a strong competition regime ""squarely in the context of the growth mission"".""The steer provides helpful clarity on how the CMA should prioritise and go about our work, promoting competition and protecting consumers with a sharp focus on supporting higher levels of investment and economic growth,"" she said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RM28Z:0-britain-tells-antitrust-regulator-to-focus-on-economic-growth/"

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.43 billion people daily. Meta Platforms’ growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>> )Shares of Honeywell have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+13.3% vs. +11.1%). The company’s strength in the commercial aviation and building automation businesses augurs well. The Aerospace segment is particularly strong, driven by strength in the defense business and growth in air transport flight hours. Strong demand across the commercial aviation aftermarket business is aiding the segment. The company also continues to reward shareholders, which adds to the stock’s appeal. While acquisitions have expanded its product range and geographic reach, they have increased the company’s balance sheet debt as well. However, weakness in the Industrial Automation segment, due to lower demand for smart energy and thermal solutions, is worrisome. The weakened demand for personal protective equipment within the sensing and safety technologies business is also concerning. Foreign currency translation remains an overhang.(You can read the full research report on Honeywell here >>> )Automatic Data Processing’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+10.9% vs. +6.7%). The company aspires to grow on the back of its three-tier business strategy and use its transformation initiatives to innovate and expand margins. Acquisitions have been pivotal in ADP’s ability to operate across borders. Automatic Data Processing pursues buyouts that complement the overall business mix. This stock is an eye candy for dividend-seeking investors. The recent rise in the current ratio suggests a robust liquidity position for the company. Meanwhile, rising expenses due to acquisitions and investments are worrisome and can affect profitability. Automatic Data Processing faces high competition, which shoots talent costs sky-high and can affect the company’s growth. The stock increased 29.8% in a year and we have a Neutral recommendation on it in anticipation of a correction.(You can read the full research report on Automatic Data Processing here >>> )Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Quanta Services, Inc.

DELL Surges 37% in a Month: Should You Buy the Stock Now or Wait?,1747839780000,"Dell Technologies DELL shares have surged 36.6% over the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 18.8% and the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry’s growth of 4.3%. The outperformance can be attributed to DELL’s expanding portfolio and rich partner base. The company, through its infrastructure solutions, provides essential hardware and services that support cloud environments. DELL is transforming modern data centers with disaggregated infrastructure solutions that integrate storage, cyber resilience, software, and automation.Addressing the evolving demands of on-premises, cloud, and edge environments, DELL empowers organizations to efficiently manage and secure workloads with advanced storage systems like Power Protect Data Domain and PowerScale, enhanced by AI-driven ransomware detection. Its automated Private Cloud and NativeEdge offerings streamline deployment and management, enabling faster provisioning and consistent control across diverse infrastructures. DELL’s comprehensive approach ensures modern data centers are agile, secure, and ready for future challenges.One Month PerformanceDELL’s Expanding Portfolio Aids ProspectDell Technologies’ expanding portfolio has been a key catalyst. The company has added major upgrades to its AI Factory, introducing energy-efficient infrastructure and advanced cooling solutions. These updates aim to simplify and accelerate enterprise AI deployments across edge, data center, and cloud environments.Dell Technologies is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, DELL’s AI-optimized server momentum saw an increase of $1.7 billion in orders. The company shipped $2.1 billion worth of AI servers in the fiscal fourth quarter, and the AI server backlog remained healthy at $4.1 billion.Dell PowerEdge supports the NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell Ultra platform, including the upcoming NVIDIA HGX B300 NVL16, NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition.DELL Benefits From Expanding ClienteleDELL is benefiting from an expanding partner base that includes NVIDIA, Worley, Microsoft, Meta Platforms META, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Imbue. In May 2025, Dell Technologies announced major advancements across the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA to accelerate enterprise AI adoption. These include next-generation PowerEdge servers, enhanced AI data platforms, integrated software solutions, and new managed services for streamlined AI deployment.Dell Technologies collaborated with Meta Platforms to make it easy for its customers to deploy Meta Platforms’ Llama 2 models on-premises with Dell Technologies’ AI-optimized portfolio.In February 2025, Dell Technologies expanded its AI for Telecom program through a collaboration with Advanced Micro Devices to develop AI solutions that enhance real-time telecom network monitoring and management using Dell PowerEdge XE7745 servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices EPYC processors.Dell Technologies Offers Positive Q1 FY26 GuidanceDell Technologies’ innovative portfolio, expanding partner base and growing AI footprint are major growth drivers. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues are expected to be between $22.5 billion and $23.5 billion, with the mid-point of $23 billion suggesting 3% year-over-year growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dell Technologies’ first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $23.1 billion, suggesting growth of 3.85% year over year.Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.65 per share (+/- 10 cents), indicating 25% growth at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.48 per share, which has increased by a penny in the past 30 days. This indicates year-over-year growth of 42.12%.Dell Technologies Inc.

Cautious spending by enterprises and large customers on PCs and storage IT has been a concern for DELL’s investors.Increasing competition in the AI data center market, along with a higher mix of AI-optimized servers, is expected to hurt gross margin expansion in the near term. Additionally, investor sentiment has also soured amid rising trade tension, with additional tariffs raising fears of escalating costs. DELL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

CoreWeave: Riding the AI Wave Ahead of Earnings,1747229520000,"What Does CoreWeave Do?In simple terms, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock CoreWeave ( CRWV ) is an AI cloud-computing company that functions as a massive computer rental platform, providing super-powered services for artificial intelligence operations and other resource-intensive tasks. The late 2022 launch of OpenAI and Microsoft’s ( MSFT ) ChatGPT chatbot illustrated how significant AI technology is and is likely to become when it became the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Since then, big-tech, “Magnificent 7” companies like Meta Platforms ( META ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars of CAPEX on data centers and the GPUs that are necessary to train large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.Coreweave, founded in 2017, initially provided data center capability to Bitcoin miners. However, a crypto crash would alter the company’s trajectory the next year forever. Instead of focusing on crypto, CoreWeave’s management team correctly predicted that the next (and much larger) wave of data center demand would come from AI. Thus, the company pivoted, and growth exploded.CoreWeave: The Biggest Tech IPO Since 2021In late March, CoreWeave launched its IPO, raising $1.5 billion. While the $1.5 billion was lower than CoreWeave wanted to raise and below Wall Street’s expectations, context is critical. The market conditions at the time were dire, with an intensifying trade war between the world’s two largest economies. In most cases, a tech company would simply shelf its IPO. More importantly, China’s DeepSeek large language model had just launched and claimed to provide a ChatGPT-like product with far less compute.CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator would later say that demand had actually picked up in the wake of the DeepSeek madness. Later, Wall Street analysts would also debunk DeepSeek’s claims. Despite the uncertainty and investor skittishness, CRWV management forged ahead and launched the IPO, marking the largest tech IPO in years.CoreWeave: The Google 2004 PrecedentFamed investor Jesse Livermore once proclaimed, “There is nothing new on Wall Street. There can’t be, because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market has happened before.” While history doesn’t always repeat exactly, it does tend to rhyme.In 2004, GOOGL launched its IPO. GOOGL shares would more than triple in a year, and would never look back. Now, CRWV exhibits some of the same characteristics, including:· IPO U-turn Base:In 2004, GOOGL shares spiked in their first few sessions, fell, and finally carved out a short, multi-week rounded base, which I call an IPO “U-turn” base.Image Source: TradingViewCRWV’s current chart pattern mirros the 2004 GOOGL IPO and should act as a valuable precedent for investors.Image Source: TradingView· Explosive Revenue GrowthIn the year prior before its IPO, Google’s revenue jumped from $961.90 million to $2.7 billion. Meanwhile, CoreWeave’s revenue grew at a blistering 725% in the year prior to its IPO.· Institutional SponsorshipDeep-pocketed institutional investors drove Google’s mind-boggling ascent, and now they are doing the same for CoreWeave. For instance, Nvidia ( NVDA ), the undisputed AI leader, owns 6% of CRWV. According to its latest filing BlackRock ( BLK ), the world’s largest asset manager, owns 250,000 shares. Meanwhile, Fidelity disclosed a 9% stake in the firm earlier this week.· New Technology WaveGoogle benefitted from riding the technological wave known as the internet. Now, CRWV is riding the newest and arguably fastest-growing wave in history: artificial intelligence.Fib Targets CRWVCorewWeave will report earnings after the close today, May 14th. If the company impress Wall Street, the Fibonacci targets are much higher.Image Source: TradingViewBottom LineAs CoreWeave prepares to unveil its earnings report, the echoes of Google’s historic IPO and the robust institutional backing paint an optimistic picture for this AI cloud-computing pioneer.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2452d0f2e094b:0-coreweave-riding-the-ai-wave-ahead-of-earnings/

Google’s smart glasses bet with Warby Parker could also benefit this other eyewear maker,1747834192000,"Google’s renewed push into the smart glasses market through new partnerships with Warby Parker and luxury fashion group Kering will also benefit EssilorLuxottica- the company behind Ray-Ban smart glasses made with Meta- and accelerate the broad adoption of smart glasses, analysts say. Both Warby Parker and Kering, in separate announcements on Tuesday, said they are working with Google to develop glasses embedded with artificial intelligence, using Android XR, a version of the Android operating system tailored for headsets and glasses.The collaboration with Warby Parker is particularly significant as Google is investing up to $75 million in the company’s product development and commercialization costs.The companies plan to unveil their first product line after 2025, with a series of offerings expected to follow.The two partnerships signal Google’s broader strategy to re-enter a market it helped pioneer, but exited early. Google Glass was once at the forefront of wearable innovation but was eventually shelved due to privacy concerns and tepid consumer interest.Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba described the Google-Warby partnership as a “dream scenario” and predicted rapid expansion of the smart glasses category. “We expect smartglasses growth to be exponential over the next few years, particularly given the product is squarely at the intersection of wearable technology and AI,” he wrote.Deal could accelerate adoption of smart glassesInvestor response to the announcements was swift. Warby Parker shares closed up 16% at $20.34 on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism that the collaboration could mark a turning point for the company’s growth. Shares of Innovative Eyewear, a smaller smart glasses maker, rose 12% to $3.02. Meanwhile, Vuzix, another competitor in the space, fell 3% to $2.46.Jefferies analysts said Google’s partnership with both Warby Parker and Kering to develop artificial intelligence-powered glasses could help accelerate the adoption of smart glasses.They said that Warby Parker is less influential than EssilorLuxottica, the eyewear which with its partner Meta, leads the smartglasses category.“However, seeing established companies work on smart glasses suggests they might become mainstream soon,” they add. Deal validates the success of EssilorLuxottica and Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glassesThe renewed interest in smart glasses comes as demand for AI-integrated wearables appears to be rising. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently reported a surge in demand for Ray-Ban smart glasses, with 2 million units sold by the end of 2024. A new model is expected to launch later this year.Equita Sim analyst Domenico Ghilotti said EssilorLuxottica should benefit from Google’s partnership as the move validates the success of Meta and EssilorLuxottica’s offering and underlines the growing importance of smart eyewear as a channel for deploying consumer AI. “The deal signals the expected reaction of players like Google to the commercial success of Ray-Ban smart glasses, which EssilorLuxottica develops with Meta Platforms,” Ghilotti says. It marks “a confirmation of the growing relevance of this product for the penetration of AI solutions,” the analyst adds.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:b340422be094b:0-google-s-smart-glasses-bet-with-warby-parker-could-also-benefit-this-other-eyewear-maker/
"Is META Stock's 24.18X PE Still Worth it? Buy, Sell, or Hold?",1747153140000,"Meta Platforms META shares are trading at a premium as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E), META is trading at 24.18X, a premium compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 23.72X. Meta Platforms shares are trading at a premium compared to its closest peer in the digital advertising domain, Alphabet GOOGL, but at a discount compared with Amazon AMZN. In terms of the forward 12-month P/E, Alphabet shares are trading at 16.26X, while Amazon is trading at 31.44X. Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to absorb roughly 50% of the projected global ad spending by 2028.P/E Ratio (F12M)Although higher tariffs and a prolonged trade war have the potential to hurt digital advertising spending, negatively impacting prospects, we believe Meta Platforms’ AI focus is a key catalyst. Meta Platforms’ focus on leveraging AI to improve user engagement is noteworthy. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement. Amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Meta Platforms shares have appreciated 9.2% year to date, outperforming the broader sector as well as peers, including Alphabet and Amazon, shares of which have dropped 4.9% and 16.3%, respectively.META Stock’s PerformanceMETA shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.META Shares Trade Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs  META Leverages AI to Boost Advertising RevenuesMeta Platforms focuses on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA NVDA. The deployment of META’s deep neural network on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip across Instagram and Facebook applications has achieved more than 6% recall improvement to the retrieval system while delivering over 8% ad quality improvement on selected segments. Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that was used on Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months. META’s growing focus on social commerce through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is noteworthy. In first-quarter 2025, WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions contributed to deliver 34% year-over-year growth in Family of Apps other revenues, reaching $510 million.META’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward MovementThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.84 per share, up by 3.2% over the past 30 days, indicating a 13.18% year-over-year increase.META’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.30%. Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and Consensus Meta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote Here’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right NowAI usage is making META a popular name among advertisers as well as users.However, operating expenses are expected in the $114-$119 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Generative AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs, make the stock a risky bet.META is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by its Gen AI initiatives and core business. Although these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe the lack of monetization of new platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. The company doesn’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. Meta Platforms plans to focus on scaling and deepening engagements for Meta AI over the next few years.META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

Tap Mag-7 ETFs on Temporary US-China Trade Truce,1747133160000,"The group of tech giants — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta  META — known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" has been battered by the tariff turmoil.  Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF  MAGS has lost 6.4% so far this year (as of May 12, 2025) against a loss of 0.3% seen in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.The latest U.S.-China temporary trade truce came as a surprising relief to the space. Responding to the trade deal, MAGS ETF surged 5.8% on May 12. The ETF has, in fact, surged 12.9% over the past month.The recent rebound follows a rough period for Big Tech after President Donald Trump announced a ""reciprocal tariff"" plan on April 2, which wiped out $2 trillion in cumulative market cap from the Magnificent Seven.Mag-7 Stock Performance Highlights Post US-China Trade TruceAmazon and Meta Platforms spearheaded a significant rally among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks on May 12 afternoon, following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China.Stock Performance Highlights Amazon surged 8.1% and Meta climbed 7.9% on May 12. Tesla gained 6.8%, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion. Apple rose 6.3%. NVIDIA jumped 5.4%. Google shares increased 3.4%. Microsoft added 2.4%.Trade Truce DetailsThe United States agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on Chinese imports. The United States cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered American levies from 125% to 10%.These reductions will last 90 days, following two days of high-stakes talks between the two nations. The new tariffs on small packages sent from China worth up to $800 have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement.Bullish Outlook for Tech SectorThe trade development is highly optimistic for tech stocks, particularly due to the easing of supply-chain concerns. Along with Apple, Tesla is also heavily dependent on Chinese parts and battery suppliers. No wonder, both shares surged. Moreover, Tesla is expected to debut its self-driving Taxi in June.Impact of China on Big TechAmazon : 30% of product value on its platform comes from China; Chinese advertisers made up 14% of ad revenues in 2024, per Raymond James, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Meta : Chinese advertisers contributed roughly 11% of total ad spending, Raymon James noted.Google : Chinese advertisers accounted for about 6% of ad revenues, Raymon James indicated.Apple : 90% of iPhones are manufactured in China, representing 17% of 2024 revenues .NVIDIA : Chinese clients make up between 20% and 40% of the company’s end customer base, according to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Any Wall of Worry?Despite the temporary truce, the United States has imposed export bans on NVIDIA’s H20 AI chips to China, which has pressured NVDA shares. Hence, many are of the view that the phase of group-wide Mag-7 rallies appears to be over, replaced by a more scrutinized stock selection. However, no one still underrates the opportunities in the Mag-7 group.ETF PicksAnd if you want to go for group-wide picks, you have options like MAGS,  Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF  MGK,  Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF  XLG and  iShares S&P 100 ETF  OEF to play on.Meta-heavy ETFs like Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF  FCOM can be played for specific stock preference. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY invests about 35% of its basket in Amazon and Tesla.While tensions are still present around chip restrictions (H20/NVDA), the stock cannot be ignored due to continued chip demand. So, keep a close look at the NVDA-heavy Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF  SHOC.And if you like the resilience in MSFT shares and the recent rebound in the Apple stock, you can tap iShares Global Tech ETF IXN. The ETF also invests about 35% of its portfolio in the duo.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:518920b92094b:0-tap-mag-7-etfs-on-temporary-us-china-trade-truce/
Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college. If they choose not to go to college, the trust will remain till they reach 21.

Meta Shares Rise as Tariff Overhang Clears for Asia-Based Advertisers — WSJ,1747088280000,"By Meghan BobrowskyMeta's stock had a good day.Shares of the Facebook parent closed up nearly 8% after President Trump said the U.S. and China reached a deal to temporarily roll back tariffs. The social-media giant's chief financial officer said last month that the company had seen reduced ad spending from Asia-based e-commerce retailers in April. More than 10% of Meta's revenue came from China in 2024.Mark Mahaney, head of Evercore ISI's Internet research team, said the stock was up because uncertainty with its China business was the main tariff concern the company mentioned on its most recent earnings call.""The only area of weakness they called out was China-based advertisers,"" he said.The de minimus loophole--an exemption that previously waived tariffs on packages coming into the U.S. whose goods were valued at $800 or less--was closed earlier this month and remains closed. Retailers in China had previously taken advantage of the loophole.It is unclear how the closing of the loophole has affected or will continue to affect Meta's business.This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

"U.S., Chinese Markets Cruise on Cooling Trade Tensions",1747087260000,"Monday, May 12, 2025Markets posted one of its strongest sessions of 2025 so far. We’ve had a volatile first half of the year, and we might expect that volatility to continue. But with all the ups and downs, today’s big day into the green has brought the S&P 500 within 5% of its all-time trading high. The Dow and S&P 500 are within 1% of posting profits year to date.The Dow shot up 1160 points today, for a +2.81% gain — and it was the laggard among the major indexes. The S&P 500 grew +184 points, +3.26%. The Nasdaq, which one the day on strength in tech stocks, was up a whopping +779 points, +4.35%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained +68 points, +3.40%.Of course, the catalyst for this seismic shift comes from the agreement between the U.S. and China to pause their reciprocal tariffs (which had ballooned to +145% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and +125% on U.S. exports to China). Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META were both up +8% today, leading the way for “Mag 7” stocks.Chinese stocks also saw a bounce today, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining +3% today, for its best trading day since March. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar is back up to its one-month high, and Gold — which had been a demonstrative hedge when the equities market was melting away, just a few short weeks ago — is down -3% today.What to Expect from the Stock Market TomorrowThe big news tomorrow — though unlikely to make as big a splash as this tariff pause did today — is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April. Headline month over month CPI is expected to provide the biggest swing: +0.2% versus -0.1% reported a month ago, +0.3% on core versus +0.1% for March. Year over year, headline is expected to remain steady at +2.4%, and steady at +2.8% on core year over year.These figures, should they come in as expected, would still be notably above the optimal levels the Fed targets for inflation. Market strength and an absence of economic troubles that harsh tariff policies set in motion will likely keep any interest rate cuts at bay for now anyway, with the probability of a June rate cut tumbling from 64.4% to 8.1% today. The highest probability for the first cut of 2025 is currently the September meeting. Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Stocks to Watch as the U.S. & China Reach a Trade Deal,1747086840000,"Stocks surged on Monday as the U.S. and China announced a deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs, leading to much optimism that a global economic recession may be avoided.Easing an ongoing trade war, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, with China reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement will last 90 days, as the two sides work on building a sustainable, long-term trade relationship.The S&P 500 rose +3% in today’s trading session, with the Nasdaq spiking over +4%, as investors flock to big tech stocks that had sold off during rising trade tensions.The Mag 7 At the center of what has been a historic market rebound are the mega-cap big tech stocks, with Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Tesla TSLA leading the market gains on Monday and up over +6% respectively. It’s likely that analysts may become more bullish on Apple’s short-term outlook as most of the electronic giant’s production comes from China. A continued run-up in Apple, Amazon, and Meta stock looks fundamentally plausible, but it’s noteworthy that Tesla lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on a trend of declining earnings estimate revisions. Suggesting now may be a good time to fade the rally in Tesla stock is that TSLA has spiked +25% in the last month. Furthermore, Tesla has the highest P/E valuation among the Mag 7 at 161.4X forward earnings, with Alphabet GOOGL being the cheapest at 16.2X.Nvidia NVDA and Microsoft MSFT have started to gain nice momentum as well, although the latter was only up +2% today. Still, Microsoft is the only Mag 7 stock that currently has a buy rating with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the others all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) outside of Tesla’s strong sell rating. This comes as fiscal 2025 EPS estimates for Microsoft are up 2% over the last 60 days, with FY26 EPS estimates up 1%. Alibaba & TencentOptimistically, Chinese tech stocks have already benefited from higher investor sentiment before the tariff truce with the U.S., as Chinese President Xi Jinping has been more supportive of their independent growth. With regulatory issues being less of a concern to investors, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY are two Chinese tech stocks to pay attention to and currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Their ADR’s (American Depository Receipts) have been two of the top performers on U.S. stock exchanges this year, with BABA soaring nearly +60% year to date and TCEHY up over +20%. The strong price performance has been due to their artificial intelligence expansion, leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience, as Alibaba has seen higher e-commerce sales, and Tencent has benefited from growth in its gaming and cloud services. Retail Stocks Outside of Amazon and Apple, retailers like Nike NKE, Starbucks SBUX, and even Walmart WMT and Target TGT rely heavily on supply chain operations from China. Nike and Starbucks also generate a significant portion of their revenue from their operations within China, which would make better trade and political relations between the U.S. and China beneficial to their outlook.Nike and Walmart stock stand out with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Starbucks and Target have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Plus, China accounted for 14% of Nike’s revenue in 2024, with $5.5 billion coming from footwear sales alone, as shown in the chart below.Image Source: StatistaEnergy & Transportation Stocks Energy and transportation stocks will also be important to watch, as they could receive a continued boost in the following weeks thanks to today’s trade agreement. While geopolitical tensions can often cause an uptick in crude oil prices, the trade war between the U.S. and China had an adverse effect in regard to how the market saw future demand for travel and other activities that require higher energy production. Crude prices were up as much as +2% to over $62 a barrel but are still down 20% in 2025.Image Source: Trading Economics Bottom Line The U.S. and China trade agreement gave the market what it was looking for, as investors now have more reassurance that the global economy will be less impacted by higher tariffs. That said, keeping an eye on the progress that is hopefully made in the next 90 days will be critical, considering the U.S. and China are the world's two largest economies.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7a4eb6869094b:0-stocks-to-watch-as-the-u-s-china-reach-a-trade-deal/

Wall Street Logs Best Day in More Than Four Weeks After US-China Tariff Pact,1747083713000,"Wall Street's benchmark indexes posted their biggest one-day gains in more than four weeks on Monday after the US and China agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. The Nasdaq Composite closed 4.4% higher at 18,708.3, the S&P 500 climbed 3.3% to 5,844.2, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.8% to 42,410.1.

The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month.

BlackRock expects continued high volatility due to slower growth and evolving trade dynamics.A resilient labor market and potential tariff-driven inflation could limit the Fed's capacity to cut rates. In this environment, low-volatility strategies and defensive stocks may help reduce portfolio risk.The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF USMV—the most popular fund in the space—selects and weights stocks to create a portfolio with lower volatility relative to the broader market. The strategy uses optimization, accounting for both the correlation between stocks and their individual volatility.AI beneficiaries struggled earlier this year, particularly following DeepSeek’s AI reveal and growing concerns over trade wars. However, recent big tech earnings suggest the AI trade is far from slowing down.Google GOOG and Microsoft MSFT reaffirmed their spending plans, while Meta META raised its full-year capital expenditure guidance. This is good news for NVIDIA NVDA, which remains the biggest beneficiary of the massive AI buildout.Software ETFs like the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV are also worth considering, as these companies stand to benefit from declining AI costs and increasing adoption.Amid uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, BlackRock favors the shorter end of the yield curve. Furthermore, as bonds no longer offer the same diversification benefits, they did in previous decades, investors should consider gold and other alternative assets.Tune in to the podcast to learn more!Make sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of ETF Spotlight!

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

The AI Diffusion Rule is Over. What That Means for Trump and China. — Barrons.com,1747747020000,"By Justin ShermanAbout the author: Justin Sherman is the founder and CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, a research and advisory firm, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.In a major trade and security pivot, President Donald Trump has scrapped his predecessor's so-called artificial intelligence diffusion rule that was set to be implemented last week. That rule, signed by President Joe Biden in his final days in office, added export controls on integrated circuits and AI models to countries such as China and Iran — with big exemptions for friendly nations such as Germany. Some U.S. AI and chip companies are cheering on this reversal, their present view reflecting that of a Commerce Department spokesperson: Biden's AI rule was ""overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation.""At face value, it seems the leading industry players and the U.S. government are on the same page: Companies want to build and sell chips and AI products globally, and the administration wants U.S. industry to boom. Both worry about Beijing's AI capabilities and threats to U.S. national security. Same talk, same page.But many chip and AI companies' talk about national security and China is more or less just that — talk. For some firms, talking about China and national security is simply a way to frame their own priorities, such as relaxing export controls or building data centers, in terms that land well with the current top policymakers. It seems like talking about Biden's diffusion rule as overly burdensome for companies — and therefore bad for national security — worked.When the rubber meets the road, however, AI and chip companies may not like the Trump administration's hawkish position on China, and the administration may not like companies' true views on national security issues. Whatever replaces the AI diffusion rule will expose those critical tensions.These commercial AI and national security concerns have been brewing under the surface for months. In 2024, many AI companies were trying to present themselves as moving in lockstep with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China. But the Biden administration's domestic work on trustworthy AI certainly caused friction with industry — particularly for those who would rather do away with safeguards. And some began whittling away at the national security narrative.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in July 2024 that closing off U.S. AI systems to China would be a mistake, as America's advantage comes from openness and fewer controls. Framed in the context of helping national security, the anti-regulatory argument spoke to a bigger policy concern: China. OpenAI, shortly thereafter, pitched the administration on a massive data center buildout, likewise framed as key to geopolitical competition. This kind of rhetoric, speaking to fears of ""falling behind"" in what many reductively call the ""AI race,"" also found a receptive audience in Washington. Biden started to put his executive order on data centers in motion.The apparent alignment between the government and commercial chip and AI firms changed with the flick of a pen. When the Biden team published the AI diffusion rule on Jan. 13, the backlash was swift from companies that were, a moment ago, speaking as if they backed the president's national security rationale.Nvidia released a statement that day calling the rule a misguided, unprecedented effort that ""threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide"" and ""squander America's hard-won technological advantage."" The rule is ""cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, "" but ""would do nothing to enhance U.S. security.""That rhetoric evidently worked on the new administration — and the benefits shortly flowed to investors. The day after Trump nixed the diffusion rule, Nvidia's stock rose 4.4%. AMD's stock rose 3.4%. But ditching Biden's order is a temporary resolve between these commercial and national security tensions, likely to be disrupted when the Trump administration rolls out the rule's replacement.A replacement program could relax chip and AI model technology exports to some countries favored by Trump, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and hugely ramp up limits for China. That will prompt industry concerns for chip companies wanting to sell in China and to maintain certain China-based supply chain points. Or a new program could soften restrictions below a certain compute or model performance threshold, but broadly curb exports of higher-end technologies in ways that impact a different vertical of industry sales.As a general rule, export restrictions focused on national security are going to both limit companies' overseas market opportunities and speak to issues that aren't companies' bread and butter. Just as some investment firms are skeptical of inbound and outbound investment screening, some leading chip and AI companies are unlikely to truly buy into the scope and degree of national security concerns about exports to China.So administration officials — particularly those most hawkish on Beijing — may find themselves in direct confrontation with chip and AI companies that are keen on continuing to sell high-end chips to Chinese buyers. The administration's concerns about AI diffusion to China through third countries may also conflict with companies that feel even countries with close ties to China aren't in fact China — and therefore aren't a risk. Officials could even encounter the same amount of pushback and criticism on a more relaxed export rule than the Biden administration faced on its more sweeping one. After all, the psychological treadmill kicks in, and even a more moderate set of rules will still raise the regulatory floor — and demand higher compliance costs and impact bottom lines.This isn't to say every chip and AI company is crying ""national security"" just to get on policymakers' calendars. Plenty of chip and AI companies build tech entirely or primarily for national security use cases. Some major AI vendors, such as Anthropic, supported the AI diffusion rule with tweaks. Last month, Anthropic said stronger export controls on chips were necessary to keep a competitive lead over China.It is healthy for commercial enterprises to have a range of views on geopolitical and national security issues, especially in a volatile global trade and geopolitical environment.But as the administration talks genuinely about the country's AI advantage over China, these tensions under the surface will bubble up again. Companies will have to navigate more uncertainty and new national security guidelines. And policymakers may have to confront public-private differences of opinion on China head-on.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Bull of the Day: TaskUs (TASK),1747728000000,"Providing outsourced digital services, TaskUs TASK is an up-and-coming tech company that investors should consider right now.Most appealing, TaskUs stock is trading under $20 a share, and the company’s diversification makes it a very appealing investment as it relates to the rapid expansion of the outsourced digital services market.TaskUs serves the crypto, social media, e-commerce, gaming, food delivery, and ride sharing industries, among others, with some of its most notable clients being Coinbase COIN, Meta Platforms META, DoorDash DASH, and Uber UBER.Outsourced Digital Services OverviewAs a brief overview, outsourced digital services refer to the practice of hiring external experts or companies to manage and implement digital products or services most commonly including IT support and cloud computing, software development, digital marketing, customer service, and data analytics. As for TaskUs, its digital outsourcing specialties include AI-powered customer support and content moderation. Furthermore, in the grand scheme of things, the global IT services outsourcing market was valued at over $700 billion in 2024 and is expected to be worth upwards of $1 trillion by 2030, with a projected CAGR of more than 8% during this period. This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic showed the prolific need for digital content in particular, leading to increased demand for outsourcing these specific services. Image Source: Grand View ResearchTaskUs Accelerates Agentic AI Services Going back to its diversity and expansion, TaskUs recently announced a strategic partnership with AI-driven customer support companies Decagon and Regal last Tuesday. The partnerships augment TaskUs' agentic AI consulting practice, a set of business services and expertise that help companies seamlessly integrate advanced AI technologies into their customer experience operations.To that point, agentic AI can accomplish complex tasks autonomously with minimal human interaction, unlike traditional AI models, as it builds on the rapid progress of generative AI by exhibiting goal-driven behavior, adaptability, and reasoning to solve problems dynamically.TaskUs Growth Trajectory Based on Zacks' estimates, TaskUs’ total sales are expected to rise 13% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to increase another 12% in FY26 to $1.26 billion. Plus, annual earnings are expected to be up 7% this year and are projected to spike another 14% in FY26 to $1.57 per share.It’s also noteworthy that FY26 sales projections would represent 163% growth from sales of $478 million during the height of the pandemic in 2020, with TaskUs going public in June of 2021.TaskUs’ Attractive Valuation While many tech stocks with attractive growth potential (especially as it relates to AI) can usually trade at a stretched premium to the broader market, TASK shares are trading at a very reasonable 12X forward earnings multiple. In comparison, TaskUs’ Zacks Computers-IT Services Industry average is at 21.6X forward earnings, with the benchmark S&P 500’s average currently at 22.9X. Notably, TaskUs also trades at less than 2X sales, which can be a rarity for expansive tech companies even in their later stages of corporate life. Bottom Line Considering its concentration on agentic AI, now appears to be an ideal time to buy TaskUs stock with TASK having an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum. More intriguing, TASK has rebounded and soared over +40% in the last two years but still offers a nearly 30% discount from its IPO price of $23.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:624c6f8da094b:0-bull-of-the-day-taskus-task/
Amazon and Tech Stocks Rally. Stay Cautious. — Barrons.com,1747067160000,"By Angela Palumbo and Adam ClarkAmazon.com was leading the Magnificent Seven group of stocks on Monday as markets welcomed a truce on tariffs between the U.S. and China. Tech investors should keep in mind that there's still a long road ahead.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said early Monday that the U.S. and China have agreed to lower reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. Amazon shares were up 7.4% on the news. That outstripped gains for fellow Mag 7 members Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, which gives equal weight to the group of stocks, was up 4.9%.""With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Monday.It isn't hard to see why Amazon could be a beneficiary of a trade deal between the world's two largest economies. Many of the sellers on its e-commerce marketplace source their goods from China, and the reduction in tariffs will mean they can continue to do business.Amazon investors may also be breathing a sigh of relief over the possibility that spending on advertising may continue to be strong. About 30% of Amazon's first-party merchandise is sourced from China, and Chinese advertisers spent around $8 billion on Amazon advertising in 2024, according to Raymond James estimates.In recent weeks, Wall Street has been concerned that Asia-based advertisers were starting to show signs of weakness. The Trump administration removed a commonly used trade loophole called the de minimis exemption that allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs. Chinese companies, known for lower-priced items, may not want to put as much money into advertising if prices increase and consumers stop spending.If tariffs remain lower than threatened, those price increases may not emerge, and spending might not wane.In that scenario, other tech companies would also benefit. Meta and Alphabet both make a lot of money from advertising, and each of those tech giants said on their most recent earnings calls that they were starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back on advertising. Snapchat parent Snap Inc., which makes almost all of its money from ads, withheld financial guidance in April due to economic uncertainty. That stock was up 7.3% on Monday.Before investors get too excited, it is important to remember that the news is all very fresh. It will take some time for advertisers to go back to their pre-tariff strength, and with a temporary trade deal, there is still uncertainty as to what could come next.The semiconductor industry was also performing well on Monday. Nvidia was up 3.7%, On Semiconductor was surging 9.6%, and Texas Instruments was climbing 8.4%. Wall Street was optimistic that the negotiations could lead to an outcome where electronic goods produced in China that use chips weren't taxed by the U.S. as heavily, and supply chains weren't as disrupted.However, there is more to the chip sector that investors should watch. First, the U.S. has imposed export controls on chips as it seeks to become the winner of the AI race. The Trump administration exempted semiconductors and other electronic products from the reciprocal tariffs, opting instead to target chips specifically through sector tariffs in the future.Secretary Bessent signaled those sector tariffs will still come, saying on CNBC on Monday that reciprocal tariffs have nothing to do with industry-specific tariffs for ""strategic necessities"" like semiconductors, steel, and some medicines.While the market rebounds and tech stocks soar, it's important to remember that there is much more that's likely to come in the months ahead.""This is a textbook recovery after the market's waterfall declines. Expect volatility as we approach the 90-day reciprocal tariffs deadline, "" Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote on Monday. She added that Monday's rally ""illustrates why we tell our clients not to trade headlines.""Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com and Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"GOOGL, META, MSFT: 3 Promising AI Giants With Attractive Valuations",1747055280000,"Wall Street’s high-flying northward journey from January 2023 to January 2025 was predominantly supported by an astonishing rally in the technology sector, buoyed by the explosive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI).The AI saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, “The generative AI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022.”Here we have identified three generative AI behemoths — Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Microsoft Corp. MSFT — that look promising in the near term. Alphabet Inc.Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as the key drivers.Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN) cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft’s Azure.GOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software. Vertex usage increased 20 times in 2024, with strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3 and Veo.

Stocks Rise Pre-Bell on US-China Trade Agreement; Investors Await Key Inflation Data,1747049962000,"The benchmark US stock measures were pointing higher before the opening bell on Monday as Washington and Beijing struck a deal to slash tariffs on each other's goods, while investors await key inflation data later in the week. The S&P 500 gained 2.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2%, and the Nasdaq climbed 3.8% in premarket activity. The S&P 500 and the Dow finished Friday's trading session in the red, while the Nasdaq Composite was little changed. The US and China on Monday agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods, effective Wednesday, following talks between officials in Switzerland over the weekend. China will reduce its tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%, while the US will lower duties on Chinese products to 30% from 145%. The new measures are effective for 90 days. ""We had very productive talks,"" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news conference, according to a CNBC report. ""We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause and substantially move down the tariff levels.""Washington and Beijing have been engaged in a trade war after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new reciprocal tariffs on several nations on April 2. Last month, China raised its tariffs on US imports to 125% in response to Trump's move to hike duties on the Asian country's products to 145%. ""This is clearly just the start of a broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush Securities said in a Monday client note. US Treasury yields moved higher in premarket action, with the two-year rate increasing about 12 basis points to 4% and the 10-year rate gaining 7 basis points to 4.45%. With no economic reports scheduled for Monday, traders will be awaiting the consumer price index report for April on Tuesday, followed by the producer price index and the retail sales report for the same month on Thursday. Last week, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged and warned that upside risks to inflation and unemployment have increased. Fed Governor Michael Barr said Friday that the US government's trade tariffs were likely to raise inflation and unemployment, amid an expected economic slowdown.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AI Agents Will Transform Customer Relationships, for Better or Worse — WSJ",1746878400000,"By Steven RosenbushAI agents are poised to make communication between businesses and their customers deeper, more open and more personal. That level of intimacy might be great, but as in any relationship, it creates the potential for hazard, too.The latest generation of AI agents are capable of taking action on behalf of people in a range of functions, including coding , customer service, legal services and booking an appointment with a healthcare provider. Their migration into popular messaging services such as WhatsApp opens up even more opportunities for businesses in the areas of sales, support, marketing and branding.There is a flywheel effect at work here. The AI agent has access to an enormous amount of data about users that makes it possible to tailor recommendations, information, and insights to their needs. And once they reside in a messaging app, they can create a continuing presence in the user's life, just like a person would.""Once an AI knows you and remembers your history, it stops feeling like a tool and starts to feel like a companion,"" says Conor Grennan, chief AI architect at New York University Stern School of Business. ""It starts to blur the line between an AI brand ambassador and just a friend who shares your taste.""But that is also where the potential peril lies. As AI agents become more like people, they are increasingly prone to the pitfalls of human relationships. Last year, for example, Air Canada was ordered to refund a customer after the airline's chatbot gave the wrong details about its bereavement policy. Air Canada said the technology was less sophisticated than more current AI. But it would be rash to assume that today's AI is beyond error.Consumers themselves might not trust an AI agent's answers, and could demand to speak to a human representative the way they do now when they reach automated customer-service phone lines.WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms is betting that combining AI agents and business messaging can provide a new pillar of growth.It has a lot riding on that bet. Meta, which paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014, last month raised its projected companywide capital spending for the year to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, largely on its artificial-intelligence investments.But AI chatbots could help get more businesses using the company's messaging products. It has a number of ways to cash in if they do, including the sale of ads on Instagram or Facebook that let users click to send messages over the regular WhatsApp app that they use everyday.WhatsApp created a specialized app for small businesses and an application programming interface, or API, for large businesses back in 2018, and their usage has been soaring in markets such as India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil, according to Meta's Nikila Srinivasan, vice president of product management for business messaging.Verizon began a WhatsApp campaign for Spanish-speaking customers in the U.S. last fall, according to Robyn Parks, the telecom giant's vice president of segment and local marketing. The campaign uses ads on Facebook or Instagram that give customers or potential customers the option to click to chat on WhatsApp, with an opportunity to move the communication to another channel.The company would typically expect a ""conversation start rate"" for an ad to be in the single digits. The WhatsApp campaign has been in the double digits, she said. Verizon said it also has ads on WhatsApp that direct customers to the Verizon website and app.And if a customer drops out of the conversation, Verizon can use the WhatsApp channel to try to re-engage via WhatsApp text, a process that she described as a ""warm callback."" That wouldn't be possible with advertising in a broadcast medium.""It's much more of a conversation,"" Parks said.Now imagine untold AI agents initiating those warm callbacks. It could be revolutionary — and risky for companies that don't learn to manage those agents with the same care that they manage people.Write to Steven Rosenbush at steven.rosenbush@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250510000577:0/
More Young People are Using Gen AI to Plan Trips — Market Talk,1747672500000,"Even as more users look to ChatGPT, Meta AI and Google's Gemini to research products and shop, relatively few are using the platforms to plan trips, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. Younger cohorts, though, are increasingly turning to the applications for travel planning, with such usage growing at a faster clip than for their older peers in the last six months, the analysts said. Product innovation and improved commercial capabilities, like a Google digital travel agent or similar offering, will likely dictate the pace of adoption from here on out, the analysts say.

The next, you're staring into the abyss, eating glass — as Elon Musk likes to say — watching the disruption at your door.Most, if not all, of the Magnificent Seven are in that position — weirdly trying at the same time to figure out the threat of artificial intelligence to their kingdoms.That dynamic has been on display the past few weeks: Alphabet's stock dropped more than 7% Wednesday after a senior Apple executive disclosed that Google search-traffic on its devices using Safari fell for the first time in 20 years. (Google later clarified it continues to see overall search growth, even from Apple devices.)For his part, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook is trying to buy time for his company, pushing investors during his latest earnings call to be patient with the iPhone maker's delays around AI features.Then there is Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to paint a bright future for his ad-dollar juggernaut as something of an AI-buddy for the lonely.Even Musk seems to be sweating things as he returns from his DOGE sojourn to Tesla, seeking to counter a slide in the electric carmaker's stock price with promises of deploying driverless cars. ""We're not on edge of death — not even close,"" Musk told analysts recently.His protests sounded like that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" character about to be thrown on a pile of corpses: ""I'm not dead! ... I feel happy!""To be fair, none of these giants are dead — yet. And they have lots of reasons to feel happy — they are wildly profitable pillars of corporate America and together represent around $7 trillion of market value.Yet the crossroads they all stand at, collectively, and how they react, individually, look like ready-made case studies for a 21st century update of the classic business school book ""The Innovator's Dilemma.""Author Clayton Christensen tried to explain how new products or services displace existing players by creating new markets. It was a book that made the term ""disruption"" wildly popular in boardrooms — even if used in a way the late Christensen didn't always intend.The gist of his theory was that successful companies doing everything seemingly right can fail when smaller companies — not constrained by what has been — rise up, often with new technologies or processes. Think Netflix targeting through-the-mail subscribers versus Blockbuster's in-store model.Many turned to this book to explain the dot-com boom that helped usher in the current crop of Silicon Valley heroes. There are rough parallels today.Just as the internet was a new technology that could do lots of things, AI holds many promises. But in these early innings, it isn't clear how AI will be deployed — or by whom or when.Pets.com, for example, wasn't the winner many thought. That's the rub. Even Christensen had a hard time predicting disrupters, like Apple's iPhone.When the gadget came out in 2007, the Harvard professor didn't see it as a threat to phones. In fact, the device ushered in a new era of mobile computing and the App Economy.That app marketplace, however, might look a lot different if companies are reaching customers in different ways . AI agents, for example, could upend the App Store way of the world.So far, Apple's answer to AI has appeared to be heavy on the hype. ""We just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar,"" Cook told investors during Apple's recent earnings call about the delay.At least Google has an AI assistant, Gemini, though it's unclear if that chatbot will be enough to save its real business — advertising, which accounted for most of its revenue last year. That's a lot of ads sold off users clicking on links in a world where people increasingly ask a chatbot their questions, like: What is ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" about?Still, it might be surprising that no dominant platform seems to have a winning formula just yet.That gives hope to the likes of Sarah Guo, a young venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. She is trying to make her mark by investing in the next hot AI startup that might dethrone the big dogs.""There are many claims you can make strategically about why a company shouldn't exist: because Microsoft should build it or Apple should build or Google should build it,"" she told me during the recent episode of the "" Bold Names"" podcast. But, often for these established companies, she said, it can be hard ""being creative with a risky new product.""Just ask Google. The early days of Gemini were marred by apologies and promises to do better after its chat responses were seen as biased and — according to CEO Sundar Pichai — unacceptable. The rollout occurred amid concerns that startup OpenAI was ahead in the space, even though Google had been working on AI for a long while.""No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry's development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes,"" Pichai wrote at the time.Sometimes big breakthrough innovations, which we want to call disruptive, in fact help sustain existing businesses.Microsoft — with a market value that has again surpassed Apple — is looking pretty savvy having embraced AI for its workplace products. Nvidia, too, has been a big beneficiary of AI companies gobbling up its high-price chips needed for developing their models.Yet the emergence of China's DeepSeek and other new AI models that supposedly use far less pricey computing power raise new questions. It remains unclear where the value of the new technology will land.It's all such a dilemma. At least, nobody is dead — yet.Write to Tim Higgins at tim.higgins@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250510000497:0/
"ChatGPT Sees Weaker Momentum Among Older Users than Meta AI, Gemini — Market Talk",1747670280000,"As generative AI adoption continues to ramp up, ChatGPT is still the top pick for teens and young adults, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. But for 25-34 year olds, there appears to be greater variety, with adoption roughly the same across ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta AI, the analysts said. Meanwhile for older age groups, ChatGPT usage is largely flat in the last six months, while its competitors have notched gains, they said. Gemini has shown the strongest momentum overall, garnering the biggest daily and monthly active user gains, they said.

META: Meta Stock Can’t Rebound for Days After News Native ‘Behemoth’ AI Model Is Delayed,1747641865000,"Is Zuckerberg in trouble or is that another opportunity to buy the dip in big tech? According to WSJ, Meta’s engineers can’t come up with anything impressive for the launch of Behemoth. 📢 Meta Stock Can’t Catch a Break- Meta stock NASDAQ:META can’t shake off the selling pressure after it was slammed by investors on Thursday when a bad report came out. A Wall Street Journal story revealed internal struggles over the company’s flagship “Behemoth” AI model. - Shares of Meta dropped 0.6% on Friday, extending their Thursday loss of 2.4% when the news broke out. - Touted as the company’s jewel of Meta’s AI crown, the “Behemoth” project is now getting delayed. An April release got pushed back to May and the May release is now pushed back to fall or later. 🔥 Internal Troubles Loom- Engineers at the big tech giants, the WSJ said, can’t figure out how to make the model better so they’ve decided it’s not worthy of a push live just yet. What’s worse, and maybe more concerning, is that 11 of the 14 researchers who built the OG Llama model have bailed and are no longer with the Facebook owner. - Meta’s AI initiatives have been supporting the stock’s upside swing for months (if not a couple years already). In its latest earnings report, Zuckerberg’s tech titan raised its capital expenditures (capex) for 2025 to $72 billion from $60 billion , focusing the lion’s share of that pile of cash on AI gigs. 🔑 Meta’s Stock Performance- While the stock has been in a mild selloff mode, some money spinners have switched on their buy-the-dip mode. Loop Capital, for one, slapped a bullish price target on Meta stock Friday, predicting a 40% upside to $888 per share from the current $640 a pop. - Year to date, Meta stock has been doing much like the rest of the Magnificent Seven club — not too great. Shares of the company just recently turned positive, boasting a roughly 7% increase since trading kicked off for 2025.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:8e7c40fdd094b:0-meta-meta-stock-can-t-rebound-for-days-after-news-native-behemoth-ai-model-is-delayed/
Pinterest Shows Strength in Uncertain Advertising Market — Barrons.com,1746808860000,"By Angela PalumboPinterest stock was climbing after the photo sharing platform gave better-than-expected revenue guidance despite continued uncertainty in advertising.Pinterest reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $855 million. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 26 cents a share on revenue of $846.5 million.Despite the mixed results, shares were up 5.8% in afternoon trading on Friday to $29.52.Pinterest management said on its earnings call that it expects second-quarter revenue to be between $960 million and $980 million. That is above Wall Street expectations of $958.2 million.Pinterest's strong revenue guidance is a standout since — according to the company's latest 10-K filing — it makes a substantial amount of its revenue from advertising. Other companies that rely on advertising have warned that ad spending, specifically from Asia-based companies, is showing signs of weakness.This comes after the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed low-cost items to come into the U.S. without being exposed to tariffs.Asia-based companies spend a lot on advertising their inexpensive products, and if customers shop those products less as they increase in price, advertisers may pull back spending.Fellow social media company Snap also makes a lot of money from advertising, but withheld second-quarter guidance ""given the uncertainty with respect to how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead."" Meta Platforms and Alphabet also noted during their latest earnings conference calls that they are seeing weakness with Asia-based advertiser spending.Pinterest CFO Julia Donnelly said on the earnings call that the company has seen a reduction in ""spend from Asia-based e-commerce retailers in the U.S. given the change in the de minimis exemption.""""However, we've also seen a geographic diversification from some of those Asia-based retailers to our European and Rest of World user regions. And that's a theme that has continued to play out over multiple quarters now and continues today,"" Donnelly added.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/
Why Nearly 20 Analysts Raised Meta Price Targets Post-Earnings,1746802020000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META rewarded investors with another strong post-earnings gain on May 1 . Shares rose over 4% after the release , and the company’s results extended its streak of beating expectations. Meta has now beaten Wall Street's sales estimates for 11 straight quarters . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] It also exceeded expectations for  adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the ninth quarter in a row . Overall, shares have gained by an average of more than 5% post-earnings over the last 10 quarters .However, a higher share price was far from the only good news investors received. According to forecasts tracked by MarketBeat, nearly 20 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the tech giant. To be fair, several individuals lowered their targets. Still, three times as many boosted them.So, what is driving the majority of analysts to become more bullish on Meta , and exactly how much upside do they see?JPMorgan Sees Good Reason for Meta’s Increased CapExOne major announcement coming from Meta was the company raising its capital expenditure (CapEx) guidance for 2025. Meta has been using CapEx spending to invest significantly in AI infrastructure that supports the growth of its business. Critics have targeted big tech companies for their tens of billions in CapEx spending on AI. However, Meta has been demonstrating extensive gains due to the implementation of AI in its advertising platform. Wall Street analysts are noticing this and showing support for Meta’s higher CapEx spending plans. The success of Meta’s AI initiatives is a key reason many are raising their price targets.Even though more CapEx spending means more cash leaving Meta’s pockets, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE:JPM expressed confidence in this move. They highlighted the company’s “solid results and execution along its AI roadmap” and its “ambitious long-term goals” as justifications for the higher spending.Analysts at Stifel noted Meta’s ongoing investment in artificial intelligence as a key driver of future growth. Piper Sandler believes that Meta’s AI initiatives are “a key factor in the company’s forward momentum."" They stated that the higher CapEx spending aims to fast-track the development and rollout of the technology needed for these initiatives. Truist Securities added that “Meta continues to justify its right to invest.""The fact that people are seeing more ads on Meta and that marketers are spending more on each ad provides evidence of Meta’s strong AI execution. From Q1 2023 to Q1 2025, the number of ad impressions on Meta’s apps is up by around 26% , indicating that marketers are buying a higher volume of ads. Comparing the same two periods, the price paid per ad is up around 17% . In economics, higher prices typically mean that demand should fall. The fact that Meta is raising its ad prices while also seeing higher ad demand demonstrates the huge value that marketers are getting out of its platform. Meta’s AI investments have led to significantly more time spent on its apps. This is a key reason why marketers are willing to direct more ads to them while also paying a higher price .Citi Sees Added AI Clarity as a Positive [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C brought up another key point. Meta laid out the five major growth opportunities it is pursuing through its AI strategy. This was the first time that Meta explained this in a structured format. Those opportunities are: “improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.""Analysts at Citi noted that this clear plan “strengthened confidence in [Meta’s] continued growth trajectory."" Although this may not seem like a big deal, companies often get rewarded for providing clarity around their business .Doing so allows investors to understand how well a company is actually executing. If a company executes well, this can lead to higher multiples. Because Meta is doing just that, adding clarity is a positive. However, it could also backfire if Meta stops executing well.Updated Targets Indicate Nearly 20% Upside in MetaOn average, Wall Street analyst price target updates tracked by MarketBeat after the May 1 earnings release indicate significant 12-month return potential in Meta shares. Compared to the stock’s May 8 closing price of just under $598 per share , these updates imply that shares could rise by over 18%.Overall, the rise in price targets for Meta comes down to one key point: the company is delivering strong results with its AI strategy . This should bolster investor confidence , just as it has done for many on Wall Street.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:ef2d0e56c094b:0-why-nearly-20-analysts-raised-meta-price-targets-post-earnings/
Senate Is Set to Pass a Stablecoin Bill. Rules for Crypto Exchanges Will Be Harder. — Barrons.com,1747433880000,"By Joe LightThe crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.As soon as Monday, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets like Treasury bills. Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and to give coin holders priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy.Stablecoins underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Rather than pay cash for a token, traders typically use stablecoins, which together have a market value of about $250 billion. The largest such token, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global.While stablecoins are currently used primarily for trading, issuers believe they could soon be a serious challenger to traditional payments networks. Their expectation is that they could also save consumers billions of dollars in fees on remittances and other expensive cross-border transactions.The bill requires 60 votes to move through the Senate, and earlier this month, it appeared the GENIUS Act would sail through with bipartisan support. Even though some Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), have been skeptical of the crypto industry push, many other lawmakers have warmed to the industry. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions and lobbying.The bill's recent troubles have hinged on two major issues. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. A second issue is President Donald Trump's business arrangements with the industry.A revised draft of the bill appears to throw up a roadblock to tech companies issuing stablecoins by requiring nonfinancial public companies to get special approval from a committee. However, the new bill doesn't address concerns that Trump and his family could directly profit from the tokens through its majority ownership of crypto firm World Liberty Financial, which has issued a stablecoin called USD1.A memo, titled ""Negotiations Win Summary,"" circulated among Democratic senators earlier this week, touting ""major victories"" won since early May, including the new Big Tech language. However, it remains to be seen whether the changes will be enough to ensure passage. The bill is expected to have an easier time in the House of Representatives, which won't require a supermajority for approval.A bigger problem for the crypto industry is what the stablecoin bill's troubles could mean for a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and the thousands of issuers of crypto tokens. During former President Joe Biden's administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase — as well as other exchanges and token issuers — for allegedly violating securities laws, charges that Coinbase denied.Trump's SEC promptly dismissed those cases with prejudice, meaning the same cases can't be brought back later. But there is a fear that a future administration could come back with similar allegations if a new law governing crypto market structure doesn't make clear what does and doesn't fall under the SEC's remit.""After this, getting market structure is even more important,"" said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on a conference panel this week with Gillibrand and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.).How to police crypto exchanges and issuers is a more controversial issue than stablecoins, even within the industry itself. Among the issues are how to decide when a token is sufficiently ""decentralized"" for it not to be subject to securities laws.Apart from the stablecoin venture, Trump or his family own or have ties to a Bitcoin mining firm, several ""meme"" coins and so-called nonfungible tokens, and a venture to launch crypto exchange-traded funds, giving many more reasons for Democrats to blanch at the swift passage of a comprehensive crypto bill.It took several near-death experiences for lawmakers potentially to squeak through stablecoin legislation. That might prove to have been the easy part.Write to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%. Appaloosa might have taken profits in the latter and not see a turnaround coming for the former. Or it may have liked other opportunities better.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Stock Rises. Even Hedge Fund Sales Can't Keep It Down. — Barrons.com,1747426500000,"Al RootTesla stock rose Friday to close out another incredible week with a gain as investors bet that Tesla's investments in self-driving cars are about to bear fruit.Suddenly, the troubled automaker no longer looks troubled.Shares of Tesla added 2.1%, closing at $349.98, while the S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%.The rise comes despite quarterly disclosures showing Daniel Loeb's Third Point Investors exited a 500,000-share Tesla stake during the March quarter. It also exited a 670,000-share Meta Platforms stake while buying 1.45 million shares of Nvidia, among other shifts.Investors like to follow what large, successful fund managers are doing, but changes don't always move stocks significantly. What's more, the filing reflects holdings as of the end of March, meaning portfolios could have shifted again since then.Tesla shares rose 17.3% for the week, a fourth consecutive weekly gain. The streak started with an 18% jump the week Tesla reported first-quarter earnings. Numbers were weaker than expected but the company stuck to its timelines for a lower-priced model and for a robotaxi service. The latter is due to start in Austin, Texas, in June.Easing trade tensions between China and the U.S., which boosted most shares, also helped, pointed out Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster in a recent tweet.""Ride-hailing is a massive opportunity,"" he wrote. ""This year in the U.S., Uber and Lyft are expected to generate about $90 billion in gross bookings across roughly four billion rides ... Tesla is projected to generate approximately $100 billion in total revenue this year.

Meta's 5 Key Pillars for AI Growth—Zuckerberg's Bold Vision,1747420380000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] In its last earnings call, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META made a concerted effort to add more transparency around its AI strategy .Mark Zuckerberg laid out the “ five major opportunities ” the company is pursuing through its AI investments. Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C called this out as a significant positive .Understanding these opportunities is crucial to assessing whether the tech giant is living up to expectations going forward.How effectively Meta capitalizes on them will likely influence both investor confidence and the company’s long-term growth trajectory.Opportunities for the Here and Now: Advertising & App ExperiencesThe first opportunity is “ improved advertising ."" This is what Meta has already been doing and generating its great financial results from. The company essentially wants to make it as easy as possible for businesses to get customers.Meta’s technology is learning how to show the right ad to the right person at the right time . As it gets better, advertisers are paying more money per ad , demonstrating the value they are receiving. The company’s AI ad creation tools also saw 30% more usage last quarter. This shows that the tools are likely making it easier for marketers to create ads.The second opportunity is “more engaging experiences."" Essentially, Meta wants to increase the amount of time spent and the level of interaction with content on its apps. This would raise the value of advertising on Meta as users focus more on its apps than on other platforms. The company shares that  improvements to its content recommendation systems have led to a 6% to 35% increase in time spent on its various apps.Facebook started as a place where people shared mostly through written posts. However, image—and video-based content are far more engaging. Zuckerberg sees content progressing even further. People and the content they are watching will interact back and forth with each other in real time. He believes AI will be key in enabling the creation of this type of content. Seeing tangible examples of creators producing this type of content and successfully increasing engagement will be vital.Emerging Opportunities: Messaging Monetization, Meta AI, AI GlassesThe next opportunity is “business messaging.""   Billions of users and messages are sent across Meta’s WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram apps. However, messaging on these platforms is largely unmonetized at this point. Zuckerberg sees a future where companies generate sales through direct messaging customers. Companies in Thailand and Vietnam already do this extensively.However, they use human employees because the labor cost in these countries is low. Companies can use AI agents to message people to make this profitable in developed countries. This could create a large monetization opportunity for Meta. Continued user growth is important as investors await more details on this front. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] The fourth opportunity is Meta AI . This AI assistant was built into Meta’s apps and is now available as a standalone app . Meta AI now has almost 1 billion monthly active users. Ultimately, Zuckerberg wants to increase engagement as people talk to Meta AI and discover more content that interests them.This can lead to opportunities to show personalized product recommendations . He also anticipates a premium service , presumably some type of subscription. He says it will continue growing the platform for at least a year before thinking about revenue generation. As with business messaging, increased users and engagement will be important to see going forward.The final opportunity Zuckerberg outlined was “AI devices."" Specifically, he mentioned that glasses are the “ideal form factor” for AI and the metaverse. Zuckerberg believes that over the next five to ten years, many of the more than 1 billion people who wear glasses today will switch to AI glasses.He mentioned that sales of the company’s Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses tripled in the past year. It will be important to pay attention to seeing sales grow in this area and to see significant improvements in the technology.What This All Means for InvestorsNow that Meta has laid out this  AI framework , evaluating the company’s performance becomes easier.Investors should stay keenly aware of different metrics and commentary that indicate how well Meta is performing in each of these areas. When it comes to the emerging opportunities, investors also shouldn’t panic if results stagnate.Zuckerberg notes that the company does not need to succeed in all these areas to succeed overall. Zuckerberg gave markets a  clear score sheet to judge the company's performance with. Now, it's up to Meta to execute.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:a7e411511094b:0-meta-s-5-key-pillars-for-ai-growth-zuckerberg-s-bold-vision/
The Next Generation of AI Remains Elusive. All That CapEx Has Yet to Pay Off. — Barrons.com,1747414500000,"By Adam LevineOn Thursday The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platform's largest and most ambitious AI language model, Llama 4 Behemoth, would be delayed for the second time. Meta stock fell on the news, finishing Thursday down 2.4%.In delaying its next generation of language models, Meta has good company in AI start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic.OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 came out in November 2022 and shocked the world with its capabilities; it was the spark that set the AI world ablaze. Just a few months later, it released the much larger GPT-4, a big leap in capabilities.Observers projected this rate of progress into the future, leading to bold predictions of superintelligent computers within just a few years.But it's been two years since GPT-4's release, and GPT-5 is nowhere to be found. Anthropic announced a new Claude model, Opus, last June. It, too, isn't ready.Meta's Behemoth is set to be by far the largest AI model Meta has produced, and it looks like it is running into the same walls that OpenAI and Anthropic hit. The report from the Wall Street Journal said that Meta staffers were questioning ""whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release.""A Meta spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The company didn't respond to a request for comment from Barron's.With new large-language models bumping into technical roadblocks, the AI model makers have had to find other ways to make their chatbots perform better. New ""reasoning"" models, like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek r1, have long internal dialogues with themselves and work through problems step-by-step, checking itself as it goes along. They work well, but they're very slow.For example, Barron's asked OpenAI o3, ""Explain how much Meta is spending on AI data centers, and how much their pre-training runs for Llama 4 Behemoth cost."" o3 spent over four minutes talking to itself before spitting about a thousand-word answer. Meanwhile, all that ""thinking"" costs money; for developers, o3 is five times more expensive than OpenAI's best non-reasoning model.New, larger models offer the hope of an o3-type response, without four minutes of thinking.The disappointment from Meta investors on Thursday is compounded by the massive amounts of money the company is spending to make a new model happen. After spending $14 billion in capital expenditures in the first quarter, Meta projected it would spend another $50 billion to $58 billion on AI data centers in the remaining nine months of 2025. Training runs to create these very large models are expensive; Meta's research and development costs for the first quarter were up by 22% from the year before.Investors are still wondering when the payoff for all this investment comes. Advertising is the likely path for Meta to monetize AI, given that 98% of its total 2024 revenue came from advertising.But it's not on the near horizon. ""Our initial focus for Meta AI is really about building a great consumer experience, and that's frankly where all of our energies are kind of directed to right now,"" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Meta's fourth quarter earnings call. ""There will, I think, be pretty clear monetization opportunities here over time.""More recently, CEO Mark Zuckerberg sounded optimistic about Meta's return on investment when it comes to AI spending. After laying out a range of monetization possibilities, he said, ""We don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.""Shares of Meta were down 1.4% in mid-day trading on Friday.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump Makes a Deal With the U.K. Now Comes the Hard Part. — Barrons.com,1746721080000,"By Joe Light, Reshma Kapadia, Brian Swint, and George GloverPresident Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday announced a trade deal with the U.K., the first since April. Despite a strong market reaction to the news, the details don't signal the start of substantial relief on tariffs.The deal will increase imports of U.S. agricultural products like ethanol, beef, and machinery, said Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a press conference. It will lower U.S. tariffs on some steel and auto imports from the U.K., Lutnick said. Importantly, it will leave in place the 10% ""baseline"" tariff that the U.S. unveiled in April.Trump said the 10% baseline tariff is as low as the U.K. and other countries will see.Also, Lutnick announced that a U.K. company also agreed to buy $10 billion worth of airplanes from Boeing.""It's so good for both countries,"" Trump said, who added that the details will be finalized in ""coming weeks."" Trump has called the deal ""a full and comprehensive"" arrangement with the U.K. that will be the ""first of many.""The stock market extended its rally after the press conference. As of midday Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 1.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4%. Trump said he expected the market ""to really rally"" with the U.K. announcement, at one point advising investors they ""better go out and buy stocks now.""Trump said he was ""very close"" to striking more trade deals and pushed back on the idea that the U.K. deal was announced prematurely before many details had been hammered out.In a TruthSocial post, Trump said that the agreement will increase exports to the U.K. by $5 billion, while increasing market access for cereals, fruits, vegetables, soft drinks and chemicals, among other products. The post said that up to 100,000 of U.K. car imports would be subject to the 10% baseline tariff, as opposed to the increased tariffs on autos.Trump Says Talks With China Will Be Very SubstantiveThe U.K. deal comes just before talks with one of the U.S.'s biggest trade partners are set to begin.Trump said talks with China this weekend will be ""very substantive."" When asked if tariffs on the country could come down, he said they ""can't get any higher.""Many analysts have expected this weekend's meeting between U.S. officials and China to be more of an icebreaker. But Trump said: ""China wants to do something.""Trump also indicated that he might speak with Xi after the talks and that he might also be willing to reduce tariffs after the talks. A lot is riding on these talks, which could thaw the escalation between the two countries that has brought trade to almost a halt. Tariffs on Chinese imports are at 145% and Chinese imports on U.S. goods are at 125%.Trump also stressed he wants China to open up its markets to the U.S., and that would be among the topics Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would bring up at this weekend's talks. ""It would be great for friendship. People think I'm a militant guy. I'm not. Trade can bring greater friendship with China."" That runs counter to the growing concerns of a decoupling between the U.S. and China, fueled by some of the more hawkish members of the administration.The U.K. deal could fuel Chinese officials' fear that Trump keeps renegotiating deals even after one is struck. Peter Mandelson, U.K. Ambassador to the U.S., noted Trump's ""11th hour intervention"" phone call where he demanded ""even more out of this deal than we anticipated.""While both sides heralded the deal, details have yet to be ironed out. Trump said that, ""Over time, there will be adjustments made because we are flexible and think we could do better.""Trump Says U.K. Trade Deal Is First of Many. It Will Only Get Harder.The hope is that this is the start of a streak of bilateral agreements that will substantially bring down overall tariff levels before Trump's ""Liberation Day"" taxes take effect July 8. But there are good reasons the U.K. deal was the quickest and easiest to complete, and it doesn't necessarily guide the way for others.For one, the stakes are relatively low. Trump views trade deficits as damaging to the U.S., but America actually ran a surplus with Britain in the fourth quarter. To be sure, that was the first time that had happened since 2011, excluding the volatile quarters of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it shows that the U.K. sells only about as much to the U.S. as it buys.If Trump wants to get trade deficits down, a deal with the the U.K. won't make a big dent.Beyond that, the U.K. is only the fifth-biggest buyer of U.S. exports, behind Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. And that doesn't account for the European Union, which represents 20 countries including Germany and France and which will be negotiating as a bloc.Second, the U.K. has some low-hanging fruit to offer as concessions. Besides easing restrictions on food and agricultural imports from the U.S., Britain also imposes a 2% tax on revenues of search engines, social media, and online markets that make money from U.K. users. That hits Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Google parent Alphabet.The details of the U.K. deal have yet to be announced, but it isn't obvious what other countries with trade surpluses with the U.S., such as China, India, and Vietnam, can put on the table.To be sure, Thursday's news is good news, especially for the British car, aerospace and pharmaceutical companies that export a lot to the U.S., such as Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, and AstraZeneca. Spirits maker Diageo, the owner of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Tanqueray gin, must also be breathing a sigh of relief.It's also a sign that deals are possible. But the real relief won't come until the Trump administration reaches agreements with even bigger trade partners.Maersk Cuts Container Market OutlookA.P. Moeller-Maersk stood by its full-year earnings guidance Thursday, but warned that trade tensions could hit global container market volumes.The Danish shipping giant still expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between $6 billion and $9 billion in 2025, but is now forecasting global container volume growth of between a 1% fall and a 4% rise. It had previously expected an expansion of 4%.""With trade tensions flaring up and uncertainty on the rise, global supply chains are once again in the spotlight,"" CEO Vincent Clerc said.The company's results are typically seen as a bellwether for global trade, so its gloomy forecast on volumes will do nothing to ease fears that ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China will weigh on demand. Maersk shares slid 1.4% in early trading.Toyota Warns Tariffs Will Dent ProfitToyota said that its annual profit will plunge on Thursday, warning that U.S. tariffs could dent its bottom line.The Japanese car maker's quarterly earnings topped analysts' forecasts, but it now expects its profit for the current fiscal year to tumble 35% to 3.1 trillion yen ($21.4 billion). It said the impact of Trump's levies in April and May had ""been tentatively factored in"" to its forecast for now. Toyota's American depositary receipts dropped 2.2% in early trading.Trump on Thursday lambasted Mattel and other companies that have said they plan to raise prices in response to tariffs or that have threatened to go to other countries. ""Let them go and we'll put 100% of tariffs on his toys and they won't sell one toy in the United States,"" said Trump, arguing that companies and countries can pick up the cost of tariffs rather than consumers.Tariffs Keep Fed on HoldWednesday's press conference following the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision confirmed that tariffs are the greatest unknown for policymakers. Chair Jerome Powell and colleagues kept rates on hold and said they're waiting before making the next move.For now, the economy is strong enough to give the Fed time. Markets are pricing in an 80% chance for another decision for unchanged rates in June and a 55% chance of a quarter-point cut in July.At Thursday's deal announcement, Trump continued to rail on Powell for not cutting rates, arguing that it would be like ""jet fuel"" if the Fed lowered rates and saying that Powell was always ""too late"" in interest-rate decisions.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?,1747413720000,"Income-hungry investors have been piling into ETFs that use options to deliver juicy dividends. We've seen a surge in launches of these products recently, as providers employ innovative strategies to package derivatives within the ETF structure to meet rising investor demand.In addition to offering high yields, these strategies generally help reduce portfolio volatility. However, investors should remember that there’s no free lunch in investing. These products tend to perform best in sideways markets and often underperform during strong bull runs. That said, they can provide some downside protection when stocks fall.Quantitative Researcher Roni Israelov refers to these strategies as a “Devil’s Bargain.” His research shows that trading options to generate income can undermine long-term investment returns.This paper is Roni’s personal research and not a work product of Citadel.Our own analysis of the most popular derivatives-backed ETFs also suggests that investors may be leaving significant returns on the table in their pursuit of high income. Nevertheless, these products have attracted substantial inflows this year, as market volatility has shaken investor confidence.The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses proprietary research to select around 130 stocks and writes S&P 500 Index call options to generate income. Its top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META.JEPI and its sister fund, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, are among the top asset gatherers this year.The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO aims to deliver high income from both dividends and covered calls. Its managers focus on high-quality large-cap companies with a history of dividend growth and write covered calls on individual stocks.While DIVO has outperformed JEPI, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term on a total return basis.JEPQ and the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD continue to underperform the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d14073830094b:0-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-options-income-etfs/

The controls were set to take effect later this month.Chipmakers led the rally, with Intel jumping 3.3 percent, AMD rising over 3 percent, and Nvidia edging up 0.5 percent. Among megacaps, Meta and Amazon gained more than 1 percent, while Tesla surged more than 3 percent.In the previous session, Wall Street ended with gains, after a volatile session, marked by sharp swings from gains to losses. The volatility was sparked by Trump saying he wouldn't preemptively cut the tariff levied on China, amid the ongoing negotiations.

Why this investment bank sees more than 30% upside on Meta,1747400441000,"Investment banking firm Loop Capital maintained its bullish stance on Meta platforms with a target price of $888.This indicates a 38% upside from Thursday’s closing price.AI performance Loop Capital’s analysts said that Facebook’s parent company’s artificial intelligence-driven performance has made up for the drop in spending from Chinese advertisers. “We continue to see Meta as the best non-hardware example of tangible, right-now beneficiary of AI and think the stock will outperform the ‘mag-7’ peer group this year,” Loop Capital Analyst Rob Sanderson said. The analyst said the stock will be a beneficiary of non-hardware example of being a beneficiary of AI.The company increased its capital expenditure outlook for 2025 to invest more in data centres for AI. Meta plans to invest $72 billion in capital expenditure this year. While the analyst noted that current core AI investments are constrained by capacity, new data centre AI capacity is coming online. A behemoth concernThis positive note comes after a Wall Street Journal report said that Meta is delaying the rollout of its “Behemoth” large language model. The Behemoth model was first slated to come out in April 2025 but was later pushed to June and now to fall or later, the report said. According to the report, Meta’s engineers were concerned that Behemoth’s performance couldn’t match what the company’s public statements. Meta had touted that Behemoth outperformed similar AI models of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic in some tests. After the report came, Meta’s stock fell over 2% on Thursday. FTC monopoly caseMeta recently asked a federal judge to drop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) case against the company. The company argued that the FTC failed to prove the antitrust case. FTC had accused Meta of dominating the social media market by buying out rival companies such as Instagram and WhatsApp to buy out the competition.The trial started in April, and the FTC is trying to show Meta was trying to buy out the competition a decade ago by pointing out emails of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg worrying about Instagram and WhatsApp’s growth. If the judge doesn’t drop the case, the trial may run into June as Meta is now presenting its own evidence against the charges. Meta stock continues to shineMeta stock has gained over 7% in the year so far, emerging as the second-best-performing stock among the magnificent seven cohort of stocks in that period. Microsoft is the best performing stock with a 8% gain and Apple has been the worst performing among the group with a 13% decline. Meta’s shares had gained over 28% in the last month as investors cheered strong Q1 results. The company had posted a 16% increase in revenue to $42.31 billion against an expected $41.40 billion. Its net income surged 35% to $16.64 billion.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:9ce1d334c094b:0-why-this-investment-bank-sees-more-than-30-upside-on-meta/

While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +6.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter last month, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have also declined since the quarter got underway.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.8% in Q2 on +9.9% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed in recent days.In last week's report, regular readers saw this reversal in the Tech sector's revisions trend when we shared the evolution of the sector's full-year earnings growth expectations.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector's estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector's Q2 estimates at least prove that the shift to the annual growth pace isn't solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly the Mag 7 players that reported last week. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT , Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company's current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.We will be closely monitoring this curious turn in Tech sector estimates.The Earnings Big Picture While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven't been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy's growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

AppLovin and Boise Cascade have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1747398960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares AppLovin Corp. APP as the Bull of the Day and Boise Cascade BCC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AppLovin Corp. APP, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:AppLovin Corp. is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level.AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more.Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth.The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26.Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices.APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s 360% and Meta’s 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.Bear of the Day:Boise Cascade is one of the top North American producers of engineered wood products and plywood. BCC stock has tanked over 20% in 2025, driven by macroeconomic challenges, industry-specific headwinds, and operational pressures.The engineered wood products powerhouse missed our Q1 2025 earnings estimate by 22% on May 5. It also offered disappointing guidance as part of Boise Cascade’s extended trend of downward EPS revisions.What’s Going On with BCC Stock?Boise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022, before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and a slowing housing market.The company’s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively.Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted earnings dropped 59% YoY in the first quarter to $1.06 a share, missing our estimate by 22%. CEO Nate Jorgensen pointed to “constrained demand, difficult weather, and planned downtime at our Oakdale veneer and plywood mill” as part of its rough quarter and downbeat outlook.Boise Cascade's consensus 2025 earnings estimate has dropped 18% since its Q1 report. Its 2026 estimate has slipped 13% since then, and its overall negative earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company’s earnings are projected to fall another 31% YoY in 2025 on 2% lower sales.Stay Away from Boise Cascade Stock for Now?Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. The company also pays dividends and has a sturdy balance sheet.Investors might want to put Boise Cascade on their watchlists since it could be a longer-term winner. Unfortunately, BCC faces near-term headwinds driven by weak housing market demand, economic uncertainty, and more.Additional content:AppLovin Stock Plunges -26% in 3 Months: Is It a Buy Now?AppLovin Corp. has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry’s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP’s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin’s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand.Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP’s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the previous years.APP Is a BuyAPP presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its impressive financial performance and robust growth prospects. The company's recent results and strategic initiatives underscore its potential for continued success in the gaming and software sectors. AppLovin’s strong fundamentals, innovative technology and strategic growth initiatives position it as a leader in its industry. With a solid financial outlook and increasing analyst confidence, we recommend a ""Buy"" rating for APP stock to capitalize on its promising growth trajectory.APP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and global watchdogs have reportedly flagged Meta's role in a rising number of financial scams, with some banks reporting that nearly half of Zelle scam reports originated on its platforms. Despite repeated internal warnings and mounting losses to users, Meta has been slow to implement stricter ad verification and often permits known scammers to run dozens of fraudulent ads before enforcement, the WSJ reported.

""Recent data decisively refutes the claim that 'friends-and-family sharing' insulates Meta's apps from competition from (among many others) YouTube, iMessage, and, most dramatically, TikTok — a disruptive entrant that forced Meta to transform Facebook and Instagram or risk precipitous decline,"" Meta said in a Thursday court filing.

"AI Is Hitting Search Traffic, Testimony Suggests. Google Stock Falls. — Barrons.com",1746648780000,"By Angela PalumboAlphabet stock fell sharply after Bloomberg reported that an Apple executive's testimony pointed to artificial intelligence taking market share from traditional search.Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, testified in a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google that searches in Apple browsers fell for the first time as people turn to AI for their search queries, according to Bloomberg.This comes as the Justice Department investigates a longstanding partnership between Apple and Alphabet, in which Alphabet pays billions for Apple to use Google as its default search partner.Apple, Alphabet, and the Justice Department didn't respond to requests for comment.Shares of Alphabet closed down 7.3% as the testimony fueled investor concerns that Google might lose its crown as the king of search. Rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, and Meta AI offer increasingly popular alternatives.In 2024, Alphabet added a warning to the risk section of its 10-K annual report. ""Other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy,"" the company said in the filing.Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes rates Alphabet as a Hold with a $166 price target. He wrote in a note on Wednesday that ""today could be a historic turning point in Alphabet sentiment.""""Just trust your eyes and ears — people are going to ChatGPT (and others) for search-equivalent queries more and more,"" Reitzes said.Meanwhile, in August, a U.S. judge ruled that Google was a monopolist in general search services and general text advertising. One potential remedy to that search monopoly could prevent the exclusive agreements that have made Google the default search engine on different devices, including the iPhone.Shares of Apple, whose profits would take a hit were it to lose the Google search deal, were down 1.1% Wednesday.Bloomberg also reported on Wednesday that Cue wants Google to remain the default for Safari. But Cue said Apple has had discussions with Perplexity to add the AI search company's offering to Safari, as well.Perplexity didn't respond to a request for comment.Apple and ChatGPT-parent OpenAI announced a partnership in June.

The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms and Microsoft,1747392660000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:META vs. MSFT: Which AI Superpower Is a Better Buy?Meta Platforms and Microsoft have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies.Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month.Microsoft is now extending Copilot’s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date.

"AMD Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Up Y/Y, Shares Rise",1746634740000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD reported first-quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.23%. The figure surged 54.8% year over year. Revenues of $7.438 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.45% and increased 35.9% year over year, but declined 2.9% sequentially. The top-line growth benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that were partially offset by sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments.AMD shares have risen 1.80% in pre-market trading, driven by strong growth in the key segments. In the year-to-date period, AMD shares have plunged 18.4%.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD Q1 Top Line Rides on Data Center GrowthData Center revenues surged 57.2% year over year to $3.674 billion, accounting for 49.4% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues decreased 4.8% year over year.AMD’s top line benefited from strong Instinct GPU shipments and robust EPYC CPU sales.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. OCI Compute E6 shapes offered cost-to-performance gains, while Google Cloud launched C4D and H4D virtual machines for enhanced performance, scalability, and efficiency in general-purpose and HPC workloads.Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.In the first quarter of 2025, AMD expanded its partnerships with Meta Platforms META Dell Technologies DELL, Jio Platforms, Cisco Systems CSCO, Nokia and others to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure.AMD enhances support for frontier AI models on Instinct GPUs with ROCm software, offering day-zero support for the latest Meta AI Llama 4 and Google Gemma 3 models.

Sequentially, revenues decreased 0.8% year over year.AMD’s latest Ryzen CPUs, particularly those based on the Zen 5 architecture, have seen strong demand, especially for gaming and high-performance desktops and laptops. The launch of new products, like the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D, helped set sellout records and boosted the client segment.The sales of higher-end products, including Ryzen processors for both desktop and mobile, led to higher average selling prices and contributed positively to revenues.AMD Suffers From Weak Gaming & Embedded RevenuesThe Gaming segment’s revenues declined 29.8% year over year to $647 million, accounting for 8.7% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 14.9% year over year. The decline in year-over-year was primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenues.The Embedded segment revenues were $823 million, down 2.7% year over year and 10.8% sequentially. The segment accounted for 11.1% of total revenues.The decline can be attributed to a gradual recovery in demand across various markets, including test and measurement, communications, and aerospace. Additionally, inventory levels among customers in certain areas, such as the industrial sector, remained elevated, which contributed to the slower recovery.AMD’s Margins Expand Y/Y in Q1Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 53.7%, driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments’ revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 28.1% year over year to $2.213 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 320 bps on a year-over-year basis to 23.9% in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and gross margin.AMD’s Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Remains StrongAs of March 29, 2025, AMD had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.310 billion compared with $5.132 billion as of Dec. 28, 2024.As of March 29, 2025, total debt was $4.16 billion compared with $1.72 billion as of Dec. 28, 2024.Operating cash flow was reported at $939 million compared with $1.299 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.Free cash flow was $727 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with $1.091 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The company has $4 billion remaining under its current authorization.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveAMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%.For the second quarter, AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 43%.

Meta's Key AI Model Hit by Delay. What It Means for the Stock. — Barrons.com,1747386840000,"By Callum KeownMeta Platforms stock held steady early Friday after falling late in the previous session following a report that the Facebook parent is delaying the rollout of its new artificial intelligence model.The release of Meta's Behemoth large-language model was initially internally slated for April before it was pushed to June, but now the target has been delayed to the fall or later, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.The shares fell 2.4% Thursday and were flat in premarket trading Friday. The stock looks to be stabilizing following the losses, suggesting the delay may not have a huge impact on the price. Meta remains 10% higher in 2025 through Thursday's close — the best performer in the Magnificent Seven group.Engineers are struggling to improve the model's capabilities, leading to questions from staff over whether Behemoth has enough improvements over previous versions to justify a public release, the report added.The tech giant, like its peers, is spending billions of dollars on developing AI offerings. Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion at the end of last month, up from between $60 billion and $65 billion.Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.Separately, Meta asked a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's case alleging it run an illegal social media monopoly Thursday, Reuters reported. The antitrust trial, relating to Meta's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, began last month.Write to Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Zuckerberg's Grand Vision: Most of Your Friends Will Be AI — WSJ,1746610200000,"By Meghan BobrowskyMark Zuckerberg wants you to have AI friends, an AI therapist and AI business agents.In Zuckerberg's vision for a new digital future, artificial-intelligence friends outnumber human companions and chatbot experiences supplant therapists, ad agencies and coders. AI will play a central role in the human experience, the Facebook co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms has said in a series of recent podcasts, interviews and public appearances.""I think people are going to want a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do,"" Zuckerberg said Tuesday during an onstage interview with Stripe co-founder and president John Collison at Stripe's annual conference.Zuckerberg said on a podcast last week that he thinks the average person wants to have more friends and connections with other people than they currently do — and that AI friends are a solution.""The average American I think has, it's fewer than three friends, three people they'd consider friends, and the average person has demand for meaningfully more, I think it's like 15 friends,"" he said in the interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.On a separate podcast with media analyst Ben Thompson, Zuckerberg continued: ""For people who don't have a person who's a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI.""When someone is making a purchase and needs to speak to a person from that business, an AI agent will be there to help them, Zuckerberg said Tuesday.The Tuesday talk capped a media blitz that included high-profile podcasts and public talks with fellow tech executives including Collison, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. While the Meta CEO has been a guest on podcasts before, the number and quick succession of appearances was rare.Zuckerberg has had mixed success predicting how people will interact with each other in the future. He struck gold with Facebook in the 2000s and made lucrative acquisitions with Instagram and WhatsApp a few years later. More than a decade later, in 2022, he declared that vast numbers of people in the future would interact in virtual worlds and with augmented reality. That bet has yet to come to fruition.The Meta CEO is now throwing resources at AI chatbots — both in its social media apps and in its hardware devices. Meta AI, as it is called, is accessible via Instagram and Facebook, as a stand-alone app and on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said Tuesday that nearly a billion people are using the feature now monthly.Zuckerberg said personalized AI isn't just about knowing basic information about a user, it's about ensuring chatbots behave as a good friend might.""You have a deep understanding of what's going on in this person's life, "" he said on Thompson's podcast.Some people, however, aren't buying into Zuckerberg's vision.""The very platforms that have led to our social isolation and being chronically online are now posing a solution to the loneliness epidemic, "" said Meghana Dhar, a former Instagram executive who thinks AI friends will only make such problems worse. ""It almost seems like the arsonist coming back and being the fireman.""Meta has allowed chatbots on its apps to offer a full range of social interaction, including ""romantic role-play,"" even with children, The Wall Street Journal reported.Stephen Schueller, a professor of psychological science at the University of California, Irvine, said AI chatbots cannot fully replace friends or therapists but there are circumstances where the bots might be helpful.""Most people don't have access to a therapist,"" he said. ""So for them, it's not chatbot versus therapist. It's chatbot versus nothing.""Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250507002724:0/
Bull of the Day: AppLovin Corporation (APP),1747382400000,"AppLovin Corporation APP   is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level. AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more. Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth. The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26. Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices. APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s NVDA 360% and Meta’s META 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:884240936094b:0-bull-of-the-day-applovin-corporation-app/
Court clash between Meta and NSO ends in $168 million defeat for spyware firm,1746566380000,"Meta Platforms won a $168 million verdict against the Israeli surveillance firm NSO, the company said Tuesday, capping a six-year arm wrestling match between America's biggest social networking platform and the world's best known spyware company. Meta had already won a December ruling finding that NSO had unlawfully exploited a bug in its messaging service WhatsApp to plant spy software on its users' phones. On Tuesday, a jury in California ruled that NSO owed Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages - and $167.3 million in punitive damages, Meta said. ""Today's verdict in WhatsApp's case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,"" Meta said in a statement. In its statement, NSO said it would ""carefully examine the verdict's details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal."" NSO, an Israeli firm that first drew global attention in 2016, has become ""a poster child for the surveillance industry and their abuses and impunity,"" said Natalia Krapiva, a senior lawyer with the human rights group Access Now. NSO has long argued that its software is used to track terrorists and pedophiles, but the firm has been implicated in abusive surveillance in countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and El Salvador. WhatsApp's lawsuit - which was filed in 2019 and at one point made its way to the Supreme Court - has been closely followed both by NSO's competitors in the surveillance technology space and by human rights advocates critical of the industry. Victims of state-backed hacking have struggled to hold suppliers of spy software accountable for what their customers do with their tools, while hacking firms have long worried that their products could draw legal sanctions. The WhatsApp verdict was a sign that both outcomes were possible, said Krapiva. ""This is something that will hopefully show spyware companies that there will be consequences if you are careless, if you are brazen, and if you act in such a way as NSO did in these cases,"" she said.Beyond sending a message to spyware merchants, the case also pulled back the curtain - ever so slightly - on the inner workings of NSO itself.The court heard about NSO's 140 person-strong research team, whose $50 million budget was in part devoted to exploiting security vulnerabilities in smartphones. An attorney for the company disclosed that its customers included Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico - rare on-the-record names from NSO's closely guarded client list.Much about the spyware company's targets and clients remains unknown, in part because the firm refused to hand over evidence. In her December ruling, District Judge Phyllis Hamilton accused NSO of having ""repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery and failed to obey court orders regarding such discovery."" The Guardian newspaper reported last year that Israeli officials had seized documents from NSO in an effort to prevent the files from making their way to U.S. court.""This whole case is shrouded in so much secrecy,"" Hamilton said during the trial. ""There's so much that's not known.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RE02Z:0-court-clash-between-meta-and-nso-ends-in-168-million-defeat-for-spyware-firm/"

Meta Battles an 'Epidemic of Scams' as Criminals Flood Instagram and Facebook — WSJ,1747357200000,"By Jeff Horwitz and Angel Au-YeungFor almost two years, Edgar Guzman has been getting calls from irate customers who responded to his ads on Instagram and Facebook. Or at least they thought they were his ads.Guzman's company, called ""Half-Off Wholesale,"" offers home-improvement supplies and garden equipment in bulk out of a suburban Atlanta warehouse. The ads offer steep discounts that are mouthwatering to bargain hunters: $29 for a pallet of power tools, and mixed boxes of returned Amazon.com merchandise with a starting bid of just $1, for example.But when people send their payments, the products never arrive. When they call Guzman to complain, he has to deliver the bad news: They've been swindled.""What sucks is we have to break it to people that they've been scammed — we don't even do online sales,"" he said, noting that customer complaints about the rip-offs generate bad online reviews for his real business. ""We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.""Guzman's experience is not unusual.Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is increasingly a cornerstone of the internet fraud economy, according to regulators, banks and internal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The company accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a person familiar with the service. The peer-to-peer payment platform is owned by several banking giants, including JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank, and Wells Fargo. Other banks that offer Zelle have experienced similarly high fraud claims originating on Meta, according to people familiar with the matter.British and Australian regulators have found similar levels of fraud originating on Meta's platforms. An internal analysis from 2022 described in company documents likewise found that 70% of newly active advertisers on the platform are promoting scams, illicit goods or ""low quality"" products.In Guzman's case, a search of Meta's ad library this spring showed that more than 4,400 different ads listing the address of his business have run on Meta's platforms over the last year. Guzman's actual business was responsible for 15 of them.Account information for the scam pages shows they are run out of China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and the Philippines, but they use stolen pictures of Half-Off's warehouse and list its address.With more than 3 billion daily users on Meta's platforms, fraud is hardly a new phenomenon for the company. But fed by the rise of cryptocurrencies, generative AI and vast overseas crime networks based out of Southeast Asia, the immensity of Meta's scam problem is growing and has been regularly flagged by employees over the past several years.Current and former employees say Meta is reluctant to add impediments for ad-buying clients who drove a 22% increase in its advertising business last year to over $160 billion. Even after users demonstrate a history of scamming, Meta balks at removing them.One late 2024 document reviewed by the Journal shows that the company will allow advertisers to accrue between eight and 32 automated ""strikes"" for financial fraud before it bans their accounts. In instances where Meta employees personally escalate the problem, the limit can drop to between four and 16 strikes.Adding to the problem is Marketplace, its online secondhand-market that in less than a decade since its launch has surpassed Craigslist to become the internet's most heavily used repository of free classified ads. Its peer-to-peer model has also made Marketplace a popular hunting ground for scammers.A Meta spokesman said that the company is working to address ""an epidemic of scams"" that has grown in scale and complexity in recent years, driven by cross-border criminal networks.""As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts,"" he said. He added that Meta is testing the use of facial-recognition technology, adding warnings to users on its platforms and building partnerships with banks and tech companies ""since this crime affects many industries and cuts across different parts of society.""Meta has also argued in U.S. federal court that it bears no legal responsibility to address the issue.""The alleged underenforcement of Meta's monitoring policies cannot give rise to liability,"" the company wrote last year in a motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging negligence in removing cryptocurrency impersonation scams, adding that it ""does not owe a duty to users"" to address fraud on its platforms.The spokesman said the company nonetheless makes efforts to do so.""We of course don't want scammy activity on our platform and nothing about this statement — a nuanced legal argument — should be read to suggest otherwise,"" he said.Fake giveawaysMeta chief Mark Zuckerberg's recent move to scale back fact checking and policing of hate speech and other problem content has infuriated some and pleased others. But his company's ongoing ineffectiveness at governing fraud on its platforms has drawn less scrutiny — even though it causes widespread and tangible problems for consumers and businesses.Meta's lax approach has helped fuel the professionalization of social-media fraud by international criminal networks in Southeast Asia, says Erin West, a recently retired Santa Clara County prosecutor who helped author a U.S. Institute for Peace report last year on such activity.The report estimated organized scamming operations — often called ""pig butchering"" groups — comprise hundreds of thousands of people, many trafficked after falling for fraudulent social-media employment ads. Kept in prisonlike compounds, the workers are forced to work under threat of ""extreme forms of torture and abuse.""West said the growth of this nightmarish industry stems directly from the inaction of Meta and, to a lesser extent, its social-media peers.""If there's anybody who could make a huge dent here, it's Meta,"" she said. ""But there's no hammer over their head.""Losses to scams on Meta can range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but there's seemingly no target too small.Some of the frauds reflect substantial complexity and effort. In recent months, accounts featuring grandmotherly photos have been running Facebook and Instagram ads for a supposed giveaway of a McCormick & Co. spice rack and a selection of its products. Users are asked to provide only a nominal $9.99 shipping fee via a website featuring McCormick branding, a user survey and a game to win prizes.Marah Johnson of Orange County, Calif., has regularly encountered and reported scams on Facebook for years. But she fell for this one. After she entered her credit card information on the McCormick-branded website, she was billed for a series of fraudulent purchases totaling hundreds of dollars.""If their revenue is coming from fraud, what is their incentive to protect people?"" asked Johnson, a 58-year-old artist and jewelry-maker. ""It feels like Meta is helping the scammers out.""The scam is sufficiently widespread that McCormick Brands warned its 2 million followers on Facebook and Instagram of it on Jan. 31, eliciting hundreds of comments from users who said they'd been scammed.""I feel so stupid,"" wrote one.""I got hit for $70 I can't afford,"" responded another.""Why can't Facebook police these scammers?"" asked a third.A McCormick spokesperson declined to comment.Puppies for saleOne of the most common scams seen by banks involves the sale of pets, despite Meta's rules banning ""peer-to-peer sales or trade"" of live animals outside of narrow contexts.A recent search for ""puppies"" over several days yielded thousands of ads, most stating no affiliation with a known dog breeder or rescue organization as Meta's rules require.Other red flags abounded. Many of the results displayed common hallmarks of scams, including stolen photos of specific pets and ads from sellers supposedly ""near me"" who were actually operating out of Cameroon.JPMorgan has repeatedly raised concerns with Meta about its policing of scams, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person said the volume of scams attributable to Meta has shown some improvement in recent months.During that period both Meta and Zelle began issuing warnings to their respective users about scam risks arising from peer-to-peer payments.Documents reviewed by the Journal show that Meta has deprioritized scam enforcement in recent years, emphasizing the avoidance of erroneous ad takedowns over safety concerns. The company has also been cutting costs and shifting resources to other issues in the reshuffling.The company abandoned plans for advertiser verification requirements similar to what it mandates for political ads, people familiar with the matter say, on the grounds that it worried about losing revenue from marketers unwilling or unable to pass identity checks.Meta has periodically declared ""site events"" — company slang for internal emergencies of varying severity — for spikes in scams. But the company has generally treated scams as what documents describe as a ""low severity"" user experience issue rather than a significant threat to vulnerable people or vector for organized international crime.One 2022 document described ""a lack of investment"" in building automated tools to identify scams. The work's low priority within Meta was codified in an update that year of its content moderation processes that put more resources into addressing human trafficking and content promoting suicide and self-harm, and less on anti-scam measures.A mid-2022 analysis of the reprioritization found that it resulted in a 46% drop in likely scams reviewed within Facebook Groups.The Meta spokesman said that the documents seen by the Journal are old and that the company has been ramping up its investments in anti-scam work since the second half of 2022. He said it took down more than 2 million accounts linked to organized fraud operations last year. Of the advertiser accounts it shut down, he said, nearly 70% were caught within a week of their creation.Because of a safe harbor in U.S. telecommunications law known as section 230, platforms are generally shielded from liability for user-created content. Whether those protections apply to Meta's ads is now being tested by Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining billionaire and philanthropist who became frustrated in 2019 with Meta's failure to remove fraudulent investment advertisements using his image and AI-cloned voice.In a motion to dismiss the case last year, Meta argued that it is under no obligation to require investment advertisers to verify their identities or demonstrate that they're licensed to sell such products.""Because Meta has no duty to protect users from third-party content on its platform, Plaintiff cannot state a negligence claim,"" the company said.Write to Jeff Horwitz at jeff.horwitz@wsj.com and Angel Au-Yeung at angel.au-yeung@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515014756:0/
Goldman Sachs Still Sees 45% Recession Odds. These Stocks Can Hold Up. — Barrons.com,1746555240000,"By Paul R. La MonicaWhile the Trump administration is showing a willingness to do trade deals, some economists aren't convinced that the worst is over for the U.S. economy. Investors will need to prepare for the possibility of a more severe deterioration in consumer and business spending.Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs still puts the chance of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months at 45%. On Tuesday, he cited concerns about a trade war with China as well as ""a meaningful risk that some of the paused 'reciprocal' tariffs will take effect after all.""Economists at JPMorgan are even more bearish: They said Monday they are maintaining their call of 60% odds of a recession in the second half of this year.""This is not the beginning of the end of the trade war, but only the end of the beginning,"" the JPMorgan economists wrote.So how should investors navigate this landscape? Investors are already worried about the impact of a trade war on consumer goods — both for discretionary items and retailers as well as staples.Clorox, for example, said in its latest earnings report Monday that it was lowering its outlook ""to reflect recent changes in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment...as well as the impact of tariffs."" The stock tumbled 2% Tuesday on the news.But consumer staples broadly are still holding up a lot better than the rest of the market. Clorox may be the exception rather than the rule. Coca-Cola is the top stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025, while Philip Morris is one of the best performers in the S&P 500. Retailers Costco, Walmart and Kroger, which are classified as staples stocks, have enjoyed gains this year too.Others are also highlighting the virtues of investing in more defensive stocks. The recent winning streak for the broader market may have been a head fake.""The U.S. stock market is currently not pricing in a recession or even a meaningful slowdown. Investors appear to be expecting the 90-day tariff pause to become an off ramp for the Trump administration, allowing it time to slowly soften its aggressive trade policy without appearing to backtrack,"" said Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO and founding partner of asset management firm Bowersock Capital Partners, in an email.""The unappreciated risk is that the vacillations and lack of clarity on tariffs has already damaged the economy enough to cause a slowdown,"" she added.But Hill says there are still pockets of the market that look attractive. The technology sector remains a favorite, she said, noting that such stocks ""will continue to benefit from the AI-driven productivity boost to economic growth."" Hill recommends chip equipment company Lam Research.Others noted that recent earnings from some of the members of the Magnificent Seven are a good sign for tech, too.Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist with Ameriprise, said in a report that strong results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms are ""somewhat putting to rest the idea that spending on artificial intelligence is slowing down amid the tariff uncertainty.""Some financial stocks also might be worth owning — even if there is a recession. Hill said big banks should get a lift from the expectation that Trump will eventually push for deregulation of the industry and from hopes the Fed could start lowering interest rates again at some point this summer. Investors are betting on banks, too. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF, which has big holdings in JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, is up 2% this year.The ""digital payment adoption is likely to spur growth in parts of the financial sector,"" Hill adds. That would be good news for credit card lender/regional bank Capital One.Finally, healthcare is a defensive sector that has held up well — despite concerns about potential regulatory changes from the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and worries about insurer UnitedHealth's weak guidance.Other healthcare stocks — such as UnitedHealth rivals CVS (which owns insurer Aetna), Cigna and Elevance Health, drug companies Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, and equipment makers Intuitive Surgical and Medtronic — are all in positive territory this year. So is biotech Amgen, which Hill recommends.It's worth noting that most of the stocks in these flight-to-safety sectors also pay solid dividends. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF is flat this year. And with bond yields slipping as recession fears rise, owning stocks that provide steady income can help investors sleep better at night.Write to Paul R.

An Idaho Utility With Growth Potential — Barron's,1748050200000,"Idacorp offers a play on cheap power production and artificial intelligence. Its stock looks like a buy. By Al RootWhen you play Monopoly, you avoid the utilities — they're boring and don't make much money. In the game of life, however, picking up shares of Idacorp, Idaho's regulated electric utility, looks like a winning play.Boise-based Idacorp's principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power, a 109-year-old utility serving some 650,000 retail customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. It generates about two-thirds of the power it delivers to customers, while purchasing the rest. About 20% of the power it generates comes from coal, which the company plans to replace with gas by 2030, while more than half comes from relatively low-cost hydropower, which helps keep costs low for Idahoans. The average price paid by Idacorp customers is less than 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost one-third of what Northeasterners pay for their electricity.Northeastern envy isn't a good reason to buy the stock, though. Growth is. The company sees 8.3% demand growth over the next five years, up from about 1% over the past five. That growth is underpinned by low prices, population inflow, and power-hungry data centers producing cheap electricity for artificial-intelligence computers. Meta Platforms, for instance, is building a data center in Kuna, Idaho, about 20 miles outside of Boise.""It's just about the fastest-growing utility in the country right now,"" says John Bartlett, president and portfolio manager of Reaves Asset Management. The growth rate, expected to be about twice the industry norm, makes the shares look cheap. They trade for about 17 times estimated 2027 earnings and yield 3% — in line with utility averages.The stock hasn't been outperforming, however. Shares are up 6% year to date, about one percentage point behind the Vanguard Utilities exchange-traded fund, which yields a little less than 3%. It didn't help that Idacorp stock traded down about 2% following its May 1 first-quarter earnings report, when the company announced earnings per share of $1.10, seven cents ahead of Wall Street estimates, while reiterating full-year EPS guidance of $5.65 to $5.85. Investors might have been looking for a more substantive update on power rates and capital spending, writes Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell, adding that he thought the quarter was fine.""We view the Idacorp story as one of the strongest in the sub--$10 billion market-cap group,"" says Crowdell, who rates shares Outperform and has a $124 price target for the stock, up about 7% from recent levels.That might not seem like much upside, but it is partly a function of the sector. The median upside for an electric utility stock in the Russell 3000 is about 8% from current levels. Regulated utilities are supposed to be steady Eddies. Few expect them to double over a short period, but returns can be solid. With typical earnings growth for the sector of 6% to 7% and dividend yields of 3%, a 10% total annual return is possible, says Bartlett. Unregulated utilities such as Constellation Energy take more risks on pricing and capacity expansion, hoping to boost asset returns and earnings growth.Idacorp, however, is unusual as a regulated utility with unregulated-like growth. Wall Street projects that earnings will grow close to 8% a year for the coming three years, but Bartlett sees growth better than that as generation capacity expands. It could look more like Constellation's 14% average annual earnings growth. Idacorp stock, however, doesn't trade like Constellation, which fetches 26 times estimated 2026 earnings. Crowdell sees the opportunity for shares to ""rerate"" to a higher price/earnings ratio, but that isn't reflected in his target price.Utilities aren't risk free. Because they're often bought for income, rising long-term bond yields tend to weigh on the sector's valuation multiples, something that's out of Idacorp's control. The group can also suffer ""rate lag"" — when regulators drag out the price increases that enable growth and expansion of capacity. That's something Idacorp can influence. ""Our efforts to reduce regulatory lag [and] provide more timely cost recovery are certainly under way,"" said Tim Tatum, Idacorp's vice president of regulatory affairs, on his company's first-quarter conference call. ""We're hopeful for success in that area."" Idacorp is planning to file a ""rate case"" in late May or early June. A favorable outcome with regulators could give shares a boost later this year.It's necessary, too, as Idacorp invests for growth. Siebert Williams Shank analyst Christopher Ellinghaus expects the company to spend $5.6 billion on new plants and equipment over the coming five years, up from $2.8 billion spent from 2020 to 2024. Higher spending could pressure the balance sheet. The company's net debt is 4.3 times as large as its estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, higher than investors might be used to, but about average for an electric utility.The company is taking steps to make sure its balance sheet doesn't become a problem. Earlier this month, Idacorp raised $575 million in equity capital by selling 5.2 million shares. The sale solidifies the equity financing needed through 2026, says Ellinghaus, who has equity dilution factored into his earnings model. He rates shares Buy and has a $129 price target for the stock, up 11% from recent levels. ""The company has a slew of electricity resource and transmission investments in the hopper,"" he adds, designed to serve ""some of the fastest prospective electricity customer, sales...and rate base growth in the industry.""The risks look manageable, the growth substantial, and the valuation reasonable, making Idacorp stock an undiscovered gem in the Gem State.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522000714:0/
Meta asks judge to rule that FTC failed to prove its monopoly case,1747351159000,"Facebook parent company Meta Platforms asked a Washington judge on Thursday to throw out the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case accusing it of an illegal social media monopoly, saying the agency failed to prove its case at a high-stakes antitrust trial over the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_S0N3PP0GD:0-meta-asks-judge-to-rule-that-ftc-failed-to-prove-its-monopoly-case/"
This zero-day options craze could finally be coming to popular stocks like Nvidia and Tesla. Here's what to know.,1746543180000,"By Joseph AdinolfiNasdaq has asked the SEC for permission to list options tied to a handful of popular stocks that would expire on Mondays and WednesdaysAn earlier version of this story incorrectly named Scott Bauer's firm.A surge in trading of so-called ""zero days to expiry"" - or ""0DTE"" - options has contributed to an options-market boom over the past few years, drawing in both sophisticated investors and amateur speculators.During the trading week, investors have been limited to trading 0DTE contracts tied to stock-market indexes like the S&P 500 and a handful of popular ETFs, including the Invesco QQQ Trust.But after a long wait, they could soon be coming for popular stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)In a filing published late last week, Nasdaq Inc. officially asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to expand offerings of option contracts tied to a handful of individual stocks. If the SEC signs off, the exchange would be allowed to list options tied to a select group of stocks that expire on Mondays and Wednesdays, giving traders two more opportunities per week to trade option contracts on the edge of expiration.""It's probably been a long time in the making,"" Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy and a former floor trader on a major options exchange, told MarketWatch.Currently, options tied to individual common stocks only expire on Fridays, while contracts tied to some stock-market indexes and highly liquid ETFs have more frequent expirations.Although a Nasdaq executive declined to comment on the exchange's plans, traders and industry experts who spoke with MarketWatch said that, if all goes well, contracts expiring on Tuesdays and Thursdays could soon follow.""They're not pure 0DTEs in the sense that they're not listed every day, but it's getting pretty close,"" Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics, told MarketWatch.See: 2024 was another record-breaking year for options trading. What's on tap for the industry in 2025.What is a '0DTE' option?Any option due to expire at the end of a session is considered a 0DTE contract. Technically, every option becomes a 0DTE on the last day of its life.Traders who spoke with MarketWatch have said the appeal of these contracts lies in the small chance of an outsize gain. If the market pushes them into the money before they expire, it could lead to a large windfall for a trader who had bought them minutes or hours earlier.Back in 2022, popular exchange operators like Cboe Global Markets expanded offerings tied to the S&P 500 and a few popular ETFs to allow traders to trade 0DTE contracts every day of the trading week. The change helped accelerate a boom in options trading that had begun shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic.The average daily trading volume in these extremely short-dated contracts has been climbing steadily since. 0DTE volumes in S&P 500 index options hit a record during the first quarter of 2025, according to Cboe data.A Cboe analyst estimated that roughly 50% to 60% of the average daily activity in S&P 500 0DTE contracts involves amateur individual investors, although the exact share is difficult to determine precisely.Their rise has coincided with a surge in activity across the broader U.S. equity-options market. According to the Options Clearing Corporation, the industry's main clearinghouse, more than 12 billion contracts changed hands in 2024, setting a record for the fifth year in a row.It appears another record could follow in 2025, with the industry already on track to top 14 billion contracts traded, according to Henry Schwartz, vice president of market intelligence at Cboe.'We're working closely with everybody'The SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny Nasdaq's request once the filing is published in the Federal Register, which had not yet happened as of Tuesday morning. A representative for the SEC didn't return a request for comment from MarketWatch.Once approved, these options could start trading within days.Nasdaq's decision to request the change was the culmination of a lengthy process by exchanges, brokerage platforms, market makers and other options-industry players. The goal was to figure out the best way to introduce more short-dated contracts tied to shares of individual stocks in a manner that would minimize risks for the industry and its customers.Ultimately, the exchange decided that Monday and Wednesday contracts wouldn't be listed on any day when the underlying company is due to report quarterly earnings. This should help to limit the chances that volatile swings in stocks after the closing bell could complicate trade settlements, a Nasdaq representative said.""We're working closely with everybody to make sure we're doing this in a safe and responsible way,"" said Greg Ferrari, a senior vice president at Nasdaq within the market platforms division.The changes proposed by Nasdaq would only allow Monday and Wednesday expirations for a handful of stocks and one additional ETF. As of January 2025, only contracts tied to Nvidia, Tesla, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) would be eligible for the Monday and Wednesday listings, along with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF XLF.'Lottery tickets'Options-market activity has been trending toward shorter-dated contracts for years, said OptionMetrics' DeSimone.At the same time, the advent of free-to-trade electronic brokerages has helped inspire a new generation of amateur individual investors to try their hand at options trading.Making it easier to trade 0DTE tied to individual stocks could accelerate both of these trends, DeSimone said. While institutional players still dominate index options, individual traders are more active in the single-stock space, DeSimone said.DeSimone cautioned that anybody interested in trading these products should keep their risk profile in mind. Some in the industry have likened 0DTE contracts to ""lottery tickets"" that offer a small chance of a large payout, and a high likelihood that the contract will expire worthless.JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, parent of brokerage tastytrade, pushed back against this characterization, calling it hyperbolic. He said many investors trade 0DTE options as part of spread strategies involving more than one contract, allowing them to more precisely manage their risk. Nasdaq and others have said that 0DTEs can help large traders more tactically manage their risk.""I think people are excited for the opportunity, but again I think we'll need to do some more education regarding exercise and assignment risk,"" Kinahan said. ""We have to continue to educate as to what the risks of these are, especially after the close.""-Joseph AdinolfiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/
"Markets Mostly Up on Mid-East Wheeling, Dealing",1747346880000,"Thursday, May 15, 2025Markets closed mostly up this session on moderately good news rippling through economic concerns throughout the day. With President Trump continuing his tour through the Middle East, we’re seeing a plethora of deals being made there with American corporations:Boeing BA will send more than 200 jets to Qatar Airways, $142 billion in military equipment investments will go to Saudi Arabia, billions more in Saudi infrastructure with supplies from AMD AMD, Cisco CSCO and others, and 18K AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA will be sent to a company chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.The Dow gained +271 points today, +0.65%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.52%. The Nasdaq, which has risen +13% over the past month, faltered this afternoon following news reports of an SEC investigation into Coinbase COIN and a cybersecurity hack, sending the stock down -7% today. Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks. But we we see Import and Export Prices ahead of the open, as well as Housing Starts and Building Permits — all for April. Earlier today, we saw a sagging Homebuilders Confidence survey for May, as high mortgage and home prices are remaining out of range for many prospective buyers, with many others feeling prices may be due to come down over the coming months. We’ll also see a new preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey for May on Friday, as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to Note for INOD Ahead of Q1 ResultsInnodata approaches its first-quarter 2025 earnings report following an exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, where the company posted record-breaking 127% year-over-year growth and substantial profit improvements. While the strong momentum is expected to continue, several factors suggest investors should hold their positions or await a better entry point before adding to their stakes.The recent beta launch of Innodata's Generative AI Test & Evaluation Platform, powered by NVIDIA technology, represents a strategic expansion of the company's AI services portfolio. This platform, showcased at NVIDIA GTC 2025 in March, aims to address enterprise needs for AI risk mitigation and performance optimization. While this initiative aligns with Innodata's growth strategy in the AI services market, the platform's full commercial release isn't expected until the second quarter of 2025, limiting its revenue impact on first-quarter results.Innodata's strong relationship with its largest customer, which contributed significantly to the fourth quarter of 2024 results, is likely to have continued to drive growth in first-quarter 2025. The company previously announced additional programs valued at approximately $24 million in annualized run rate revenues with this customer. However, this concentration risk remains a concern, despite efforts to diversify the client base by expanding relationships with seven other Big Tech customers.The company's forecast of 40% or more revenue growth for full-year 2025 suggests continued strong performance, but the projected reinvestment of cash from operations back into the business might have temporarily impacted profit margins in the first quarter. These investments, while positioning Innodata for sustained multi-year growth, could create near-term volatility in financial metrics.Industry tailwinds from AI-driven capital expenditure among major tech companies are likely to have benefited Innodata in the first quarter of 2025, as the company continues to position itself as a key player in the growing AI services market. The company's strong balance sheet, with $46.9 million in cash at the end of 2024, provides flexibility to execute its expansion strategy while weathering any short-term fluctuations.Investors should monitor how effectively Innodata is diversifying its customer base and commercializing new offerings like the AI Test & Evaluation Platform. While the long-term growth prospects remain promising, potential volatility associated with ongoing investments and customer concentration suggests a cautious approach ahead of the first-quarter 2025 earnings report.INOD Price Performance & Stock ValuationINOD shares have skyrocketed 467.5% in the trailing 12-month period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 5.1% and the industry’s return of 7.5%.1-Year PerformanceWhile INOD stock trades at a premium with a six-month forward 12-month P/S ratio of 4.62x compared with the Zacks Computer – Services industry average of 1.75x, this premium valuation appears justified given the company's strong growth prospects and strategic positioning in the generative AI (GenAI) space.INOD’s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched ValuationMorgan Stanley has projected combined capital expenditures of $300 billion in 2025 and $337 billion in 2026 for Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft on GenAI and large language model-enabled advancements. By focusing on Big Tech’s increasing investments in GenAI, Innodata has positioned itself as a key partner for data engineering, particularly in creating supervised fine-tuning data for training advanced AI models.Investment ThesisInnodata's investment case presents a mixed outlook ahead of first-quarter 2025 results. While the company delivered 127% growth in fourth-quarter 2024 and projects more than 40% revenue growth for 2025, investors should exercise caution at current valuation levels. The beta launch of its NVIDIA-powered AI Test & Evaluation Platform represents future potential, but full commercialization won't occur until the second quarter. Customer concentration risk persists despite diversification efforts with other Big Tech clients. Planned reinvestment in operations may temporarily pressure margins, despite the strong $46.9 million cash position.ConclusionInnodata presents a cautious investment case with recent record growth juxtaposed against premium valuation and increasing competition in AI services. The unrealized first-quarter impact of its NVIDIA-powered platform, ongoing customer concentration risks, and planned reinvestments suggest potential near-term volatility. Investors should consider holding existing positions or awaiting a more attractive entry point following the first-quarter results.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:3ac46fc6e094b:0-buy-sell-or-hold-innodata-stock-key-tips-ahead-of-q1-earnings/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Why Big Tech ETFs Still Remain Great Bets,1746535320000,"The start of the year 2025 was not kind to Big Tech stocks due to trade tensions, fears of rising inflation, and the rise of low-cost artificial intelligence companies in China. The tech-heavy ETF Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ is off 4.8% so far this year and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK has lost 7.1% in the year-to-date frame (as of May 5, 2025).However, this might be a temporary blip, and investors should be unfazed by the year-to-date decline in Big Tech stocks. The tech segment is proving its resilience once again, as evident from the 17.4% past-month uptick in XLK and 14.7% rise in QQQ.Below, we highlight a few factors that say Big Tech stocks and ETFs are still safe and great investments.Earnings Blow Past ExpectationsThis earnings season has underscored how the largest technology companies continue to outperform the broader S&P 500, even amid concerns over tariffs. Excluding NVIDIA NVDA, which reports later this month, the other six members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" beat Wall Street estimates by an average of 16%, according to Bank of America, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. That’s a sharp contrast to the 4% earnings beat recorded by the rest of the S&P 500 so far.Forget Pullback: AI Remains the Key FocusWhile the tech sector is still recovering from a pullback in February—triggered in part by market reactions to low-cost AI DeepSeek—this hasn't derailed investor optimism. Instead, the pullback caused some valuation corrections and set the stage for renewed focus on U.S. tech leadership and AI investment.According to Bank of America, the current earnings cycle confirms that hyperscalers are continuing with their AI investment strategies, even if capex growth is moderating slightly.Capex Surge Signals Long-Term ConfidenceTech giants have not held back on capital expenditures, despite the rise of low-cost AI challengers. Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT reiterated their investment plans during earnings calls. Meta META even raised its full-year capex forecast, while Amazon AMZN reported continued triple-digit growth in its AI-related revenues.Bank of America reports that capital spending by the hyperscaler group grew by 62% year-over-year this quarter, with a projected 35% increase for the full year, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Big Capex = Big Conviction? Despite trade tensions, Big Tech’s aggressive forward plans stand out. In an environment where many are hesitant, these companies are forging ahead. This shows their conviction in their investment plans.Any Wall of Worry?Amazon — the cloud computing leader — reported slowing growth, attributing it to capacity limitations in its data center infrastructure. However, Amazon’s revenue outlook met consensus estimates, highlighting the strength and adaptability of its business model amid a tough operating landscape owing to tariffs.For some, like Alphabet’s Google search franchise, is seen as under threat in the emerging AI world, and the company remains determined to defend its territory. Of the Mag 7 players, Apple faced the most pronounced tariff impact, which has been well known due to its significant exposure to China. If the government manages to strike a trade deal with China or Apple secures some exemptions from government, the outlook for Apple should improve.ETFs in Focus Given this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We have highlighted some ETFs with the largest exposure to Mag 7.Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS – Down 12.2% YTD; Up 14.6% Past MonthMicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS – Down 2.7% YTD; Up 21.5% Past MonthVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK – Down 5.8% YTD; Up 16.2% Past MonthInvesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG – Down 6.6% YTD; Up 12% Past MonthThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6a02ae310094b:0-why-big-tech-etfs-still-remain-great-bets/
Meta Shares Dip as German Court Backs AI Data Use,1748020042000,"Meta NASDAQ:META slips 1.11% as German court refuses to block AI training on Facebook and Instagram data.Shares of Meta fell just over 1% after Verbraucherzentrale NRW lost its bid for a preliminary injunction aimed at stopping the company from using EU user posts to train its AI models. In April, Meta announced it would begin tapping interactions and public adult content on Facebook and Instagram for model training, having postponed similar plans last year amid regulatory uncertainty.This follows March's rollout of Meta's AI chatbot service in Europe after a year-long delay. An Austrian group, noyb, also sought an injunction earlier this month over the same data-use plans. Meta said navigating the EU's complex regulatory system took longer than expected but that it was glad we're finally here, underscoring its push to bolster AI capabilities on the continent.Why It Matters: Continued legal challenges in Europe could slow Meta's AI roadmap and weigh on growth if enforcement tightens around user-data usage.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:2bd3446cf094b:0-meta-shares-dip-as-german-court-backs-ai-data-use/

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft",1746535320000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 6, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.The Standout Magnificent 7 Stock: Microsoft's Quiet DominanceOver the past two weeks, most of the Magnificent 7 have reported earnings, and the results were broadly positive, reinforcing the strength and scale of these market leaders. Last week brought reports from Amazon , Apple , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , while the prior week featured Alphabet and Tesla .Among them, one company quietly stood above the rest: Microsoft.Microsoft's earnings results aren't the only thing prompting me to highlight the stock either—MSFT also boasts the highest Zacks Rank of the Mag 7 group, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been the best performing stock over the last one month, three months and year-to-date of the group.Microsoft Cloud Growth Leads Amazon and AlphabetMicrosoft's cloud business was the clear standout this quarter. Azure revenue grew 33% year-over-year , which was the fastest among the three major cloud providers, with AI services alone contributing 12 percentage points to that growth. The broader Intelligent Cloud segment reported $26.8 billion in revenue, up 21% from the prior year, with operating income reaching $11.1 billion.By comparison, Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted revenue of $29.3 billion, maintaining its lead in scale but growing just 17% , it marked the slowest pace of growth in five quarters. While AWS remains highly profitable, with a record 39.5% operating margin, the slowdown raises questions about whether it's ceding growth momentum to competitors.Google Cloud also delivered strong results, with revenue up 28% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Operating income came in at $2.2 billion, a significant improvement from $900 million a year ago, showing continued progress toward profitability.Taken together, these results highlight Microsoft's continued leadership in enterprise cloud and its growing advantage in AI infrastructure — both key drivers of long-term value. Azure's faster growth rate not only reinforces Microsoft's competitive edge, but also reflects its broader strategic positioning in what remains one of the most critical areas of tech spending.MSFT Stock has Less Tariff Risks Than AAPL, META and AMZNAs US–China trade tensions rise, tariff exposure has become a key risk factor for large-cap tech investors. Among the Magnificent 7, Microsoft is uniquely positioned, not only due to its strong fundamentals, but also because of its relatively low exposure to China and tariff-related disruptions.Apple stands out as one of the most vulnerable. The company's reliance on Chinese manufacturing for iPhones, iPads, and other hardware makes it especially sensitive to rising import costs and potential supply chain snarls. A significant portion of Apple's revenue also comes from Chinese consumers—a market that could easily be affected by retaliatory measures.Amazon faces its own set of challenges. While its core North American business remains robust, the company's global retail supply chain depends heavily on low-cost manufacturing hubs in China. Tariffs on goods shipped to the US from China could squeeze margins or complicate logistics for its sellers.Meta Platforms is less directly exposed to supply chains but faces its own geopolitical and macro risks. The company has long been restricted in China, but it still relies on global ad spending from brands with supply chains and customer bases in the region. In a deteriorating US–China trade environment, global advertising spend could weaken, affecting Meta's growth.Microsoft, by contrast, benefits from a business model centered around software, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise services, which are less vulnerable to tariffs or localized trade friction. Its supply chain exposure to China is limited, and its revenue is globally diversified, with much of its growth coming from the US, Europe, and emerging AI-driven demand.Magnificent 7 Valuations Appear FairMicrosoft currently holds the highest earnings multiple among the Magnificent 7, but that premium may be well-earned. While MSFT trades above its peers, it remains in line with its five-year median earnings multiple and so do Apple and Meta, which suggests that valuations are fair from a historical perspective.The rest of the group is trading well below their five-year averages, a welcome development for valuation-conscious investors after the sharp run-ups in recent years. Importantly, these valuations come alongside healthy earnings growth forecasts, which range from 12.8% annually for Apple to as high as 24.7% for Nvidia. Microsoft is expected to grow its earnings 14.6% annually over the next three to five years.With Microsoft's strong competitive positioning, durable growth, and relatively low macro risk, its premium multiple appears justified, however, most of the Magnificent 7 stocks appear attractively valued.Should Investors Buy Shares in MSFT?Microsoft continues to stand out as a well-rounded member of the Magnificent 7—delivering top-tier cloud growth, strong earnings momentum, and relatively low exposure to macro and geopolitical risks. Its premium valuation appears justified given its leadership in AI and enterprise business, and its stock performance reflects growing investor confidence.While many of its peers also look attractively valued after recent pullbacks, Microsoft remains a compelling core holding for long-term investors seeking stability, growth, and resilience in an uncertain market.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e3d25ab2c094b:0-zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-amazon-apple-meta-platforms-and-microsoft/

Inside Last Week's Wall Street Rally & Best-Performing ETF Areas ,1746524940000,"The S&P 500 just marked its longest winning streak since November 2004, closing higher for multiple sessions. U.S. stocks surged on Friday, marking a significant comeback for major indexes, led by a strong jobs report and a possible breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations.The S&P 500 jumped nearly 1.5%, surpassing its April 2 closing level—referred to by President Trump as “Liberation Day,” when sweeping tariffs were announced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, logging its ninth consecutive winning day. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite also climbed roughly 1.5%.Weekly Market Performance: All Major Indexes ClimbFriday’s rally capped off a strong week for U.S. equities. The Dow rose 3%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a 3.4% gain. Optimism over Big Tech earnings and signs of progress in trade discussions were key drivers of the weekly surge.Job Market Beats ExpectationsMarkets were buoyed by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, exceeding economists’ expectations of 138,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, signaling continued strength in the labor market despite recent volatility tied to tariff fears.Hopes Rise for U.S.-China Trade TalksInvestor optimism was further fueled by news from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry indicated openness to talks, saying the ""door is open"" for negotiations if the U.S. agrees to scale back reciprocal tariffs. This development suggested a possible thaw in trade tensions that had rattled markets since April.Microsoft and Meta Lead the 'Magnificent 7'Among the tech heavyweights, Microsoft MSFT and Meta META stood out last week. Microsoft soared over 11% last week, marking its best performance since March 2023. Meta also posted its strongest week since February 2024. In contrast, Apple lagged behind, falling over 2% for the week following its quarterly results.Apple & Amazon React to Tariff PressuresDespite strong earnings, some tech giants felt the pressure of trade uncertainty. Apple AAPL reported a $900 million tariff headwind this quarter and cut its share buyback program by $10 billion, causing its stock to dip. Amazon AMZN posted solid earnings but offered cautious guidance, citing tariffs and trade policy as key concerns. Its shares ended the day little changed.Winning ETF Areas of the Last Week in Focus Against this backdrop, below we highlight the top-performing exchange-traded fund (ETF) areas of the last week.Natural Gas – United States Natural Gas Fund LP UNG – Up 15%U.S. natural gas prices surged last week, thanks to a drop in output and record LNG exports. Production has fallen to a two-month low.Taiwan – iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EWT – Up 9.7%The outlook for Asian markets is positive. Following gains in U.S. and European markets, Asian markets also gained. Cues of trade de-escalation have also acted positively for the Taiwan market.Cryptocurrency – First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT – Up 7.5%Bitcoin gained 1.6% last week on the comeback of the risk-on trade sentiment. This benefited the cryptocurrency stocks overall. Uranium Miners – Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF URNJ – Up 6.9%The uranium demand is on the rise as AI-driven data centers fuel greater power needs. The World Nuclear Association, as quoted on Oilprice.com, projects reactor demand to increase 28% by 2030 and nearly double by 2040. Some Big Tech earnings released last week revealed that their capex on AI remains on track, which boosted the URNJ ETF (read: Is This the Perfect Time to Invest in Uranium ETFs?).Pharma – Roundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF OZEM – Up 6.4%Novo Nordisk  NVO said the Food and Drug Administration accepted its submission of a new drug application for a Wegovy pill to treat obesity amid an intense race to get an oral weight-loss medication on the market. If approved, Wegovy would become the first oral formulation of a GLP-1 drug for chronic weight management. The NVO stock, which surged 11.4% last week, makes up about 12% of the fund OZEM.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:f42f5c1ca094b:0-inside-last-week-s-wall-street-rally-best-performing-etf-areas/

Best-Performing Leveraged ETFs of Last Week,1746524520000,"The S&P 500 just marked its longest winning streak since November 2004, closing higher for multiple sessions. U.S. stocks surged on Friday, marking a significant comeback for major indexes, led by a strong jobs report and a possible breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations.The S&P 500 jumped nearly 1.5%, surpassing its April 2 closing level—referred to by President Trump as “Liberation Day,” when sweeping tariffs were announced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, logging its ninth consecutive winning day. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite also climbed roughly 1.5%.Weekly Market Performance: All Major Indexes ClimbFriday’s rally capped off a strong week for U.S. equities. The Dow rose 3%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a 3.4% gain. Optimism over Big Tech earnings and signs of progress in trade discussions were key drivers of the weekly surge.Job Market Beats ExpectationsMarkets were buoyed by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, exceeding economists’ expectations of 138,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, signaling continued strength in the labor market despite recent volatility tied to tariff fears.Hopes Rise for U.S.-China Trade TalksInvestor optimism was further fueled by news from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry indicated openness to talks, saying the ""door is open"" for negotiations if the U.S. agrees to scale back reciprocal tariffs. This development suggested a possible thaw in trade tensions that had rattled markets since April.Microsoft and Meta Lead the 'Magnificent 7'Among the tech heavyweights, Microsoft MSFT and Meta META stood out last week. Microsoft soared over 11% last week, marking its best performance since March 2023. Meta also posted its strongest week since February 2024. In contrast, Apple AAPL lagged behind, falling over 2% for the week following its quarterly results.Apple & Amazon React to Tariff PressuresDespite strong earnings, some tech giants felt the pressure of trade uncertainty. Apple reported a $900 million tariff headwind this quarter and cut its share buyback program by $10 billion, causing its stock to dip. Amazon AMZN posted solid earnings but offered cautious guidance, citing tariffs and trade policy as key concerns. Its shares ended the day little changed.Best Leveraged ETFs of Last Week Against this backdrop, below we highlight the top-performing leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) areas of the last week.Defiance Daily Target 2X Long HIMS ETF HIMZ – Up 74.1% Last WeekHims & Hers has consistently witnessed strong market acceptance of its range of curated health and wellness products and services over the past few months. Hims & Hers partnered with Novo Nordisk NVO to expand access to its popular obesity care.

The sources told Bloomberg that the company intends to commence production of the prototypes of the glasses, which are expected to have cameras, microphones and speakers, at the end of 2025 with offshore suppliers.

"Meta to Delay Rollout of Flagship AI Model Nicknamed 'Behemoth,' Sources Say — WSJ",1747336620000,"By Meghan Bobrowsky and Sam SchechnerMeta is delaying the rollout of a flagship AI model, prompting internal concerns about the direction of its multibillion-dollar AI investments, people familiar with the matter said.Company engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its ""Behemoth"" large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release, the people said.Early in its development, Behemoth was internally slated for an April release to coincide with Meta's inaugural AI conference for developers. Meta put out two smaller models in its Llama AI model family ahead of the event, but later pushed an internal target for the larger Behemoth's release to June. Now, it's been delayed to fall or later.Meta has previously drawn praise for the speed with which it's caught up to rivals in the global AI arms race--spending billions of dollars along the way to develop the technology that powers chatbots on WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. Meta plans to spend up to $72 billion in capital expenditures this year, much of which will be used to help realize Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's grand ambitions for AI.Zuckerberg and other Meta executives haven't publicly committed to a timeline for Behemoth. The company could ultimately decide to release Behemoth sooner than expected, including by rolling out a more limited version. But Meta engineers and researchers are concerned its performance wouldn't match public statements about its capabilities, the people said.A Meta spokesman declined to comment.Senior executives at the company are frustrated at the performance of the team that built the Llama 4 models and blame them for the failure to make progress on Behemoth, according to people familiar with their views. Meta is contemplating significant management changes to its AI product group as a result, the people said.The Facebook-parent has publicly touted the capabilities of Behemoth, saying it already outperforms similar technology from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on some tests. But internally, its performance has been hobbled by training challenges, the people said.Meta's recent challenges mirror stumbles or delays at other top AI companies that are trying to release their next big state-of-the-art models. Some researchers see the pattern as evidence that future advances in AI models could come at a far slower pace than in the past, and at tremendous cost.""Right now, the progress is quite small across all the labs, all the models,"" said Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an assistant professor and faculty fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science.GPT-5, one of OpenAI's next big technological leaps forward, was initially expected around mid-2024, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. In December, The Journal reported that development on the model was running behind schedule.In February, OpenAI Chief Sam Altman said the model would be released as GPT-4.5 and that GPT-5 — the model they hoped would come with bigger technological breakthroughs — was still months away. ChatGPT currently runs on versions of GPT-4o. OpenAI declined to comment on the timing of GPT-5's release.Anthropic last year said it was working on a new model called Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger version of the AI models it released last year and has continued to update. That heftier version still hasn't been released. A spokeswoman says Opus is coming soon.Meta's first version of Llama was produced by its Fundamental AI Research Team, which largely consists of academics and researchers with doctorate degrees. The team released the models and a research paper explaining them to the public in early 2023.Since then, 11 of the 14 researchers on that original paper have left the company. The Llama models since the first ones have been developed by a different team. The Information earlier reported on problems Meta was having with some of its recent Llama models.The two models that were released in April initially performed well on a popular AI chatbot leaderboard. However, it was later revealed that the model submitted to the leaderboard was not the same model that was released to the public.Representatives for the leaderboard said Meta should have made it clearer that it had submitted a customized model intended to do well on its benchmark test. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Meta submitted a version of its AI model to the leaderboard that was optimized to do well on the third-party performance test.Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at Sam.Schechner@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515011062:0/
"Buy, Sell, or Hold These Mag 7 Stocks After Earnings: AAPL, AMZN ",1746476280000,"Markets haven’t kept the momentum investors were hoping for after receiving much-anticipated quarterly results from Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL last Thursday.While both were able to exceed top and bottom-line expectations, their guidance was somewhat underwhelming compared to the more reassuring outlook given by other Mag-7 tech giants like Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Amazon’s Q1 Review Following previous news reports that Amazon had planned to highlight how higher tariffs are raising prices on its platform, the e-commerce giant stated it’s working to keep prices low amid an uncertain moment for consumers. Amazon’s Q1 sales rose 10% year over year to $155.66 billion and eclipsed estimates of $154.56 billion. Notably, Amazon’s cloud computing division, AWS, contributed to 19% of its Q1 sales and increased 17% YoY to $29.3 billion. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS of $1.59 comfortably exceeded expectations of $1.35 by 17% and spiked 40% from $1.13 per share a year ago. Amazon has exceeded sales estimates in three of its last four quarterly reports and has beaten earnings expectations for 10 consecutive quarters.Apple’s Q2 Review Reporting results for its fiscal second quarter, Apple’s Q2 sales were up 5% to $95.35 billion and topped estimates of $94.26 billion. Apple also highlighted that its services segment achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.7 billion, which increased 12% from the comparative quarter and was driven by strong performance across Apple Music, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other subscription-based services.Apple’s Q2 EPS of $1.65 was up 8% from $1.53 in the prior period and beat estimates of $1.61 per share by 2%. Furthermore, Apple has exceeded its top and bottom-line expectations for nine consecutive quarters. Amazon & Apple’s Guidance Amazon expects Q2 sales at $159-$164 billion with the current Zacks Consensus at $161.62 billion or 9% growth (Current Qtr below). Still, Amazon stated the external environment remains complex, with its Q2 operating income guidance of $13-$17.5 billion coming short of many analyst expectations of $17.8 billion. As for Apple, the company expects its Q3 sales to grow by low to mid-single digits, with the Zacks Consensus at $89.12 billion or 4% growth. Weighing on investor sentiment was that Apple expects $900 million in tariff-related costs on a 16% tax rate, although it projects its Q3 gross margins between 45.5%-46.5%.Apple expects Q3 operating expenses between $15.3-$15.4 billion. It’s noteworthy that Apple does plan to source 19 billion chips from a dozen states this year, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona, which should help to relieve tax-related pressures from a heavy reliance on international manufacturing in China, Taiwan, and India. What the Zacks Rank Suggests While it may be tempting to buy the 14% and 20% year-to-date drop in Amazon and Apple’s stock, respectively, the Zacks Rank suggests there could still be better buying opportunities ahead. To that point, their EPS growth is still enticing, but fiscal 2025 and FY26 earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline for Amazon and Apple over the last 30 days.That said, at their current levels, Amazon and Apple stock should offer long-term value to shareholders as they currently land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, a further decline in EPS estimates could lead to a sell rating, while a significant uptick could lead to a buy rating, but may not be plausible at the moment, given their somewhat underwhelming guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4a86ef008094b:0-buy-sell-or-hold-these-mag-7-stocks-after-earnings-aapl-amzn/
Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Meta Platforms vs. Microsoft: Which AI Superpower is a Better Buy?,1747335600000,"Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies. Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month. Microsoft is now extending Copilot’s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft. Since April 2, Microsoft shares have appreciated 18.6% while Meta Platforms returned 12.8%.META and MSFT Stock’s PerformanceMETA & MSFT’s Earnings Estimate Revisions PositiveThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for META’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.52 per share, up by 2.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 6.96% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and ConsensusMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 2% to $13.30 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 12.71% growth over 2024.Microsoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteBoth META’s and MSFT’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. Meta Platforms’ average surprise of 17.3% is better than Microsoft’s surprise of 5.21%, reflecting good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: META is Cheaper Than MSFTBoth Meta Platforms and Microsoft are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Meta Platforms shares are trading at 8.57X, lower than Microsoft’s 10.9X.MSFT and META Valuation  ConclusionAlthough both Microsoft and Meta Platforms are leveraging AI to boost their prospects Microsoft is better positioned compared with META given strong adoption of Copilot, Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business.Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Meta Platforms, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Standout Magnificent 7 Stock: Microsoft's Quiet Dominance,1746468000000,"Over the past two weeks, most of the Magnificent 7 have reported earnings, and the results were broadly positive, reinforcing the strength and scale of these market leaders. Last week brought reports from Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), while the prior week featured Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA).Among them, one company quietly stood above the rest: Microsoft.Microsoft’s earnings results aren’t the only thing prompting me to highlight the stock either—MSFT also boasts the highest Zacks Rank of the Mag 7 group, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been the best performing stock over the last one month, three months and year-to-date of the group.Microsoft Cloud Growth Leads Amazon and AlphabetMicrosoft’s cloud business was the clear standout this quarter. Azure revenue grew 33% year-over-year , which was the fastest among the three major cloud providers, with AI services alone contributing 12 percentage points to that growth. The broader Intelligent Cloud segment reported $26.8 billion in revenue, up 21% from the prior year, with operating income reaching $11.1 billion.By comparison, Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted revenue of $29.3 billion, maintaining its lead in scale but growing just 17% , it marked the slowest pace of growth in five quarters. While AWS remains highly profitable, with a record 39.5% operating margin, the slowdown raises questions about whether it's ceding growth momentum to competitors.Google Cloud also delivered strong results, with revenue up 28% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Operating income came in at $2.2 billion, a significant improvement from $900 million a year ago, showing continued progress toward profitability.Taken together, these results highlight Microsoft’s continued leadership in enterprise cloud and its growing advantage in AI infrastructure — both key drivers of long-term value. Azure’s faster growth rate not only reinforces Microsoft’s competitive edge, but also reflects its broader strategic positioning in what remains one of the most critical areas of tech spending.MSFT Stock has Less Tariff Risks Than AAPL, META and AMZNAs US–China trade tensions rise, tariff exposure has become a key risk factor for large-cap tech investors. Among the Magnificent 7, Microsoft is uniquely positioned, not only due to its strong fundamentals, but also because of its relatively low exposure to China and tariff-related disruptions.Apple stands out as one of the most vulnerable. The company’s reliance on Chinese manufacturing for iPhones, iPads, and other hardware makes it especially sensitive to rising import costs and potential supply chain snarls. A significant portion of Apple’s revenue also comes from Chinese consumers—a market that could easily be affected by retaliatory measures.Amazon faces its own set of challenges. While its core North American business remains robust, the company’s global retail supply chain depends heavily on low-cost manufacturing hubs in China. Tariffs on goods shipped to the US from China could squeeze margins or complicate logistics for its sellers.Meta Platforms is less directly exposed to supply chains but faces its own geopolitical and macro risks. The company has long been restricted in China, but it still relies on global ad spending from brands with supply chains and customer bases in the region. In a deteriorating US–China trade environment, global advertising spend could weaken, affecting Meta’s growth.Microsoft, by contrast, benefits from a business model centered around software, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise services, which are less vulnerable to tariffs or localized trade friction. Its supply chain exposure to China is limited, and its revenue is globally diversified, with much of its growth coming from the US, Europe, and emerging AI-driven demand.Magnificent 7 Valuations Appear FairMicrosoft currently holds the highest earnings multiple among the Magnificent 7, but that premium may be well-earned. While MSFT trades above its peers, it remains in line with its five-year median earnings multiple and so do Apple and Meta, which suggests that valuations are fair from a historical perspective.The rest of the group is trading well below their five-year averages, a welcome development for valuation-conscious investors after the sharp run-ups in recent years. Importantly, these valuations come alongside healthy earnings growth forecasts, which range from 12.8% annually for Apple to as high as 24.7% for Nvidia. Microsoft is expected to grow its earnings 14.6% annually over the next three to five years.With Microsoft’s strong competitive positioning, durable growth, and relatively low macro risk, its premium multiple appears justified, however, most of the Magnificent 7 stocks appear attractively valued.Should Investors Buy Shares in MSFT?Microsoft continues to stand out as a well-rounded member of the Magnificent 7—delivering top-tier cloud growth, strong earnings momentum, and relatively low exposure to macro and geopolitical risks. Its premium valuation appears justified given its leadership in AI and enterprise business, and its stock performance reflects growing investor confidence.While many of its peers also look attractively valued after recent pullbacks, Microsoft remains a compelling core holding for long-term investors seeking stability, growth, and resilience in an uncertain market.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:49ab18d3a094b:0-the-standout-magnificent-7-stock-microsoft-s-quiet-dominance/
Meta's Upside Jumps Nearly 40% as Loop Capital Raises Target,1747929393000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META gained fresh momentum after Loop Capital lifted its price target to $888 from $695, while keeping a Buy rating, according to a Thursday research note.The new forecast implies about 40% upside from current levels, reflecting the firm's confidence in Meta's growth trajectory.Loop Capital highlighted Meta's leading position among non-hardware beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, suggesting the stock may outperform its Magnificent Seven peers this year. Sanderson also pointed to Meta's stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter outlook as a key driver.Earlier concerns that reduced ad spending by China-based retailers would drag on revenue have eased. Meta confirmed in April that some Chinese online merchants cut back ads on Facebook and Instagram amid President Donald Trump's trade policies toward China. However, advancements in AI tools and services have helped offset those headwinds, according to Loop Capital.Despite broader market volatility, the bullish call underscores growing optimism around Meta's ability to monetize its AI investments and sustain ad revenue growth. Investors will watch the company's upcoming earnings report for further clues on whether Meta can meet heightened expectations and validate its lofty valuation.Is META Stock a Buy?Based on the one year price targets offered by 60 analysts, the average target price for Meta Platforms Inc is $706.21 with a high estimate of $935.00 and a low estimate of $466.00. The average target implies a upside of +11.13% from the current price of $635.50.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Meta Platforms Inc in one year is $531.47, suggesting a downside of -16.37% from the current price of $635.50",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:9ca087414094b:0-meta-s-upside-jumps-nearly-40-as-loop-capital-raises-target/
AppLovin Stock Plunges 26% in 3 Months: Is it a Smart Investment Now?,1747326660000,"AppLovin Corporation APP has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry’s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet GOOGL shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms META has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP’s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin’s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP’s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.

Nvidia Can Count On Tech Giants' Spending as 'Tough Regulations' Hit China Sales — Barrons.com,1746462660000,"By Angela PalumboSpending on artificial intelligence by so-called hyperscalers should continue to benefit Nvidia, helping to offset the damage from restrictions on chip exports, Melius Research says.All of the Magnificent Seven companies except for Nvidia have reported their most recent financial results this earnings season. A common theme was that regardless of uncertainty about the economic outlook, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet all plan to continue spending big on AI.That is a good sign for Nvidia, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a research note on Monday.""The AI race is particularly existential for hyperscalers as each seeks some form of 'Universal Assistant' that can do it all (Project Astra for Google, MetaAI, Copilot) and ultimately corral more ad, cloud and subscription revenues,"" Reitzes wrote. He said that even if the hyperscalers, as the tech giants are known, make their own custom semiconductors, he believes spending on Nvidia's chips needs to ""grow rapidly,"" to help them achieve their goals.""Nvidia has some amazing new products (GB300 and Vera Rubin), which should drive growth even amidst tough regulations,"" he added.Nvidia shares have dropped 15% this year, compared with a 3.8% decline in the S&P 500. Part of the reason is concern over tighter U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya wrote on Monday that as a result of the rules, Nvidia could be facing a 20% reduction in the long-term $500 billion total addressable market for its hardware.""We learned that $15-$20 billion of run-rate sales (about 10% of Data Center segment) into China have evaporated — so upside in Hyperscaler capex in 2025 and 2026 is even more important now,"" Reitzes wrote.He maintained his Buy rating on Nvidia and $150 price target, which implies a 31% increase to the stock's closing price of $114.50 on Friday. Shares of Nvidia were down 0.8% on Monday to $113.52.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Deutsche Bank and Caesars Entertainment have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1746453000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 5, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Deutsche Bank DB as the Bull of the Day and Caesars Entertainment CZR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Dell Technologies DELL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:With many analysts turning bullish on European equities, it's noteworthy that Deutsche Bank stock was recently added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list.Landing the Bull of the Day, Deutsche Bank’s Zacks Banks-Foreign Industry is currently in the top 4% of over 240 Zacks industries. For those who haven’t noticed, Deutsche Bank’s American Depositary Receipt (ADR) has been one of the top performers this year, soaring over +50% in 2025 while the broader indexes work out of correction territory in regard to U.S. markets. Trading at 52-week highs of $26 a share, there could still be more upside for Deutsche Bank stock based on a pleasant trend of earnings estimate revisions. High Sentiment for European EquitiesWith sentiment improving regarding concerns over tariffs and economic uncertainty, European markets have been resilient. Goldman Sachs (GS), for instance, sees strong corporate earnings in Europe and higher defense spending as a major catalyst. This comes as there has reportedly been a record rotation of global investors shifting away from U.S. equities and increasing their European stock holdings.Notably, Deutsche Bank analysts have shifted to a positive outlook on other European stocks, based on improved market conditions and reduced geopolitical tensions. Despite the European Union (EU) not being immune to higher tariffs from Washington, many pundits have pointed out that their biggest trade partners are still each other.Deutsche Bank’s Outlook As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, Deutsche Bank’s steady expansion has kept investors engaged. Being the largest bank in Germany, Deutsche Bank’s total sales are expected to be up 7% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to increase another 2% in FY26 to $35.39 billion.More intriguing and relating to Goldman Sachs' bullish commentary on European equities is that Deutsche Bank’s annual earnings are currently slated to soar 116% this year to $3.20 per share, compared to EPS of $1.48 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to rise another 11%.Positive EPS RevisionsExtending Deutsche Bank’s rally has been rising earnings estimate revisions. As shown below, FY25 EPS estimates (F1) have risen 9% over the last 60 days and are now up 23% from a year ago. Even better, FY26 EPS estimates (F2) have popped 14% in the last two months and have increased 26% over the last year.Conclusion & Final ThoughtsDeutsche Bank’s selection as the Bull of the Day is not to say that investors should shift away from U.S. equities, but it wouldn’t be surprising if the rally in DB continued with shares still trading at 8X forward earnings and less than 1X sales.Furthermore, diversification is an effective hedge against economic uncertainty, and Deutsche Bank is worthy of consideration outside of the renowned U.S. banks that typically catch investors' attention.Bear of the Day:As U.S. markets work their way out of correction territory, consumer sentiment has still dropped significantly in recent months, and some Leisure and Recreation services companies may take the brunt of the hit.One such company could be casino and resort operator Caesars Entertainment, with its stock having a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and landing the Bear of the Day. Caesars Q1 Earnings MissReporting its Q1 results last Tuesday, Caesars Entertainment posted a much wider adjusted loss than expected at -$0.54 a share compared to estimates of -$0.19. This was despite Q1 sales of $2.79 billion topping expectations of $2.78 billion. Still, Caesars Entertainment has missed top and bottom-line expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports, which has raised investors' concerns.Caesars Dismal Stock PerformanceYear to date, Caesars Entertainment’s stock is down 17% to trail the S&P 500’s -5% and has lagged its Zacks Leisure & Recreation Services Market’s -13%. More concerning, CZR has now plummeted more than 50% in the last three years.Declining EPS RevisionsUnfortunately, more downside risk could be ahead for Caesars Entertainment’s stock as earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline following the company’s lackluster Q1 results.Over the last quarter, fiscal 2025 EPS estimates have now sunk 70% from estimates of $1.25 per share to $0.37. Although Caesars Entertainment’s EPS growth may look intriguing, FY26 earnings estimates have fallen 40% from three months ago, from $2.17 a share to $1.28.Bottom Line Based on its very dismal stock performance and the steep decline in earnings estimate revisions, it’s best to avoid Caesars Entertainment’s stock for now. To that point, the consumer discretionary sector will likely feel the effects of any further economic uncertainty, and there could be less demand for non-essential recreational activities.mAdditional content:Buy, Hold or Sell AMD Ahead of Q1 Earnings?Advanced Micro Devices is set to release its first-quarter 2025 results on May 6.AMD expects first-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.1 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and a sequential decline of approximately 7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD's first-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.12 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 30.11%. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 93 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The earnings estimate indicates growth of 50% on a year-over-year basis.AMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.32%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar).Let's see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.AMD's Data Center & Client Segment Revenues to Grow Y/YAMD's first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from growth in both its data center and client segments, driven by continued demand for its EPYC processors and Ryzen chips. The data center segment, in particular, has been a major contributor to AMD's success, and the company expects this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.AMD expects the Data Center segment's revenues to significantly increase, driven by the strong sales of its data center chips that support hyperscalers and power AI and Generative AI applications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Data Center revenues is pegged at $3.4 billion, indicating an impressive year-over-year surge of 47.5%.The company is likely to see continued growth in its client business, driven by higher demand for Ryzen processors across desktop and mobile platforms. AMD's collaborations, such as the one with Dell Technologies for Ryzen Pro processors in commercial PCs, are expected to have bolstered growth in this segment in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Client segment revenues is pegged at $2.04 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 49.3%.Weak Embedded & Gaming to Hurt AMD's Q1 ResultsAMD's near-term prospects suffer from weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments. On a year-over-year basis, these segments' revenues are expected to have declined.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Embedded revenues is pegged at $570 million, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming revenues is pegged at $509 million, suggesting a massive 38.1% decline.AMD Stock Underperforms Sector & IndustryAdvanced Micro Devices shares have lost 17.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's decrease of 9% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry's decline of 7.2%.AMD stock is not so cheap, as its Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales, Advanced Micro Devices is currently trading at 4.68X, higher than the Computer – Integrated Systems industry's 2.90X.AMD Benefits from Rich Partner BaseAMD benefits from a rich partner base, which includes Microsoft, Oracle, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo, Meta Platforms and IBM having Instinct platforms in production.The demand for AI accelerators like the Instinct MI300 series, especially from hyperscalers, is expected to continue growing, further boosting data center revenues in the first quarter of 2025. In the Data Center AI business, MI300X deployment increased with cloud partners, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, IBM, Digital Ocean and Dell Technologies, among others.Meta Platforms used MI300X to power its Llama 405B frontier model on meta.ai. It added instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads.Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services. IBM announced plans to enable MI300X on its Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications.Dell Technologies started offering MI300X as part of its AI factory solution suite. DELL is providing multiple ready-to-deploy containers through its Dell Enterprise Hub on Hugging Face.ConclusionAMD's expanding portfolio and strategic acquisitions are expected to have improved its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter amid weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments, and fierce competition from NVIDIA.AMD has a Growth Score of C, which makes it unattractive for growth-oriented investors. Stretched valuation is another concern.AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

Wall Street futures slip after three-day rally as traders await Powell speech,1747307739000,"US stock futures edged lower Thursday after three straight days of gains, as markets digested a temporary truce in U.S.-China tariff tensions and eyed fresh economic data for clues on inflation and growth. All eyes now turn to US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to speak at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C., on May 15. Powell faces mounting pressure from President Trump, who has been openly urging the Fed to begin cutting interest rates.Futures linked to the S&P 500 were down 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.7 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also declined, falling 128 points, or 0.3 percent.Also read: Told Apple CEO Tim Cook that I don't want him to build in India: Donald TrumpThe cautious mood followed news that Washington and Beijing have paused their tit-for-tat tariff war, easing some pressure on equities. Confidence in the near-term market outlook got a further lift earlier this week from promising US inflation data and signs of resilient tech momentum.Among individual names, Foot Locker shares skyrocketed over 68 percent after a Wall Street Journal report suggested Dick’s Sporting Goods is nearing a $2.3 billion acquisition deal for the footwear retailer. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth dropped 6 percent following reports of a Justice Department probe—although the company said it has not been notified of any such investigation.Tech giants continued to lead the rally this week. Nvidia and Tesla have jumped more than 16 percent, while Meta Platforms has surged 11.3 percent. Amazon and Alphabet also notched gains of more than 8 percent.

On a year-over-year basis, headline inflation slowed to 2.3 percent, just below the anticipated 2.4 percent, reinforcing hopes of easing price pressures.Attention now shifts to Thursday’s release of the Producer Price Index (PPI)—a measure of wholesale inflation. Economists expect the headline PPI to rise 0.3 percent month-on-month in April, with the core figure, which excludes food and energy, also forecast to increase 0.3 percent.Investors will also parse through retail sales, industrial production, and weekly jobless claims data, all scheduled for release before the market opens.

"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta ",1747295340000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 15, 2025 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues.""Making Sense of the Evolving Earnings PictureNote: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates. - We continue to believe that this earnings season was less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the evolving macroeconomic and public policy backdrop. To that end, management commentary has largely been reassuring despite the uncertainty. - Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been under pressure, with bigger declines in estimates compared to other recent post-COVID periods. That said, estimates for the Tech sector have notably stabilized lately. - For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. Q2 estimates have been steadily coming down, with the magnitude and breadth of negative estimate revisions greater than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.What’s Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates?The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariff uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have declined since the quarter began.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.4% in Q2 on +9.8% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed course in recent weeks, as we have been flagging lately.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector’s estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector’s Q2 estimates at least proves that the shift to the annual growth pace isn’t solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly from the Mag 7 players. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company’s current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.You can rest assured that we will be closely monitoring the Tech sector’s revisions trend in the days ahead.The Earnings Big PictureWhile estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven’t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy’s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and Microsoft",1746451080000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 5, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Microsoft Corp. MSFT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Should You Hold NVIDIA as Meta & Microsoft Double-Down on AI?NVIDIA Corp. stock gained nearly 2.5% on Thursday, buoyed by a renewed wave of optimism from two of its largest customers, Meta Platforms, Inc. and Microsoft Corp. . Both tech giants reaffirmed, and in Meta Platforms' case, raised their capital expenditure commitments toward AI infrastructure.This resurgence of AI-related investment could mark a key turning point for NVIDIA stock, which has pulled back 27% from its 52-week high of $153.13 attained on Jan. 7, 2025. With the renewed optimism about AI investment, the question arises: Should investors rush to buy more, or is holding the stock the smarter move right now?AI Spending Spree Could Reignite Demand for NVIDIA's ChipsMicrosoft, a major cloud provider and longtime NVIDIA partner, confirmed during its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call that it will maintain its massive $80 billion capital expenditure plan for AI data centers, with more than half of that directed toward U.S. operations.Meanwhile, during its first-quarter 2025 earnings call, Meta Platforms increased its 2025 capital spending outlook to a range of $64-$72 billion, up from the prior $60-$65 billion range. The added spending will primarily go toward expanding data center capacity and AI infrastructure, both heavily reliant on NVIDIA's high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).Meta Platforms' CFO, Susan Li, made it clear that the CapEx bump is driven by AI ambitions and infrastructure upgrades. Similarly, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood indicated that fiscal 2026 investments will grow, albeit at a slower pace, and be more closely aligned with short-term revenue gains, implying accelerated AI workload deployments.These commitments are strong signals that NVIDIA's chips, especially its H100 and upcoming B100 GPUs, will remain in high demand as hyperscalers scale their AI platforms.AI Boom Driving NVIDIA's Financial PerformanceNVIDIA's products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues from the data center end-market grew 93% year over year to $35.58 billion and contributed 90.5% to the total sales.AI-driven workloads, cloud computing expansion and increasing enterprise adoption of AI models have turned NVIDIA's high-performance chips into a necessity rather than a luxury. With businesses aggressively investing in AI infrastructure, NVIDIA remains positioned at the heart of this technological transformation.Financially, NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues surged 78% year over year, while non-GAAP EPS climbed 71%. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance of $43 billion in revenues represents a staggering increase from $26.04 billion in the prior-year quarter.Analysts expect NVIDIA to maintain this momentum, forecasting fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenue growth of 48% and 24%, respectively. With earnings projected to rise 42% in fiscal 2026 and 27% in fiscal 2027, NVIDIA's long-term investment case remains intact. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.9%.NVIDIA Overvaluation Warrants a CautionValuation-wise, NVIDIA is overvalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of D.However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, NVDA shares are trading at 13.32X, higher than the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry's 10.96X.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowNVIDIA's stock may be off its highs, but the AI megatrend is very much alive and is receiving fresh fuel from the likes of Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Their deep-pocketed commitments to AI infrastructure spending underscore NVIDIA's strategic importance in the evolving tech landscape. However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility. For now, holding the stock is the smartest approach.Currently, NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.43 billion people daily. Meta Platforms' growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth.Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>> )Shares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past year (+34.9% vs. +23.5%). The company's first-quarter 2025 results reflected solid capital markets performance and loan demand. Business expansion efforts, decent loan demand and higher rates support net interest income (NII). We expect NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3% by 2027.While a solid resurgence in deal-making activities is likely to take time, a solid pipeline will drive the Investment Banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to witness a CAGR of 2.1% by 2027. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth.The Zacks analyst estimate for the metric shows a 6.2% fall in 2025. As it invests in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain high. Our estimates for non-interest expenses imply a CAGR of 2.9% by 2027.

Strategic buyouts help it achieve cost synergies that are in sync with its aim of generating long-term value for shareholders. It is well-poised for growth due to accelerated digitization in the U.S. residential mortgage industry.Intercontinental Exchange also engages in the effective deployment of capital.

"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H. Cho***Classes and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.Young people are also managing their finances in new ways. Generative artificial intelligence can take on the tedious task of budgeting, and the growing buy-now-pay-later industry grants the power to purchase almost anything in installments.MarketWatch spoke with money experts who offered advice on how to use the latest finance tools responsibly, and to remind graduates not to forget these tried and true personal finance habits.For more on this, read here.- Genna Contino***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert Steiner, Callum Keown This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Britain tells antitrust regulator to focus on economic growth,1747263660000,"Britain on Thursday told its antitrust regulator to get behind its push for economic growth and minimise uncertainty for businesses by making more timely, transparent and responsive interventions in merger control, digital markets and consumer protection.Since taking power last year, the Labour government has stepped up pressure on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and other regulators, demanding they play their part in tearing down barriers that hold back growth.The CMA is independent but it follows a ""strategic steer"" set by the secretary of state for business. ""Our economic regulators are crucial to creating the conditions for increased growth and investment,"" Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said in a government statement. ""This steer sets out the government's priorities for the CMA."" Reynolds signalled the CMA's new steer in February , saying it needed to be ""less risk-adverse"". The CMA gained new powers to scrutinise ""big tech"" companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon at the beginning of this year, adding to a widened remit to police mergers after Brexit.Prime Minister Keir Starmer singled the CMA out last year as a regulator that needed to take economic growth more seriously. The government reinforced the point by making former Amazon executive Doug Gurr interim chair of the CMA in January.CMA CEO Sarah Cardell said the government had situated a strong competition regime ""squarely in the context of the growth mission"".""The steer provides helpful clarity on how the CMA should prioritise and go about our work, promoting competition and protecting consumers with a sharp focus on supporting higher levels of investment and economic growth,"" she said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RM28Z:0-britain-tells-antitrust-regulator-to-focus-on-economic-growth/"
"Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",1746447000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 5, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL.Earnings Remain Resilient, but Outlook SoftensThe market loved the Microsoft and Meta Platforms results, liked parts of the Amazon report, but didn't like the Apple numbers. With these reports, we now have Q1 results from 6 members of the 'Magnificent 7' group.The aggregate growth numbers for the group are impressive, but there is a considerable variance among the Mag 7 players. The year-over-year earnings growth rates range from -56.8% at Tesla, +4.8% from Apple, +42.6% from Amazon, and +46% from Alphabet.The companies are sticking with their capex plans, which has remained a sticking point with market participants in recent quarters. The DeepSeek shock notwithstanding, they all see continued spending on building out their AI infrastructure as critical to their long-term competitive positioning. For some, like Alphabet's Google search franchise, is seen as under threat in the emerging AI world, and the company remains determined to defend its territory.Amazon, the leader in the cloud space, showed decelerating growth, which they pinned on capacity constraints in its datacenter assets. Revenues in the cloud business (Amazon Web Services) were up +16.9% to $29.3 billion, just a hair below consensus estimates. This is down from +18.9% year-over-year growth in AWS revenues in the preceding period (2024 Q4) and +19.1% in the quarter before that (2024 Q3).In other words, a steady decelerating growth trend in the cloud unit's revenues. The deceleration in Amazon's cloud revenues was expected and also in line with what we had seen from Alphabet. Revenue growth trends for Microsoft's cloud business were much better compared to what we saw from Alphabet and Amazon.We suspect that some in the market had been hoping that Amazon's cloud revenues would show the type of growth momentum that we saw from Microsoft. Amazon's cloud numbers aren't bad, but they aren't great.Amazon's modestly lowered Q2 earnings guidance wasn't tariffs-related, but rather a function of the timing of certain operating expenses. The company's revenue guidance aligned with consensus expectations, spotlighting the resilience of the company's business model in this challenging operating environment. This is particularly so on the retail side, where roughly half of the sellers on the site are based in China, and even the other half that are domestically based source a significant proportion of their inventory from that market. Looked at this way, Amazon's Q2 guidance is fairly reassuring.Of these Mag 7 players, Apple had the most pronounced tariff impact, with June quarter gross margins impacted by about 100 basis points. Given the all-around uncertainty, the company didn't provide a lot of color on the period. For the March period, Apple's earnings increased +4.8% on +5.1% higher revenues.Apple's underperformance has more to do with its China exposure than anything else. The company has good plans in place to shift iPhone assembly to India, particularly for shipments to the U.S. market. But the stock's performance suggests that the market remains skeptical of the plan's success.The other aspect of the company's exposure to China is the market's position as a significant contributor to revenues and earnings. To that end, Apple is not only faced with regular competitive pressures from local rivals, but also has to contend with its status as an American consumer brand in a Chinese environment when local consumers may be less inclined to patronize it on nationalist grounds.Please note that estimates for the Mag 7 group have started coming under pressure lately after remaining very strong over the last two years. The better-than-expected Q1 earnings results have helped reverse this negative trend, at least for now. Today's +11% earnings growth expected this year is up from +9.9% earnings growth expected last week, but down from +15.7% that was expected three months ago.Please note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 23.9% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2025, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 18.3% in 2023. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 30.6% weight in the index. If this group of mega-cap companies was a stand-alone sector, it would be the second biggest in the S&P 500 index, just behind the Technology sector at 38.7% and above the Finance sector at 13.5%.Key Earnings Reports This WeekWe have over 1300 companies on deck to report results this coming week, including 94 S&P 500 members.The bellwethers reporting this week range from Ford, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Uber, DoorDash, and many others. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q1 results from more than 90% of the index's total membership.Q1 Earnings ScorecardThrough Friday, May 2nd, we have seen Q1 results from 358 S&P 500 members or 71.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 358 index members are up +13.4% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 72.6% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.The EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 72.6% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78.8% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The revenue beats percentage is also tracking below the 20-quarter average, but by a larger amount.Estimates Come Under PressureLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 358 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period.We noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further as companies report results and talk up the extent of uncertainty around their near-term business outlook.Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. The ongoing market weakness is essentially a reflection of these diminished earnings expectations.Estimates for full-year 2025 have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the negative revisions trend becoming very meaningful and widespread since mid-February 2025.Estimates have been cut for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Aerospace and Construction as the only sectors enjoying modest positive revisions since mid-February. Sectors suffering the biggest cuts to estimates since mid-February include Transportation, Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, Tech, Finance, and others.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Earnings Expectations Shift Lower: A Closer LookWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Making Sense of the Evolving Earnings Picture,1747263180000,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates.- We continue to believe that this earnings season was less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the evolving macroeconomic and public policy backdrop. To that end, management commentary has largely been reassuring despite the uncertainty.- Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been under pressure, with bigger declines in estimates compared to other recent post-COVID periods. That said, estimates for the Tech sector have notably stabilized lately.- For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. Q2 estimates have been steadily coming down, with the magnitude and breadth of negative estimate revisions greater than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.What’s Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates? The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariff uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. The chart below shows how Q2 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the start of the year.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have declined since the quarter began.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.4% in Q2 on +9.8% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed course in recent weeks, as we have been flagging lately. You can see this reversal in the sector’s revisions trend in the chart below.This favorable turn in the Tech sector’s revisions trend can be seen in expectations for full-year 2025 as well, as the chart below shows.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector’s estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector’s Q2 estimates at least proves that the shift to the annual growth pace isn’t solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly from the Mag 7 players. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company’s current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.You can rest assured that we will be closely monitoring the Tech sector’s revisions trend in the days ahead.The Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q1 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis.While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven’t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy’s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e7a8f21e4094b:0-making-sense-of-the-evolving-earnings-picture/
"Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold AppLovin Stock Before Q1 Earnings?",1746446160000,"AppLovin Corporation APP will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 7, after the bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1.45, indicating 116.4% growth from the year-ago reported quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues stands at $1.38 billion, implying 30.2% year-over-year growth. There has been no change in analyst estimates or revisions lately.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an earnings surprise of 23.5%, on average.Q1 Earnings Beat Seems Unlikely for APPOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for APP this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.APP has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Software Platform Should Drive Performance GrowthWe expect year-over-year improvement in the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter to be driven mainly by an increase in the Software Platform. The consensus estimate for the Software Platform revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion, indicating 54.3% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for Appsrevenuesis pegged at $331.7 million, suggesting a 12.7% year-over-year decline.The consensus mark for the Software Platform’s adjusted EBITDA is pegged at $829.4 million, suggesting 68.6% year-over-year growth. APP’s adjusted EBITDA is expected to decrease 16.8% year over year.APP Stock is in a Great MoodAPP has rallied a staggering 300% over the past year, easily outpacing the broader industry's 27% gain. In contrast, competitors like Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META have delivered mixed results. Alphabet shares slipped 2% during the same time frame, highlighting weakness in parts of its ad-driven business. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms climbed 29%, benefiting from its strong position in social media advertising. Both Alphabet and Meta Platforms remain major players, but AppLovin’s specialized platform is delivering superior returns in this niche.Investment Risk and Rewards for APPAppLovin's recent financial results underscore its strong fundamentals and impressive growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the fourth quarter of 2024, revenues surged 44% year over year and 14% sequentially, reflecting strong market demand. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 78% year over year and 17.5% sequentially, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 248% from the prior year and 38% sequentially, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability.For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency. Looking ahead, management has guided for $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025 sales, slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 billion. Historically, AppLovin has consistently beaten earnings expectations, increasing the likelihood of another outperformance.However, potential risks persist. The growth in the in-game advertising segment may face challenges, and the uncertain impact of the company’s ventures outside gaming could introduce volatility. Nonetheless, AppLovin's strategic focus on innovative technology and expansion within the gaming industry positions it well for sustained growth. With AXON 2.0 driving operational efficiencies and a diversified approach to revenue generation, the company is poised to maintain its growth momentum, making it an attractive option for long-term investors.Hold RecommendationThe stock has delivered exceptional growth over the past year, with the company showing robust financial results driven by its Software Platform and AXON 2.0 technology. While first-quarter 2025 earnings are expected to show strong year-over-year growth, the absence of a positive Earnings ESP and modest decline in App revenues suggest potential volatility. Still, APP’s consistent earnings beats, operational efficiency, and leadership in mobile advertising make it a compelling long-term play. Given near-term uncertainty around earnings and potential sector risks, a Hold is prudent as investors await clearer post-earnings direction and sustained performance confirmation.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e324b107c094b:0-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-applovin-stock-before-q1-earnings/
$30B AI Opportunity: Will It Power Meta’s Next Surge?,1747864260000,"Magnificent Seven giant Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META has been no stranger to Wall Street analyst upgrades lately. After the company’s last earnings report, nearly 20 analysts tracked by MarketBeat increased their price targets on the stock. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] More recently, analysts at Wolfe Research issued a substantial  price target update on Meta of $750. This implies a significant potential upside in Meta shares of nearly 18% from its May 20 closing price.Mark Zuckerberg recently shared five key AI growth opportunities for the company. This makes an earlier piece of Wolfe's research particularly relevant. Wolfe has referenced the huge growth potential of one opportunity that Zuckerberg mentioned: business messaging. It sees business messaging as a possible $30–$40 billion opportunity for Meta.Zuckerberg's recent comments suggest that business messaging might help Meta hit Wolfe's $750 12-month price target. This analysis will break down Meta’s ambitions in business messaging and show just how powerful they could be for the tech stock.Over a Third of the World Population Is Using WhatsAppAside from Facebook and Instagram, Meta also owns possibly the world’s most-used direct messaging app, WhatsApp . In Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated that WhatsApp has over 3 billion monthly active users . That is equal to around 38% of the world’s population of 8 billion. Zuckerberg also said that more than one billion people use Facebook Messenger every month.Additionally, users send just as many messages on Instagram each day as they do on Messenger. He summed up this massive user count and activity data by saying, “So, Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.""It looks like Meta is gearing up to start aggressively monetizing its huge messaging user base. This could kick off the path toward Meta executing on Wolfe’s massive total addressable market revenue estimates in this space. Wolfe estimates that Meta is only generating around $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue from WhatsApp. That lines up with Meta’s latest earnings. Meta's Other Family of Apps Revenue, which houses WhatsApp, generated around $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. It also generated $510 million in revenue last quarter, growing by 34% from a year ago.Wolfe’s Estimates Indicate a Huge Opportunity for MetaAlthough the timeline around which Wolfe sees Meta achieving $30–$40 billion in business messaging revenue is uncertain, it could clearly be a huge growth driver for Meta. At the midpoints of Wolfe’s estimates , this would mean a 20x increase in Meta’s business messaging revenue . Additionally, $35 billion in business messaging revenue would be equal to over 20% of the $170 billion that Meta generated in the last 12 months. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Meta intends to increase the monetization of business messaging using AI. Zuckerberg envisions every company using an "" AI business agen t."" This agent handles customer service and runs sales campaigns through direct messaging. Meta would then presumably charge companies to do this through its messaging apps.Meta has already seen companies in Thailand and Vietnam using its messaging apps to aid their business. However, they use humans to do so because the cost of labor in those countries is low. The company believes that the use of AI agents can make doing this profitable in developed countries.However, Meta’s focus on monetizing AI in developed countries is somewhat curious. Only around 100 million of WhatsApp’s 3 billion monthly active users are in the United States. Additionally, data shows that most WhatsApp users are in emerging economies. If these economies already have low labor costs, will AI agents really change the adoption of business messaging? While they might not make a difference in whether business messaging is profitable overall in these countries, there is a solid chance they could  raise profitability , thus increasing adoption. This remains to be seen, as Meta is currently testing these AI features. Additionally, an amount of 100 million users is still around 30% of the population in the United States, meaning there is a big opportunity at home as well.With Proper Execution, Business Messaging Could Be Meta’s Next Big HitOverall, Meta’s business messaging ambitions should be a key area of focus for investors going forward. However, it seems reasonable to pump the brakes on Wolfe’s huge forecasts in this area until more tangible results for Meta’s AI agents surface. If successful, business messaging represents a huge possible growth opportunity for one of the most dominant technology names in the world.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:dd1dc9895094b:0-30b-ai-opportunity-will-it-power-meta-s-next-surge/

Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings.

The company also continues to reward shareholders, which adds to the stock’s appeal. While acquisitions have expanded its product range and geographic reach, they have increased the company’s balance sheet debt as well. However, weakness in the Industrial Automation segment, due to lower demand for smart energy and thermal solutions, is worrisome.

Acquisitions have been pivotal in ADP’s ability to operate across borders. Automatic Data Processing pursues buyouts that complement the overall business mix. This stock is an eye candy for dividend-seeking investors. The recent rise in the current ratio suggests a robust liquidity position for the company. Meanwhile, rising expenses due to acquisitions and investments are worrisome and can affect profitability. Automatic Data Processing faces high competition, which shoots talent costs sky-high and can affect the company’s growth.

CoreWeave: Riding the AI Wave Ahead of Earnings,1747229520000,"What Does CoreWeave Do?In simple terms, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock CoreWeave ( CRWV ) is an AI cloud-computing company that functions as a massive computer rental platform, providing super-powered services for artificial intelligence operations and other resource-intensive tasks. The late 2022 launch of OpenAI and Microsoft’s ( MSFT ) ChatGPT chatbot illustrated how significant AI technology is and is likely to become when it became the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Since then, big-tech, “Magnificent 7” companies like Meta Platforms ( META ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars of CAPEX on data centers and the GPUs that are necessary to train large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.Coreweave, founded in 2017, initially provided data center capability to Bitcoin miners. However, a crypto crash would alter the company’s trajectory the next year forever. Instead of focusing on crypto, CoreWeave’s management team correctly predicted that the next (and much larger) wave of data center demand would come from AI. Thus, the company pivoted, and growth exploded.CoreWeave: The Biggest Tech IPO Since 2021In late March, CoreWeave launched its IPO, raising $1.5 billion. While the $1.5 billion was lower than CoreWeave wanted to raise and below Wall Street’s expectations, context is critical. The market conditions at the time were dire, with an intensifying trade war between the world’s two largest economies. In most cases, a tech company would simply shelf its IPO. More importantly, China’s DeepSeek large language model had just launched and claimed to provide a ChatGPT-like product with far less compute.CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator would later say that demand had actually picked up in the wake of the DeepSeek madness. Later, Wall Street analysts would also debunk DeepSeek’s claims. Despite the uncertainty and investor skittishness, CRWV management forged ahead and launched the IPO, marking the largest tech IPO in years.CoreWeave: The Google 2004 PrecedentFamed investor Jesse Livermore once proclaimed, “There is nothing new on Wall Street. There can’t be, because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market has happened before.” While history doesn’t always repeat exactly, it does tend to rhyme.In 2004, GOOGL launched its IPO. GOOGL shares would more than triple in a year, and would never look back. Now, CRWV exhibits some of the same characteristics, including:· IPO U-turn Base:In 2004, GOOGL shares spiked in their first few sessions, fell, and finally carved out a short, multi-week rounded base, which I call an IPO “U-turn” base.Image Source: TradingViewCRWV’s current chart pattern mirros the 2004 GOOGL IPO and should act as a valuable precedent for investors.Image Source: TradingView· Explosive Revenue GrowthIn the year prior before its IPO, Google’s revenue jumped from $961.90 million to $2.7 billion. Meanwhile, CoreWeave’s revenue grew at a blistering 725% in the year prior to its IPO.· Institutional SponsorshipDeep-pocketed institutional investors drove Google’s mind-boggling ascent, and now they are doing the same for CoreWeave. For instance, Nvidia ( NVDA ), the undisputed AI leader, owns 6% of CRWV. According to its latest filing BlackRock ( BLK ), the world’s largest asset manager, owns 250,000 shares. Meanwhile, Fidelity disclosed a 9% stake in the firm earlier this week.· New Technology WaveGoogle benefitted from riding the technological wave known as the internet. Now, CRWV is riding the newest and arguably fastest-growing wave in history: artificial intelligence.Fib Targets CRWVCorewWeave will report earnings after the close today, May 14th. If the company impress Wall Street, the Fibonacci targets are much higher.Image Source: TradingViewBottom LineAs CoreWeave prepares to unveil its earnings report, the echoes of Google’s historic IPO and the robust institutional backing paint an optimistic picture for this AI cloud-computing pioneer.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2452d0f2e094b:0-coreweave-riding-the-ai-wave-ahead-of-earnings/
Forget 'Sell in May': 5 Factors Why Wall Street ETFs Could Rally Ahead,1746435060000,"Wall Street has seen a strong start to May 2025, going against the old adage, “sell in May and go away,” after a subdued April . In April, the S&P 500 lost 1.8%, the Dow Jones retreated 3.7%, the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.9%, and the Russell 2000 plunged about 4%.However, U.S. stocks are showing signs of a recovery to start May, marking a significant comeback for major indexes, led by a strong jobs report and a possible breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations.Longest S&P 500 Winning Streak Since 2004The S&P 500 jumped nearly 1.5% on May 3, 2025, surpassing its April 2 closing level — referred to by President Trump as “Liberation Day,” when sweeping tariffs were announced. The S&P 500 marked its longest winning streak since November 2004, closing higher for multiple sessions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4% on May 3, logging its ninth consecutive winning day. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite also climbed roughly 1.5% on Friday. We expect this to be the start of a market recovery, which we can see throughout this month.Weekly Market PerformanceFriday’s Wall Street rally capped off a strong week for U.S. equities. The Dow rose 3%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a 3.4% gain. Optimism over Big Tech earnings and signs of progress in trade discussions were key drivers of the weekly surge.Below, we highlight a few factors that suggest May could be a charged-up month for Wall Street.Recent History Didn’t Favor the “Sell in May” AdageLarry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. “Historically, if we go back over the past ten years, 'sell in May' hasn't actually worked too well.”The phrase ""Sell in May and go away"" began in London, where traders would exit markets in summer and return after the Saint Leger horse race in September — a strategy that became popular in the United States from 1960 to 1987.However, after the 1987 market crash, staying invested through summer generally became more profitable. While the S&P 500 has averaged just 1.8% returns from May to October since 1950, it has still posted gains 65% of the time, challenging the need for seasonal exits, per LPL Financial data, quoted on Yahoo Finance.April Job Report Beats ExpectationsMarkets were buoyed by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, exceeding economists’ expectations of 138,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, signaling continued strength in the labor market despite recent volatility tied to tariff fears.Hopes Rise for U.S.-China Trade TalksInvestor optimism was further fueled by news from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry indicated openness to talks, saying the ""door is open"" for negotiations if the United States agrees to scale back reciprocal tariffs. This development suggested a possible thaw in trade tensions that had rattled markets in April.Tech Giants React to Tariff PressuresDespite strong earnings, some tech giants felt the pressure of trade uncertainty. Apple AAPL reported a $900 million tariff headwind this quarter and cut its share buyback program by $10 billion, causing its stock to dip. Amazon AMZN posted solid earnings but offered cautious guidance, citing tariffs and trade policy as key concerns.While such concerns may instigate the administration to take a softer stance on trade deals, some tech giants came up with upbeat outlooks even in this strained scenario.Strong outlook from software giant Microsoft MSFT and Facebook parent Meta Platforms META spread strong optimism in the tech sector.Meta boosted AI Spending as advertising outlook appeared “healthy” despite tariff concerns. Meta shares posted its strongest week since February 2024. Microsoft too expects capital expenditures to rise from here as the company continues to expand data center capacity as the cloud and AI can benefit every business’s growth. Microsoft shares soared over 11% last week, marking its best performance since March 2023.Meanwhile, Alphabet GOOGL also plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to expand on its artificial intelligence strategy.The figure beat the $58.84 billion that Wall Street expected, according to FactSet, as quoted on CNBC.Trump's April Tariff Revenues SurgeTariffs under President Trump had a tangible impact last month, with the U.S. government collecting over $17.4 billion in Customs and Certain Excise Taxes in April. That figure nearly doubled March’s total of $9.6 billion, marking a sharp rise and far surpassing the smaller revenue spikes observed earlier in Trump’s presidency. The biggest tariffs — 10% duties on nearly every country in the world — took effect on April 5.While this can be a short-term boost, a decent increase in tariff revenues is probably guaranteed at this level. Plus, Trump’s believe that “the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax” could be a long-term benefit for corporations and consumers.ETFs to BuyAgainst this backdrop, investors can buy a few top-ranked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have higher chances of outperforming amid the new-found optimism.iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV – Up 14.8% Past Month (as of May 3, 2025)This is a high-momentum fund and should benefit from the ongoing AI boom.

What Big Tech Earnings Taught Us — and Didn't — About Tariffs — Barrons.com,1746421200000,"By Angela PalumboSix of the Magnificent Seven have reported their financial results this earnings season, giving investors some much-needed insight into how the world's largest tech companies are being impacted by tariffs.Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Apple have all reported earnings over the last two weeks, making Nvidia the only Mag Seven company left.Heading into earnings season, the tariffs put in place by the Trump administration raised concerns that companies would increase their prices to offset the levies, leading to a pullback of consumer and enterprise spending — and a potential recession.So far, the results have only told Wall Street that tech ""companies are just as confused as everybody else,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Barron's.""Most of them are having a difficult time parsing out how tariffs will affect them, partially because it's a moving target,"" he added. ""They don't necessarily know how it's all gonna end.""Apple gave the clearest insights into how it could be impacted. CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call Thursday that the company expects to take a $900 million hit from tariffs for the June quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon, another massive consumer-facing brand, said it is closely monitoring the effect of tariffs, while doing ""everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense.""Tesla withheld second-quarter guidance as the company measures the ""impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains.""The rest of the Mag Seven was mostly quiet on the topic, with Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft providing better-than-expected guidance with mentions of macro uncertainty.One trend has emerged, however — a slowdown in ad spending. Alphabet and Meta are starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back budgets since the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption. That exemption previously allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs.Chinese companies Shein and Temu — known for their low priced items — may not want to put as much money into advertising if consumers stop spending because of price increases.But while advertising strength is now in question, software remains a haven for tech investors. Enterprises are still spending on artificial intelligence powered software meant to lower costs and increase productivity down the line.""It's pretty clear where the tariffs can be applied on real world goods. But, when it comes to services — and a lot of these big software companies are moving more towards software as a service — they're not as exposed to tariffs,"" Sosnick said.For the most part, investors can breathe a sigh of relief that tech companies remain on solid ground. But as trade policy continues to evolve, it's clear uncertainty will be sticking around.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"To Win Monopoly Fight, Meta Is Touting a Rival: TikTok — WSJ",1746356400000,"By Dave MichaelsWASHINGTON — Weeks into an antitrust trial that threatens the future of Meta Platforms' social-media empire, the company's best bet for a court victory might lie with one of its rivals: TikTok.The Federal Trade Commission is seeking to break up Meta, alleging that it wields an illegal monopoly originally built more than a decade ago through Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. To prevail, the agency needs to show not only that Meta engaged in unlawful monopolization, but also that its dominance hasn't waned since. That is where TikTok comes in.The FTC has been methodically presenting evidence to support its claim that Meta has muscled out most competition in the market for consumers who use social media to connect with friends and family. Meta has sought to undercut that claim by arguing that the social-media marketplace has evolved into a form of entertainment and news. In today's world, Meta says, TikTok's short-form video platform is a formidable rival. That position has scored some points.Under questioning Wednesday from a Meta lawyer, a senior TikTok executive testified that his company isn't like Instagram and Facebook.""We are an app and we have social features, but I don't think of us as a social app,"" said Adam Presser, TikTok's head of operations.Meta's lawyers then highlighted a series of internal TikTok analyses that muddied the waters. ""YouTube and Instagram are TikTok's most important competitors,"" one management document from 2021 said.They cited other records as well. ""The short-video interfaces on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube are now virtually indistinguishable,"" TikTok told an Australian government agency in March.TikTok has added social features, such as a friends tab, that make it feel more like a social-networking product, noted Meta lawyer Aaron Panner.Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, in his own appearance on the witness stand last month, said Instagram and Facebook have become more like TikTok, moving from social networking to ""more of a broad discovery-entertainment space.""Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, mostly testified in support of the FTC's case. But he also made a similar observation about the transformation of social media.""The current horizon of the products is all about entertaining users with video content,"" Systrom told the court. ""Facebook certainly and TikTok certainly and Instagram certainly. And I'll give you one more, which would be YouTube.""The FTC maintains that Facebook puts personal connections at the heart of the experience. Some of Meta's internal documents introduced in court by the FTC, such as survey data, show that people mainly value Facebook and Instagram for keeping up with friends and family.TikTok, on the other hand, relies on an algorithm that determines which videos to show. The algorithm doesn't really care whether the user knows the person who made the video , according to Presser and other witnesses. The point is to keep the user engaged with the app.U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is deciding the case without a jury, hasn't revealed much about his views so far, though some of his questions have suggested he isn't an avid user of social media.He has sometimes questioned whether the different social-media platforms are really all that different, noting that they have many of the same features.""Why isn't the way these are used now just a difference in degree?"" Boasberg asked one FTC witness.The commission is expected to continue presenting its case for at least another week. It has spent a majority of its time so far attempting to establish that Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp for the express purpose of neutralizing them as potential competitors.FTC's lawyers have entered into evidence dozens of internal Meta emails and presentations that portrayed Zuckerberg and other executives as deeply worried that Instagram and mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp would erode Facebook's business and put it at a particular disadvantage on mobile devices.Before it bought WhatsApp in 2014, for instance, Meta foresaw mobile messaging apps, which were particularly popular in Asia, as invading its social networking turf.""Can you guys compile a this-sh — -is-getting-scary deck given all of the data we have now?"" Javier Olivan, now Meta's chief operating officer, wrote in one email.Even after Zuckerberg bought Instagram in 2012, he struggled with how much to promote the photo-sharing app, worried that its growth could cannibalize Facebook, according to testimony from Systrom. Meta denied its request for more resources to support video, spam-fighting, and data safety in 2018, when Instagram passed one billion users, Systrom said.Systrom said his app could have grown into a formidable competitor to Facebook if it had remained independent. But under questioning from one of Meta's lawyers, he acknowledged that Meta's support fueled its rapid growth between 2012 and 2018.""We grew much more quickly because we were part of Facebook than we would have as an independent company,"" Systrom said.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250504000194:0/

In terms of the forward 12-month P/E, Alphabet shares are trading at 16.26X, while Amazon is trading at 31.44X. Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to absorb roughly 50% of the projected global ad spending by 2028.P/E Ratio (F12M)Although higher tariffs and a prolonged trade war have the potential to hurt digital advertising spending, negatively impacting prospects, we believe Meta Platforms’ AI focus is a key catalyst. Meta Platforms’ focus on leveraging AI to improve user engagement is noteworthy. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement. Amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Meta Platforms shares have appreciated 9.2% year to date, outperforming the broader sector as well as peers, including Alphabet and Amazon, shares of which have dropped 4.9% and 16.3%, respectively.META Stock’s PerformanceMETA shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.META Shares Trade Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs  META Leverages AI to Boost Advertising RevenuesMeta Platforms focuses on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA NVDA. The deployment of META’s deep neural network on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip across Instagram and Facebook applications has achieved more than 6% recall improvement to the retrieval system while delivering over 8% ad quality improvement on selected segments. Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that was used on Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months. META’s growing focus on social commerce through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is noteworthy. In first-quarter 2025, WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions contributed to deliver 34% year-over-year growth in Family of Apps other revenues, reaching $510 million.META’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward MovementThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.84 per share, up by 3.2% over the past 30 days, indicating a 13.18% year-over-year increase.META’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.30%. Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and Consensus Meta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote Here’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right NowAI usage is making META a popular name among advertisers as well as users.However, operating expenses are expected in the $114-$119 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Generative AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs, make the stock a risky bet.META is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by its Gen AI initiatives and core business. Although these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe the lack of monetization of new platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. The company doesn’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. Meta Platforms plans to focus on scaling and deepening engagements for Meta AI over the next few years.META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

BIG MONEY POLL — Barron's,1746235800000,"Thirty-two percent of respondents are bearish on the outlook for stocks over the next 12 months, the highest percentage since at least 1997. On the other hand, nearly 75% of the survey participants say their weighting in fixed-income assets is higher than six months ago, and 70% say they are bullish on bonds. By Paul R. La MonicaAmerica's money managers are more bearish today than they have been in nearly 30 years. Barron's latest Big Money poll of professional investors finds 32% of respondents bearish on the outlook for stocks over the next 12 months — the highest percentage since at least 1997.Just think about all the crises investors have weathered since then: the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the 2008-09 financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic. And yet the Big Money pros are more anxious now than during any of those painful points for the financial markets, the economy, and the country.The bulls' ranks also stand at historic levels in our spring survey — historically low, that is. Just 26% of respondents call themselves bullish on the market's prospects, the smallest percentage since 1997.A full 50% of managers were bullish last fall, while only 18% were bearish. The change in sentiment largely reflects worries about the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on corporate earnings and the economy. Although President Donald Trump has softened his stance since announcing tariff hikes on April 2, and has shown a willingness to make deals with both traditional allies and China, the managers remain concerned about the possibility of a global trade war.""Trump may have overplayed his hand on tariffs,"" says Harris Nydick, managing member and co-founder of CFS Investment Advisory Services in Totowa, N.J. ""This is one of the top five times in my career for fog and murkiness. There are so many unknowns.""The S&P 500 index has fallen about 4% this year after two years of double-digit gains. Tariff worries are only partly to blame, however. Equity valuations were unsustainably high at the start of the year, and investors' concentrated bets on beneficiaries of artificial-intelligence technology were rocked in late January when China's DeepSeek revealed an AI model built more efficiently, and at far lower cost, than U.S. models.Although stocks have rebounded from the lows reached after Trump's tariff announcement, the Big Money managers think more selling may be in store. Some 58% say the stock market is overvalued, while 38% call stocks fairly priced. Only 4% say the market is undervalued.The managers' clients are even more pessimistic than the pros; 56% say their clients are bearish.Bill Smead, founder and chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Phoenix, calls this ""one of the craziest junctures for the markets"" that he has ever seen. ""We needed to unwind growth-stock mania, "" he says, but adds that the tariff news led investors to ""slaughter things that should do better,"" namely industrial and consumer stocks that have been hit hard by trade-war concerns.Barron's conducts the Big Money poll twice a year, in the spring and fall, with the help of Erdos Media Research in Ramsey, N.J. The latest poll was mailed out in late March, with supplementary tariff-related questions added in early April. The spring survey drew 119 respondents.The optimists expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to end the year about 4% to 7% above recent levels, based on their mean forecasts. But the bears see a 7% decline for the Dow and low-double-digit losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Forty-two percent of respondents describe themselves as neutral in the latest poll.Only 20% of Big Money managers indicate they approve of Team Trump's tariff policy, while about 80% put the odds of a tariff-related recession at 40% or higher. Still, 60% consider the market's tariff-related tempest a buying opportunity.Several respondents lamented the fact that the White House isn't focusing on policies that might spur more immediate growth. ""I hope the administration begins to take a look at the process of deregulation,"" says John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, based in New York.He isn't alone: 38% of poll respondents say deregulation ought to be the administration's top economic priority this year.Simply put, much of the optimism about a second Trump administration unleashing animal spirits on Wall Street has evaporated since stocks surged shortly after Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in November.""Companies are frozen; CEOs are wondering if they should play the long game or short game,"" says Matthew Neyland, chief investment officer at SK Wealth Management in Providence, R.I. ""There are things that could be done to make the mergers and acquisitions process easier that would help.""Neyland says banks might be willing to lend more if they had more flexibility with regard to capital requirements. At the same time, ""burdensome reporting"" regulations make it more complicated for public companies to do business and have led more companies to stay private, he says.Deregulation and tax-cut extensions may be coming, but Trump has given the market ""the spinach first,"" says Eric Green, chief investment officer at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia. Green says he expects ""more shoes to drop"" before the market selloff is over.He also expects a rebound in M&A activity, but notes that companies don't want to announce major transactions until there is more clarity about tariffs. ""They've been overwhelmed by tariffs,"" he says of the White House and Congress. ""Everything else might be happening, but slowly. It's a matter of time.""What is the biggest risk the stock market will face in the next six months? Among survey respondents, 24% cite an economic slowdown, 19% say a recession, and 14% say political turmoil in the U.S. Carter Randolph, CEO of the Randolph Company in Cincinnati, is the sole poll participant who sees no chance of a recession in the next year. Although investor and business sentiment hasn't been good, consumer spending has held up, he says, adding that ""sentiment isn't a good investment tool.""But others aren't as dismissive of widespread worry on Wall Street and Main Street. Joe Gilbert, a portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management in Rocky River, Ohio, says the economy looks to be headed toward a downturn. ""Tariffs have caused things to come to a standstill,"" he says. ""It makes it tough to have confidence, and confidence is fuel for the economy, so a recession is more likely than not.""The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Wednesday that gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, fell at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, largely due to a surge in imports ahead of the implementation of tariffs. Real GDP grew 2.4% in last year's fourth quarter.Economic concerns are a big reason for gold's record-breaking rally this year. Bullion has gained almost 27% year to date, to a recent $3,312 an ounce. Gold is often viewed as a defensive holding, a commodity with currency-like qualities that performs well when the dollar is weakening. The Big Money managers are fans: 58% say they are bullish on gold.Oppenheimer's Stoltzfus says he thinks it's fine for investors to own a little gold, noting the price has gotten a boost largely due to buying by the central banks of China, India, and other emerging markets seeking to diversify beyond the dollar. But Tom Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, says gold miners might be a better play.Forester's fund owns Agnico Eagle Mines and Alamos Gold. Both are trading below their five-year average forward price/earnings multiples, he says, and are benefiting from lower oil prices, which reduces costs. Both are Canadian companies.Many Big Money participants say they are looking beyond the U.S. for better values this year, with 70% calling themselves bullish on non-U. S. stocks. Charles Zhang, founder and president of Zhang Financial in Portage, Mich., tells Barron's that he likes both developed and emerging market stocks, and favors the iShares MSCI EAFE Value exchange-traded fund and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF. ""The U.S. dollar is weaker; that and a stronger euro are helping international stocks,"" he says.Zhang, No. 1 in the Barron's ranking of independent advisors , also sees potential for Chinese stocks to keep rising, noting that Alibaba Group Holding and other leading Chinese stocks still look reasonably priced. Alibaba is up more than 40% year to date but trades for just 13 times the next 12 months' expected earnings.Better prices elsewhere, coupled with frustration about U.S. trade policies, have led some investors to throw in the towel on U.S. assets. ""Some clients are apoplectic,"" says Sandra S. Martin, managing director of Martin Investment Management, which has offices in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and Evanston, Ill. She says some of the firm's Asian clients are now focusing more on international stocks.It isn't all doom and gloom in the investment world. A volatile start to 2025 has created better buying opportunities in some stocks that had become too rich. ""The average investor needs to think for the long term, "" says Joseph Parnes, president of Technomart Investment Advisors in Baltimore. He calls himself a contrarian, and bullish. ""You should take advantage of downturns, and within two to three years we should see solid growth,"" he says.Sharon Hill, a senior portfolio manager at Vanguard, likes dividend-paying stocks, particularly in the banking and pharmaceutical industries, and especially as bond yields retreat. ""High-yielding stocks are already more attractive as a safety play,"" Hill says.She expects volatility in the bond market to make them even more so.Many Big Money men and women are upbeat about the outlook for bonds. Nearly 75% of the survey participants say their weighting in fixed-income assets is higher than six months ago, while 70% say they are bullish on bonds. ""There is still value in bonds,"" says Erica Snyder, CEO of Hunter Associates, with offices in Pittsburgh and Salem, Ohio. ""We see the Federal Reserve stepping in to cut interest rates a little bit a few times this summer.""Rate cuts could put more downward pressure on the 10-year Treasury yield, which has fallen in recent months to a current 4.17%. Sixty-two percent of Big Money respondents expect the 10-year yield to be 4% or lower a year from now.Lower bond yields are a boon to risk assets, prominently including equities. Jose Medeiros, a managing partner at Stonerise Capital Partners in San Francisco, likes the prospects for Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Alphabet. ""Tech isn't a fad; it is a growing part of the global economy, and that isn't going to change,"" he says. ""Tech companies are growing earnings at a much faster rate than the broader market, with much higher margins and better cash-flow generation. Tech stocks should trade at higher multiples on that alone.""John Maffei, chief investment officer at MFM Capital Management in Orlando, Fla., says he has been ""looking to scoop up values,"" particularly dividend payers, as the market has fallen. ""The selloff in some stocks has been overdone with this market volatility,"" he says, adding that his clients aren't panicking.Still, 2025 is likely to remain a year of surprises. And if subsequent quarters mirror the first, investors could be in for a tumultuous ride. ""It is a difficult market,"" says Ken Laudan, manager of the Buffalo Blue Chip Growth fund. ""You have to be comfortable being very uncomfortable.""If the Big Money managers are preparing for more market turbulence, the rest of us should be, too.Write to Paul R.

Google’s smart glasses bet with Warby Parker could also benefit this other eyewear maker,1747834192000,"Google’s renewed push into the smart glasses market through new partnerships with Warby Parker and luxury fashion group Kering will also benefit EssilorLuxottica- the company behind Ray-Ban smart glasses made with Meta- and accelerate the broad adoption of smart glasses, analysts say. Both Warby Parker and Kering, in separate announcements on Tuesday, said they are working with Google to develop glasses embedded with artificial intelligence, using Android XR, a version of the Android operating system tailored for headsets and glasses.The collaboration with Warby Parker is particularly significant as Google is investing up to $75 million in the company’s product development and commercialization costs.The companies plan to unveil their first product line after 2025, with a series of offerings expected to follow.The two partnerships signal Google’s broader strategy to re-enter a market it helped pioneer, but exited early. Google Glass was once at the forefront of wearable innovation but was eventually shelved due to privacy concerns and tepid consumer interest.Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba described the Google-Warby partnership as a “dream scenario” and predicted rapid expansion of the smart glasses category. “We expect smartglasses growth to be exponential over the next few years, particularly given the product is squarely at the intersection of wearable technology and AI,” he wrote.Deal could accelerate adoption of smart glassesInvestor response to the announcements was swift. Warby Parker shares closed up 16% at $20.34 on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism that the collaboration could mark a turning point for the company’s growth. Shares of Innovative Eyewear, a smaller smart glasses maker, rose 12% to $3.02. Meanwhile, Vuzix, another competitor in the space, fell 3% to $2.46.Jefferies analysts said Google’s partnership with both Warby Parker and Kering to develop artificial intelligence-powered glasses could help accelerate the adoption of smart glasses.They said that Warby Parker is less influential than EssilorLuxottica, the eyewear which with its partner Meta, leads the smartglasses category.“However, seeing established companies work on smart glasses suggests they might become mainstream soon,” they add. Deal validates the success of EssilorLuxottica and Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glassesThe renewed interest in smart glasses comes as demand for AI-integrated wearables appears to be rising. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently reported a surge in demand for Ray-Ban smart glasses, with 2 million units sold by the end of 2024. A new model is expected to launch later this year.Equita Sim analyst Domenico Ghilotti said EssilorLuxottica should benefit from Google’s partnership as the move validates the success of Meta and EssilorLuxottica’s offering and underlines the growing importance of smart eyewear as a channel for deploying consumer AI. “The deal signals the expected reaction of players like Google to the commercial success of Ray-Ban smart glasses, which EssilorLuxottica develops with Meta Platforms,” Ghilotti says. It marks “a confirmation of the growing relevance of this product for the penetration of AI solutions,” the analyst adds.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:b340422be094b:0-google-s-smart-glasses-bet-with-warby-parker-could-also-benefit-this-other-eyewear-maker/
Review & Preview: How Coke Beat Pepsi — Barron's,1746235800000,"By Evie LiuCoca-Cola and PepsiCo shares have been on different paths this year. Coke is up 15%, easily beating the S&P 500's 2.9% decline, while Pepsi is down 12%. That is counterintuitive because, while rivals, they are often lumped together.Coca-Cola beat expectations on first-quarter earnings and revenue this past week. ""Earnings season has given investors little to get excited about,"" says Kevin Grundy, senior research analyst at BNP Paribas Exane. ""In contrast, Coca-Cola continues to hit on all cylinders and stands out fundamentally within the group."" Coke shares are Grundy's top pick. The stock is trading at 25 times earnings expected for the next 12 months, making it only 15% more expensive than its peers in packaged food and beverages. Grundy thinks Coke can ""trade at a wider premium.""Coca-Cola is primarily a soda company, though it also sells juice, milk, coffee, and tea. While Pepsi is best known for soft drinks, it has a big presence in snack food, from Lay's chips to Quaker oatmeal. Pepsi has been under pressure as consumers snack less or shift to healthier alternatives, says RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi. Coca-Cola soda sales, meanwhile, haven't been affected much by recession fears and weight-management drugs.The two also have different international exposure: The U.S. makes up 40% of Coca-Cola revenue, 60% for Pepsi. That means Pepsi is more at risk if U.S. consumer spending weakens.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsIt was the week that marked President Donald Trump's first 100 days.

Tap Mag-7 ETFs on Temporary US-China Trade Truce,1747133160000,"The group of tech giants — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta  META — known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" has been battered by the tariff turmoil.  Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF  MAGS has lost 6.4% so far this year (as of May 12, 2025) against a loss of 0.3% seen in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.The latest U.S.-China temporary trade truce came as a surprising relief to the space. Responding to the trade deal, MAGS ETF surged 5.8% on May 12. The ETF has, in fact, surged 12.9% over the past month.The recent rebound follows a rough period for Big Tech after President Donald Trump announced a ""reciprocal tariff"" plan on April 2, which wiped out $2 trillion in cumulative market cap from the Magnificent Seven.Mag-7 Stock Performance Highlights Post US-China Trade TruceAmazon and Meta Platforms spearheaded a significant rally among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks on May 12 afternoon, following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China.Stock Performance Highlights Amazon surged 8.1% and Meta climbed 7.9% on May 12. Tesla gained 6.8%, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion. Apple rose 6.3%. NVIDIA jumped 5.4%. Google shares increased 3.4%. Microsoft added 2.4%.Trade Truce DetailsThe United States agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on Chinese imports. The United States cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered American levies from 125% to 10%.These reductions will last 90 days, following two days of high-stakes talks between the two nations. The new tariffs on small packages sent from China worth up to $800 have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement.Bullish Outlook for Tech SectorThe trade development is highly optimistic for tech stocks, particularly due to the easing of supply-chain concerns. Along with Apple, Tesla is also heavily dependent on Chinese parts and battery suppliers. No wonder, both shares surged. Moreover, Tesla is expected to debut its self-driving Taxi in June.Impact of China on Big TechAmazon : 30% of product value on its platform comes from China; Chinese advertisers made up 14% of ad revenues in 2024, per Raymond James, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Meta : Chinese advertisers contributed roughly 11% of total ad spending, Raymon James noted.Google : Chinese advertisers accounted for about 6% of ad revenues, Raymon James indicated.Apple : 90% of iPhones are manufactured in China, representing 17% of 2024 revenues .NVIDIA : Chinese clients make up between 20% and 40% of the company’s end customer base, according to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Any Wall of Worry?Despite the temporary truce, the United States has imposed export bans on NVIDIA’s H20 AI chips to China, which has pressured NVDA shares. Hence, many are of the view that the phase of group-wide Mag-7 rallies appears to be over, replaced by a more scrutinized stock selection. However, no one still underrates the opportunities in the Mag-7 group.ETF PicksAnd if you want to go for group-wide picks, you have options like MAGS,  Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF  MGK,  Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF  XLG and  iShares S&P 100 ETF  OEF to play on.Meta-heavy ETFs like Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF  FCOM can be played for specific stock preference. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY invests about 35% of its basket in Amazon and Tesla.While tensions are still present around chip restrictions (H20/NVDA), the stock cannot be ignored due to continued chip demand. So, keep a close look at the NVDA-heavy Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF  SHOC.And if you like the resilience in MSFT shares and the recent rebound in the Apple stock, you can tap iShares Global Tech ETF IXN. The ETF also invests about 35% of its portfolio in the duo.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:518920b92094b:0-tap-mag-7-etfs-on-temporary-us-china-trade-truce/

Tech Trader: The AI Trade Is Showing New Life. Take It From Big Tech. — Barron's,1746235800000,"By Tae KimDuring a stretch of just 36 hours this past week, we learned more about the state of tech tariffs and artificial intelligence than perhaps we had in all three months prior. That's thanks to a quick succession of earnings from Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com.While all four companies reported better-than-expected earnings, the stock reactions following their results underscored that, in a global trade war, digital bits win over atoms. Shares of Microsoft and Meta Platforms both surged following their results, while Apple and Amazon underperformed.Apple CEO Tim Cook said tariffs would add about $900 million to the company's costs for the June quarter. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company had yet to see significant impact from the levies.That said, both Apple and Amazon sell many physical products and couldn't give much clarity about the potential tariff impact for the rest of the year.Beyond tariffs, the reports offered an important update on artificial intelligence: The reports of its demise have been greatly exaggerated.Heading into earnings season, some on Wall Street were worried that companies would reduce their plans to spend hundreds of billions to build out AI infrastructure this year. Concern about return on investment, combined with economic weakness, led some to think the big AI spending trend was done. Not even close.In fact, spending is actually picking up. The fundamental story around AI hasn't changed. AI demand continues to accelerate beyond expectations. And the so-called hyperscalers all still plan to invest aggressively.On Wednesday, Microsoft said it was increasing European data center capacity by 40% over the next two years, putting to bed speculation that the software giant was cutting back overseas. The company also reaffirmed its prior guidance to spend $80 billion on data center capacity this fiscal year ending in June.Microsoft said it has been capacity-constrained for Azure AI services, meaning the company doesn't have enough AI GPU servers to meet demand. Microsoft said it would remain supply-constrained beyond June, which is longer than management expected. That is clear evidence of robust AI demand from enterprises.In the biggest surprise of the week, Meta went a step further than Microsoft and boosted its already hefty 2025 capital expenditures forecast to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion versus a prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion. And that still may not be enough.Even with its increase in AI computing capacity, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company doesn't have the resources to meet the demand of its internal AI projects.On the earnings call with investors, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out a clear vision for five areas where he sees big opportunity for AI: improved advertising outcomes; new types of interactive content; a WhatsApp for customer support and sales; voice conversation and more personalized recommendations; and, finally, better devices. Zuckerberg sees a huge number of people wearing AI-enabled glasses within five to 10 years.""We don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI,"" Zuckerberg said, using the shorthand for return on investment. ""But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.""Similarly, Amazon sees potential for AI to transform all parts of its operations. It's already using AI to improve productivity in fulfillment, e-commerce, and advertising. ""We're not dabbling here,"" Jassy said on the earnings call. ""As fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed.""Jassy said the company's AI business was growing at more than 100% year over year, a figure that would be higher with more capacity. Jassy sounded especially optimistic about the potential for AI agents, which are programs with the ability to take simple directions and complete multistep tasks.Jassy cited two start-ups using agents to code that are suddenly significant Amazon Web Services customers, the type of demand that wasn't foreseen even a few months ago.""I would say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the first inning. It is so early right now,"" Jassy said.Of course, a prolonged trade war could change everything. Sales at large technology companies would eventually be affected as consumer spending and enterprise tech budgets all deteriorate.Even then, AI might thrive. In times of uncertainty, smart companies with long-term horizons invest to gain market share. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that if there is a recession, companies would shift more investment toward AI because it's an area with the most promise and a source of potential efficiencies.Zuckerberg agrees. During downturns, ""I'm going to do things like build out even more GPU infrastructure to serve businesses and people better,"" he said in a Stratechery podcast interview this past week.AI increasingly looks like a once-in-a-generation paradigm shift for computing. Even a recession may not bring it to a halt.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250502008847:0/
Meta Shares Rise as Tariff Overhang Clears for Asia-Based Advertisers — WSJ,1747088280000,"By Meghan BobrowskyMeta's stock had a good day.Shares of the Facebook parent closed up nearly 8% after President Trump said the U.S. and China reached a deal to temporarily roll back tariffs. The social-media giant's chief financial officer said last month that the company had seen reduced ad spending from Asia-based e-commerce retailers in April. More than 10% of Meta's revenue came from China in 2024.Mark Mahaney, head of Evercore ISI's Internet research team, said the stock was up because uncertainty with its China business was the main tariff concern the company mentioned on its most recent earnings call.""The only area of weakness they called out was China-based advertisers,"" he said.The de minimus loophole--an exemption that previously waived tariffs on packages coming into the U.S. whose goods were valued at $800 or less--was closed earlier this month and remains closed. Retailers in China had previously taken advantage of the loophole.It is unclear how the closing of the loophole has affected or will continue to affect Meta's business.This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college. If they choose not to go to college, the trust will remain till they reach 21.

"Earnings Remain Resilient, but Outlook Softens",1746223740000,"The market loved the Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META results, liked parts of the Amazon AMZN report, but didn’t like the Apple AAPL numbers. With these reports, we now have Q1 results from 6 members of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group.The aggregate growth numbers for the group are impressive, but there is a considerable variance among the Mag 7 players. The year-over-year earnings growth rates range from -56.8% at Tesla, +4.8% from Apple, +42.6% from Amazon, and +46% from Alphabet.The chart below shows the group’s blended Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to what was achieved in the preceding period and what is expected in the coming three periods.The companies are sticking with their capex plans, which has remained a sticking point with market participants in recent quarters. The DeepSeek shock notwithstanding, they all see continued spending on building out their AI infrastructure as critical to their long-term competitive positioning. For some, like Alphabet’s Google search franchise, is seen as under threat in the emerging AI world, and the company remains determined to defend its territory.Amazon, the leader in the cloud space, showed decelerating growth, which they pinned on capacity constraints in its datacenter assets. Revenues in the cloud business (Amazon Web Services) were up +16.9% to $29.3 billion, just a hair below consensus estimates. This is down from +18.9% year-over-year growth in AWS revenues in the preceding period (2024 Q4) and +19.1% in the quarter before that (2024 Q3).In other words, a steady decelerating growth trend in the cloud unit’s revenues. The deceleration in Amazon’s cloud revenues was expected and also in line with what we had seen from Alphabet. Revenue growth trends for Microsoft’s cloud business were much better compared to what we saw from Alphabet and Amazon.We suspect that some in the market had been hoping that Amazon’s cloud revenues would show the type of growth momentum that we saw from Microsoft. Amazon’s cloud numbers aren’t bad, but they aren’t great.Amazon’s modestly lowered Q2 earnings guidance wasn’t tariffs-related, but rather a function of the timing of certain operating expenses. The company’s revenue guidance aligned with consensus expectations, spotlighting the resilience of the company’s business model in this challenging operating environment. This is particularly so on the retail side, where roughly half of the sellers on the site are based in China, and even the other half that are domestically based source a significant proportion of their inventory from that market. Looked at this way, Amazon’s Q2 guidance is fairly reassuring.Of these Mag 7 players, Apple had the most pronounced tariff impact, with June quarter gross margins impacted by about 100 basis points. Given the all-around uncertainty, the company didn’t provide a lot of color on the period. For the March period, Apple’s earnings increased +4.8% on +5.1% higher revenues.The chart below shows the performance of Microsoft (up +5.3%), Meta (down -14.5%), Amazon (down -16%) and Apple (down -16.1%) relative to the Zacks Tech sector (down -12.3%) and the S&P 500 index (down -9.1%).Apple’s underperformance has more to do with its China exposure than anything else. The company has good plans in place to shift iPhone assembly to India, particularly for shipments to the U.S. market. But the stock’s performance suggests that the market remains skeptical of the plan’s success.The other aspect of the company’s exposure to China is the market’s position as a significant contributor to revenues and earnings. To that end, Apple is not only faced with regular competitive pressures from local rivals, but also has to contend with its status as an American consumer brand in a Chinese environment when local consumers may be less inclined to patronize it on nationalist grounds.The chart below shows the Mag 7 group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Please note that estimates for the Mag 7 group have started coming under pressure lately after remaining very strong over the last two years. The better-than-expected Q1 earnings results have helped reverse this negative trend, at least for now. Today's +11% earnings growth expected this year is up from +9.9% earnings growth expected last week, but down from +15.7% that was expected three months ago.The chart below of aggregate full-year 2025 dollar earnings shows how this aggregate total has evolved over the past six to seven months.Please note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 23.9% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2025, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 18.3% in 2023. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 30.6% weight in the index. If this group of mega-cap companies was a stand-alone sector, it would be the second biggest in the S&P 500 index, just behind the Technology sector at 38.7% and above the Finance sector at 13.5%.Key Earnings Reports This Week We have over 1300 companies on deck to report results this coming week, including 94 S&P 500 members.The bellwethers reporting this week range from Ford, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Uber, DoorDash, and many others. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q1 results from more than 90% of the index’s total membership.Q1 Earnings ScorecardThrough Friday, May 2nd, we have seen Q1 results from 358 S&P 500 members or 71.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these 358 index members are up +13.4% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 72.6% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates for these index members in a historical context.The comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.As you can see here, the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 72.6% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78.8% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The revenue beats percentage is also tracking below the 20-quarter average, but by a larger amount.Estimates Come Under PressureLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 358 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period.The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2025 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters.We noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further as companies report results and talk up the extent of uncertainty around their near-term business outlook.Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. The ongoing market weakness is essentially a reflection of these diminished earnings expectations. The chart below shows how expectations for the current period have evolved since the start of the year.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.Estimates for full-year 2025 have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the negative revisions trend becoming very meaningful and widespread since mid-February 2025.Estimates have been cut for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Aerospace and Construction as the only sectors enjoying modest positive revisions since mid-February. Sectors suffering the biggest cuts to estimates since mid-February include Transportation, Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, Tech, Finance, and others.The chart below shows how full-year 2025 earnings growth expectations have evolved in recent weeks.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Earnings Expectations Shift Lower: A Closer LookThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c2958d3d8094b:0-earnings-remain-resilient-but-outlook-softens/
"U.S., Chinese Markets Cruise on Cooling Trade Tensions",1747087260000,"Monday, May 12, 2025Markets posted one of its strongest sessions of 2025 so far. We’ve had a volatile first half of the year, and we might expect that volatility to continue. But with all the ups and downs, today’s big day into the green has brought the S&P 500 within 5% of its all-time trading high. The Dow and S&P 500 are within 1% of posting profits year to date.The Dow shot up 1160 points today, for a +2.81% gain — and it was the laggard among the major indexes. The S&P 500 grew +184 points, +3.26%. The Nasdaq, which one the day on strength in tech stocks, was up a whopping +779 points, +4.35%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained +68 points, +3.40%.Of course, the catalyst for this seismic shift comes from the agreement between the U.S. and China to pause their reciprocal tariffs (which had ballooned to +145% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and +125% on U.S. exports to China). Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META were both up +8% today, leading the way for “Mag 7” stocks.Chinese stocks also saw a bounce today, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining +3% today, for its best trading day since March. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar is back up to its one-month high, and Gold — which had been a demonstrative hedge when the equities market was melting away, just a few short weeks ago — is down -3% today.What to Expect from the Stock Market TomorrowThe big news tomorrow — though unlikely to make as big a splash as this tariff pause did today — is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April. Headline month over month CPI is expected to provide the biggest swing: +0.2% versus -0.1% reported a month ago, +0.3% on core versus +0.1% for March. Year over year, headline is expected to remain steady at +2.4%, and steady at +2.8% on core year over year.These figures, should they come in as expected, would still be notably above the optimal levels the Fed targets for inflation. Market strength and an absence of economic troubles that harsh tariff policies set in motion will likely keep any interest rate cuts at bay for now anyway, with the probability of a June rate cut tumbling from 64.4% to 8.1% today. The highest probability for the first cut of 2025 is currently the September meeting. Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Warby Parker is less influential than EssilorLuxottica in the industry, they say.

"The Score: Meta Platforms, McDonald's, Kohl's and More Stocks That Defined the Week — WSJ",1746220380000,"By Francesca FontanaThe Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them.Meta PlatformsSeveral ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants posted earnings — which lived up to the hype?Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results that reassured investors and boosted markets.Meta said growth would remain steady, assuaging concerns that tariffs would hurt the social-media company's digital-ads business. Microsoft indicated that big corporate clients aren't slashing their technology budgets just yet.Meta shares gained 4.2% Thursday, while Microsoft shares jumped 7.6%.The tech optimism faded after Apple and Amazon.com's quarterly reports Thursday.The iPhone maker's sales rose, but it said current tariff plans would add $900 million to costs this quarter. Amazon predicted a solid quarter, but the lower ends of its forecasts missed analysts expectations.On Friday, Amazon shares edged 0.1% lower, and Apple shares fell 3.7%.NvidiaThe U.S.-China chipmaking rivalry is heating up.Huawei Technologies is gearing up to test the Ascend 910D, its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, The Wall Street Journal reported.The Chinese company hopes the latest iteration of its Ascend AI chips will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, a popular chip used for AI training that was released in 2022.Washington has attempted to block Beijing, including cutting off access to some Western chip-making equipment. Huawei, which has emerged as China's champion in the field, has been on a U.S. trade blacklist for nearly six years.Nvidia shares fell 2.1% Monday.United Parcel ServiceUPS is slashing costs and shrinking its workforce.The package giant said it would cut 20,000 operational jobs this year, and it expects to close 73 leased and owned buildings this year.The moves come after UPS in January decided to reduce the amount of packages it delivers for Amazon.com, its biggest customer.Chief Executive Carol Tomé said the cost-cutting was timely, given uncertainty around tariffs.Last year, UPS — which has nearly 490,000 employees — closed 11 buildings and cut 12,000 jobs. About 330,000 of its workers are represented by the Teamsters.After edging 0.4% lower Tuesday, UPS shares declined 1.5% Wednesday.Kohl'sKohl's fired its chief executive for cause over deals he made with his lover, The Wall Street Journal reported.The c-suite shake-up came after the retailer discovered CEO Ashley Buchanan had instructed the company to enter into a ""highly unusual"" business deal involving Chandra Holt, according to people familiar with the situation. The pair currently live together in an upscale golf community in the suburbs of Dallas.Kohl's said Buchanan didn't disclose the relationship as required by its code of ethics. Buchanan will forfeit all equity awards from Kohl's and be required to reimburse the company on a prorated basis a signing bonus worth $2.5 million.Kohl's shares gained 7.6% Thursday.McDonald'sThe ""Golden Arches"" lost some luster as Americans cut back on spending.McDonald's posted a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue, driven in part by fewer guests visiting the fast-food chain's U.S. locations.Low-income consumers particularly reduced their budgets, but so did middle-income households, McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski told investors on a Thursday conference call. Higher-income consumers maintained their visits, illustrating the ""divided U.S. economy,"" he saidAs consumer spending slows, a number of restaurants have reported falling sales, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Domino's Pizza, and Starbucks.McDonald's shares fell 1.9% Thursday.BlockFintech company Block cut its annual guidance, flagging a ""pronounced shift"" in consumer spending.Block — the parent of platforms Cash App and Square — missed quarterly profit forecasts and said users of its Cash App Card had cut back on nonessentials like travel and media. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said the consumer behavior changes drove the majority of the miss.The company is now anticipating 12% growth in gross profit year over year — down from 15% — and expects 9.5% growth in gross profit to $2.45 billion for the second quarter.Dorsey believes Cash App's gross profit growth, and Block overall, will accelerate starting in the third quarter.Block shares plummeted 20% Friday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

Stocks to Watch as the U.S. & China Reach a Trade Deal,1747086840000,"Stocks surged on Monday as the U.S. and China announced a deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs, leading to much optimism that a global economic recession may be avoided.Easing an ongoing trade war, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, with China reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement will last 90 days, as the two sides work on building a sustainable, long-term trade relationship.The S&P 500 rose +3% in today’s trading session, with the Nasdaq spiking over +4%, as investors flock to big tech stocks that had sold off during rising trade tensions.The Mag 7 At the center of what has been a historic market rebound are the mega-cap big tech stocks, with Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Tesla TSLA leading the market gains on Monday and up over +6% respectively. It’s likely that analysts may become more bullish on Apple’s short-term outlook as most of the electronic giant’s production comes from China. A continued run-up in Apple, Amazon, and Meta stock looks fundamentally plausible, but it’s noteworthy that Tesla lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on a trend of declining earnings estimate revisions. Suggesting now may be a good time to fade the rally in Tesla stock is that TSLA has spiked +25% in the last month. Furthermore, Tesla has the highest P/E valuation among the Mag 7 at 161.4X forward earnings, with Alphabet GOOGL being the cheapest at 16.2X.Nvidia NVDA and Microsoft MSFT have started to gain nice momentum as well, although the latter was only up +2% today. Still, Microsoft is the only Mag 7 stock that currently has a buy rating with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the others all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) outside of Tesla’s strong sell rating. This comes as fiscal 2025 EPS estimates for Microsoft are up 2% over the last 60 days, with FY26 EPS estimates up 1%. Alibaba & TencentOptimistically, Chinese tech stocks have already benefited from higher investor sentiment before the tariff truce with the U.S., as Chinese President Xi Jinping has been more supportive of their independent growth. With regulatory issues being less of a concern to investors, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY are two Chinese tech stocks to pay attention to and currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Their ADR’s (American Depository Receipts) have been two of the top performers on U.S. stock exchanges this year, with BABA soaring nearly +60% year to date and TCEHY up over +20%. The strong price performance has been due to their artificial intelligence expansion, leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience, as Alibaba has seen higher e-commerce sales, and Tencent has benefited from growth in its gaming and cloud services. Retail Stocks Outside of Amazon and Apple, retailers like Nike NKE, Starbucks SBUX, and even Walmart WMT and Target TGT rely heavily on supply chain operations from China. Nike and Starbucks also generate a significant portion of their revenue from their operations within China, which would make better trade and political relations between the U.S. and China beneficial to their outlook.Nike and Walmart stock stand out with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Starbucks and Target have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Plus, China accounted for 14% of Nike’s revenue in 2024, with $5.5 billion coming from footwear sales alone, as shown in the chart below.Image Source: StatistaEnergy & Transportation Stocks Energy and transportation stocks will also be important to watch, as they could receive a continued boost in the following weeks thanks to today’s trade agreement. While geopolitical tensions can often cause an uptick in crude oil prices, the trade war between the U.S. and China had an adverse effect in regard to how the market saw future demand for travel and other activities that require higher energy production. Crude prices were up as much as +2% to over $62 a barrel but are still down 20% in 2025.Image Source: Trading Economics Bottom Line The U.S. and China trade agreement gave the market what it was looking for, as investors now have more reassurance that the global economy will be less impacted by higher tariffs. That said, keeping an eye on the progress that is hopefully made in the next 90 days will be critical, considering the U.S. and China are the world's two largest economies.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7a4eb6869094b:0-stocks-to-watch-as-the-u-s-china-reach-a-trade-deal/
EssilorLuxottica Should Benefit From Google's Push Into Smart Eyewear — Market Talk,1747823400000,"EssilorLuxottica should benefit from Google's partnership with both Warby Parker and Kering to develop artificial intelligence-powered glasses, Equita Sim analyst Domenico Ghilotti writes in a note. The deal signals the expected reaction of players like Google to the commercial success of Ray-Ban smart glasses, which EssilorLuxottica develops with Meta Platforms, Ghilotti says. It marks ""a confirmation of the growing relevance of this product for the penetration of AI solutions,"" the analyst adds. EssilorLuxottica and the Facebook parent company are leading the category to date, with 2 million of Ray-Ban smart glasses sold at the end of 2024 and a new release expected for the second half of the current year, he says.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.43 billion people daily. Meta Platforms’ growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>> )Shares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past year (+34.9% vs. +23.5%). The company’s first-quarter 2025 results reflected solid capital markets performance and loan demand. Business expansion efforts, decent loan demand and higher rates support net interest income (NII). We expect NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3% by 2027. While a solid resurgence in deal-making activities is likely to take time, a solid pipeline will drive the Investment Banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to witness a CAGR of 2.1% by 2027. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. The Zacks analyst estimate for the metric shows a 6.2% fall in 2025. As it invests in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain high. Our estimates for non-interest expenses imply a CAGR of 2.9% by 2027. Weak asset quality is a concern.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>> )Intercontinental Exchange’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry over the year-to-date period (+16.3% vs. +13.6%). The company’s top line benefits from its compelling product and service portfolio, the broad range of risk management services and strength in global data services. Continued strength in its energy franchise and improving recurring market data revenues are likely to keep growth on track. Strategic buyouts help it achieve cost synergies that are in sync with its aim of generating long-term value for shareholders. It is well-poised for growth due to accelerated digitization in the U.S. residential mortgage industry. Intercontinental Exchange also engages in the effective deployment of capital. However, expenses are likely to remain high in the near term. Foreign currency fluctuations and stricter regulations raise concerns.

Wall Street Logs Best Day in More Than Four Weeks After US-China Tariff Pact,1747083713000,"Wall Street's benchmark indexes posted their biggest one-day gains in more than four weeks on Monday after the US and China agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. The Nasdaq Composite closed 4.4% higher at 18,708.3, the S&P 500 climbed 3.3% to 5,844.2, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.8% to 42,410.1. All three notched their biggest daily percentage gains since April 9. Barring utilities, all sectors ended in the green, led by consumer discretionary with a 5.7% gain. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties following their talks in Switzerland over the weekend. The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday he expects to meet with Chinese officials again ""in the next few weeks"" to continue trade negotiations, CNBC reported. The tariff cuts likely take a recession ""off the table for now,"" Wedbush Securities said in a Monday client note. Oxford Economics said that ""though the pause is temporary and risks to the outlook because of tariffs remain weighted to the downside, the agreement implies less of a drag on the economy through the rest of this year from three of the four shocks hitting it.""The so-called magnificent-7 group of stocks rallied, with Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN soaring 8.1%, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META advancing 7.9%, and Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA rising 6.8%.

BlackRock expects continued high volatility due to slower growth and evolving trade dynamics.A resilient labor market and potential tariff-driven inflation could limit the Fed's capacity to cut rates. In this environment, low-volatility strategies and defensive stocks may help reduce portfolio risk.The iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol U.S.A. ETF USMV—the most popular fund in the space—selects and weights stocks to create a portfolio with lower volatility relative to the broader market. The strategy uses optimization, accounting for both the correlation between stocks and their individual volatility.AI beneficiaries struggled earlier this year, particularly following DeepSeek’s AI reveal and growing concerns over trade wars. However, recent big tech earnings suggest the AI trade is far from slowing down.Google GOOG and Microsoft MSFT reaffirmed their spending plans, while Meta META raised its full-year capital expenditure guidance. This is good news for NVIDIA NVDA, which remains the biggest beneficiary of the massive AI buildout.Software ETFs like the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV are also worth considering, as these companies stand to benefit from declining AI costs and increasing adoption.Amid uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, BlackRock favors the shorter end of the yield curve. Furthermore, as bonds no longer offer the same diversification benefits, they did in previous decades, investors should consider gold and other alternative assets.Tune in to the podcast to learn more!Make sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of ETF Spotlight!

The market benchmark ended Friday's session at 5,686.67. The S&P slipped 0.8% in April, marking its third-consecutive monthly decline. The index is down 3.3% for the year on worries about the impacts of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly the ongoing trade war with several countries including China.

Temu and Shein Will Feel 'De Minimis' Pain. So Will These U.S. Companies. — Barrons.com,1746212520000,"By Sabrina EscobarThe Trump administration finally closed the so-called de minimis loophole for Chinese imports, taking a shot at the business models of Chinese-founded retailers such as Shein and Temu.But several American firms may get caught in the crossfire.The de minimis trade ushered in a whole new economy that revolved around shipping products directly from Chinese factories to consumers, creating new freight and advertising demands that benefited a host of companies, from Big Tech to FedEx.Now the loophole has officially closed, these firms are sounding the alarm, while the likes of Shein and Temu — which is owned by PDD Holdings — are navigating a blow to their business.The De Minimis TradeDe minimis is a customs law that allows imported goods valued below $800 to enter the country without incurring duties or formal customs procedures. Companies such as Shein and Temu capitalized on the policy to ship items from abroad directly to consumers in packages that fell under the threshold, helping them sidestep tariffs and keep prices low.There were over 1.36 billion shipments coming in under the de minimis exemption in fiscal 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection. Many of those were from retailers selling direct to consumers — and the practice isn't limited to Shein and Temu. Many others have since emulated the model, including Amazon.com.Starting Friday, however, goods mailed from China or Hong Kong that previously fell under de minimis are subject to a 120% tariff, or a fee ranging from $100 to $200 per item.Analysts say the change will likely result in higher prices for Shein and Temu products in the long run as the companies recalibrate their business models. But for now, the companies seem to be searching for ways to keep prices low.Social media posts over the past few days suggested Temu had increased shipping fees to account for the tariffs. The company put up a notice that it would be adjusting prices in late April. On Friday, however, Temu told Barron's by email that its pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model and recruits U.S. sellers onto the platform.All U.S. orders are now handled by local sellers and fulfilled within the country, meaning they aren't subject to import charges, the company added. Items on Temu's website Friday now have a tag denoting their shipping origination as ""local.""Shein didn't immediately respond to Barron's request for comment, but the company has been advocating for de minimis reform and has also been trying to source products from countries other than China for several years now.Bloomberg reported earlier this week the company had hiked prices across several categories. A notice on Shein's website Friday read: ""Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You'll never have to pay extra at delivery.""The companies likely imported products to U.S. warehouses earlier this year to get ahead of the policy changes, which could give them a buffer from having to aggressively raise prices, but that could change when inventory runs out.The Other CasualtiesAlthough companies such as Shein and Temu were the main targets of the de minimis policy change, some U.S. firms are getting swept up in the drama, too.For instance, tech companies such as Amazon and Etsy will be directly affected by the changes.Amazon opened its Shein rival, Haul, last fall. Haul shipments relied on de minimis to send products to U.S. consumers straight from Amazon's Chinese warehouse. Haul considered listing tariff charges on certain products, but an Amazon spokesperson said the idea was never approved. It was definitively scrapped after the White House lambasted the move as a ""hostile and political act.""Meanwhile, Etsy said on Wednesday the majority of its gross merchandise sales comes into the U.S. under the de minimis exemption, but just 1% of products are Americans buying directly from Chinese vendors, meaning the current change ""would not have any material impact"" on its finances. A bigger challenge would be if the exemption gets removed altogether, executives said, as it could result in higher import costs and shipment backlogs.Others in Big Tech may find themselves hurting from a loss of advertising dollars from companies like Shein and Temu, which have been big spenders in recent years.The de minimis change was the only reference that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made to the recent updates to trade policy on the company's latest earnings call, foregoing any other mentions of tariffs.""We're obviously not immune to the macro environment,"" he said. ""But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers.""Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company had seen reduced spend in advertising from Asia-based e-commerce companies in anticipation of the de minimis reform. Snap's Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said the company had ""heard from a subset of advertisers that their spending has been impacted by the changes to the de minimis exemption.""The airfreight market could also come under pressure as tariffs get collected, because a good chunk of growth was driven by de minimis shipments, wrote Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory group, in an April 21 note.FedEx, UPS, and DHL, three of the largest airfreight companies, haven't disclosed how much of their business is tied to de minimis, but all have hinted the changes could lead to lower shipment volumes.UPS said in its April 29 earnings call that trade policy changes had factored into its decision to refrain from providing updates on its full-year guidance, and why its second-quarter outlook was muted (the company expects average daily volume to drop 9% year over year).DHL said that while it has been working to reduce its exposure to the de minimis trade, it will likely lead to a reduction in volume that will have an impact on results.But, executives added, they aren't expecting a complete wipe out of de minimis volumes because they will likely find other channels to bring items into the U.S., such as bulk shipping.Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

US-China Tariff Suspension Pact Sends Equities Soaring Intraday,1747074142000,"US benchmark equity indexes and Treasury yields surged intraday after the US and China agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.1% at 18,655.4 after midday Monday, while the S&P 500 jumped 3% to 5,828.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.5% to 42,297.9. Among sectors, consumer discretionary paced the gainers, up 5.4%, while utilities and consumer staples were in the red. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties following their talks in Switzerland over the weekend. The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday he expects to meet with Chinese officials again ""in the next few weeks"" to continue trade negotiations, CNBC reported. The tariff cuts likely take a recession ""off the table for now,"" Wedbush Securities said in a Monday client note. Oxford Economics said that ""though the pause is temporary and risks to the outlook because of tariffs remain weighted to the downside, the agreement implies less of a drag on the economy through the rest of this year from three of the four shocks hitting it.""The so-called magnificent-7 group of stocks, which comprises Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META and Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN all rose. Amazon shares were up 7.9%, the top gainer on the Dow, with Apple among the best index performers. US Treasury yields were up intraday, with the two-year rate soaring 11.7 basis points to 4% and the 10-year rate adding eight basis points to 4.46%. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 1.9% at $62.18 a barrel. Oil prices jumped on ""hopes of demand boost from easing tensions between the world's two largest economies,"" D.A. Davidson said.

Walmart NYSE:WMT , Cisco Systems NASDAQ:CSCO and Applied Materials NASDAQ:AMAT are among the major companies scheduled to report results later this week. NRG Energy NYSE:NRG shares surged 24%, the top gainer on the S&P 500, after the company agreed to acquire a portfolio of power assets from LS Power Equity Advisors in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $12 billion. Newmont NYSE:NEM shares were down 6.3%, the worst S&P 500 performer. The company late Friday said it reduced its stake in Discovery Silver. Gold was down 3.4% at $3,230.80 per troy ounce, while silver dropped 1% to $32.59 per ounce.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250512:A3376601:0/
"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

At the mid-point, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and a sequential decline of approximately 7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.12 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 30.11%. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 93 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The earnings estimate indicates growth of 50% on a year-over-year basis.AMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.32%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar).Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Stock Price and EPS SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.AMD’s Data Center & Client Segment Revenues to Grow Y/YAMD’s first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from growth in both its data center and client segments, driven by continued demand for its EPYC processors and Ryzen chips. The data center segment, in particular, has been a major contributor to AMD’s success, and the company expects this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. AMD expects the Data Center segment’s revenues to significantly increase, driven by the strong sales of its data center chips that support hyperscalers and power AI and Generative AI applications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Data Center revenues is pegged at $3.4 billion, indicating an impressive year-over-year surge of 47.5%.The company is likely to see continued growth in its client business, driven by higher demand for Ryzen processors across desktop and mobile platforms. AMD’s collaborations, such as the one with Dell Technologies DELL for Ryzen Pro processors in commercial PCs, are expected to have bolstered growth in this segment in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Client segment revenues is pegged at $2.04 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 49.3%.Weak Embedded & Gaming to Hurt AMD’s Q1 ResultsAMD’s near-term prospects suffer from weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments. On a year-over-year basis, these segments' revenues are expected to have declined.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Embedded revenues is pegged at $570 million, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming revenues is pegged at $509 million, suggesting a massive 38.1% decline.AMD Stock Underperforms Sector & IndustryAdvanced Micro Devices shares have lost 17.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 9% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s decline of 7.2%.YTD AMD Stock PerformanceThe AMD stock is not so cheap, as its Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales, Advanced Micro Devices is currently trading at 4.68X, higher than the Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s 2.90X.Price/Sales Ratio (Forward 12 Months)AMD Benefits From Rich Partner BaseAMD benefits from a rich partner base, which includes Microsoft MSFT, Oracle, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo, Meta Platforms META and IBM having Instinct platforms in production.The demand for AI accelerators like the Instinct MI300 series, especially from hyperscalers, is expected to continue growing, further boosting data center revenues in the first quarter of 2025. In the Data Center AI business, MI300X deployment increased with cloud partners, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, IBM, Digital Ocean and Dell Technologies, among others.Meta Platforms used MI300X to power its Llama 405B frontier model on meta.ai. It added instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads.Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services. IBM announced plans to enable MI300X on its Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications.Dell Technologies started offering MI300X as part of its AI factory solution suite.

Amazon and Tech Stocks Rally. Stay Cautious. — Barrons.com,1747067160000,"By Angela Palumbo and Adam ClarkAmazon.com was leading the Magnificent Seven group of stocks on Monday as markets welcomed a truce on tariffs between the U.S. and China. Tech investors should keep in mind that there's still a long road ahead.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said early Monday that the U.S. and China have agreed to lower reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. Amazon shares were up 7.4% on the news. That outstripped gains for fellow Mag 7 members Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, which gives equal weight to the group of stocks, was up 4.9%.""With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Monday.It isn't hard to see why Amazon could be a beneficiary of a trade deal between the world's two largest economies. Many of the sellers on its e-commerce marketplace source their goods from China, and the reduction in tariffs will mean they can continue to do business.Amazon investors may also be breathing a sigh of relief over the possibility that spending on advertising may continue to be strong. About 30% of Amazon's first-party merchandise is sourced from China, and Chinese advertisers spent around $8 billion on Amazon advertising in 2024, according to Raymond James estimates.In recent weeks, Wall Street has been concerned that Asia-based advertisers were starting to show signs of weakness. The Trump administration removed a commonly used trade loophole called the de minimis exemption that allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs. Chinese companies, known for lower-priced items, may not want to put as much money into advertising if prices increase and consumers stop spending.If tariffs remain lower than threatened, those price increases may not emerge, and spending might not wane.In that scenario, other tech companies would also benefit. Meta and Alphabet both make a lot of money from advertising, and each of those tech giants said on their most recent earnings calls that they were starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back on advertising. Snapchat parent Snap Inc., which makes almost all of its money from ads, withheld financial guidance in April due to economic uncertainty. That stock was up 7.3% on Monday.Before investors get too excited, it is important to remember that the news is all very fresh. It will take some time for advertisers to go back to their pre-tariff strength, and with a temporary trade deal, there is still uncertainty as to what could come next.The semiconductor industry was also performing well on Monday. Nvidia was up 3.7%, On Semiconductor was surging 9.6%, and Texas Instruments was climbing 8.4%. Wall Street was optimistic that the negotiations could lead to an outcome where electronic goods produced in China that use chips weren't taxed by the U.S. as heavily, and supply chains weren't as disrupted.However, there is more to the chip sector that investors should watch. First, the U.S. has imposed export controls on chips as it seeks to become the winner of the AI race. The Trump administration exempted semiconductors and other electronic products from the reciprocal tariffs, opting instead to target chips specifically through sector tariffs in the future.Secretary Bessent signaled those sector tariffs will still come, saying on CNBC on Monday that reciprocal tariffs have nothing to do with industry-specific tariffs for ""strategic necessities"" like semiconductors, steel, and some medicines.While the market rebounds and tech stocks soar, it's important to remember that there is much more that's likely to come in the months ahead.""This is a textbook recovery after the market's waterfall declines. Expect volatility as we approach the 90-day reciprocal tariffs deadline, "" Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote on Monday. She added that Monday's rally ""illustrates why we tell our clients not to trade headlines.""Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com and Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The AI Diffusion Rule is Over. What That Means for Trump and China. — Barrons.com,1747747020000,"By Justin ShermanAbout the author: Justin Sherman is the founder and CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, a research and advisory firm, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.In a major trade and security pivot, President Donald Trump has scrapped his predecessor's so-called artificial intelligence diffusion rule that was set to be implemented last week. That rule, signed by President Joe Biden in his final days in office, added export controls on integrated circuits and AI models to countries such as China and Iran — with big exemptions for friendly nations such as Germany. Some U.S. AI and chip companies are cheering on this reversal, their present view reflecting that of a Commerce Department spokesperson: Biden's AI rule was ""overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation.""At face value, it seems the leading industry players and the U.S. government are on the same page: Companies want to build and sell chips and AI products globally, and the administration wants U.S. industry to boom. Both worry about Beijing's AI capabilities and threats to U.S. national security. Same talk, same page.But many chip and AI companies' talk about national security and China is more or less just that — talk. For some firms, talking about China and national security is simply a way to frame their own priorities, such as relaxing export controls or building data centers, in terms that land well with the current top policymakers. It seems like talking about Biden's diffusion rule as overly burdensome for companies — and therefore bad for national security — worked.When the rubber meets the road, however, AI and chip companies may not like the Trump administration's hawkish position on China, and the administration may not like companies' true views on national security issues. Whatever replaces the AI diffusion rule will expose those critical tensions.These commercial AI and national security concerns have been brewing under the surface for months. In 2024, many AI companies were trying to present themselves as moving in lockstep with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China. But the Biden administration's domestic work on trustworthy AI certainly caused friction with industry — particularly for those who would rather do away with safeguards. And some began whittling away at the national security narrative.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in July 2024 that closing off U.S. AI systems to China would be a mistake, as America's advantage comes from openness and fewer controls. Framed in the context of helping national security, the anti-regulatory argument spoke to a bigger policy concern: China. OpenAI, shortly thereafter, pitched the administration on a massive data center buildout, likewise framed as key to geopolitical competition. This kind of rhetoric, speaking to fears of ""falling behind"" in what many reductively call the ""AI race,"" also found a receptive audience in Washington. Biden started to put his executive order on data centers in motion.The apparent alignment between the government and commercial chip and AI firms changed with the flick of a pen. When the Biden team published the AI diffusion rule on Jan. 13, the backlash was swift from companies that were, a moment ago, speaking as if they backed the president's national security rationale.Nvidia released a statement that day calling the rule a misguided, unprecedented effort that ""threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide"" and ""squander America's hard-won technological advantage."" The rule is ""cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, "" but ""would do nothing to enhance U.S. security.""That rhetoric evidently worked on the new administration — and the benefits shortly flowed to investors. The day after Trump nixed the diffusion rule, Nvidia's stock rose 4.4%. AMD's stock rose 3.4%. But ditching Biden's order is a temporary resolve between these commercial and national security tensions, likely to be disrupted when the Trump administration rolls out the rule's replacement.A replacement program could relax chip and AI model technology exports to some countries favored by Trump, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and hugely ramp up limits for China. That will prompt industry concerns for chip companies wanting to sell in China and to maintain certain China-based supply chain points. Or a new program could soften restrictions below a certain compute or model performance threshold, but broadly curb exports of higher-end technologies in ways that impact a different vertical of industry sales.As a general rule, export restrictions focused on national security are going to both limit companies' overseas market opportunities and speak to issues that aren't companies' bread and butter. Just as some investment firms are skeptical of inbound and outbound investment screening, some leading chip and AI companies are unlikely to truly buy into the scope and degree of national security concerns about exports to China.So administration officials — particularly those most hawkish on Beijing — may find themselves in direct confrontation with chip and AI companies that are keen on continuing to sell high-end chips to Chinese buyers. The administration's concerns about AI diffusion to China through third countries may also conflict with companies that feel even countries with close ties to China aren't in fact China — and therefore aren't a risk. Officials could even encounter the same amount of pushback and criticism on a more relaxed export rule than the Biden administration faced on its more sweeping one. After all, the psychological treadmill kicks in, and even a more moderate set of rules will still raise the regulatory floor — and demand higher compliance costs and impact bottom lines.This isn't to say every chip and AI company is crying ""national security"" just to get on policymakers' calendars. Plenty of chip and AI companies build tech entirely or primarily for national security use cases. Some major AI vendors, such as Anthropic, supported the AI diffusion rule with tweaks. Last month, Anthropic said stronger export controls on chips were necessary to keep a competitive lead over China.It is healthy for commercial enterprises to have a range of views on geopolitical and national security issues, especially in a volatile global trade and geopolitical environment.But as the administration talks genuinely about the country's AI advantage over China, these tensions under the surface will bubble up again. Companies will have to navigate more uncertainty and new national security guidelines. And policymakers may have to confront public-private differences of opinion on China head-on.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Should You Hold NVIDIA Stock as Meta & Microsoft Double Down on AI?,1746212400000,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA stock gained nearly 2.5% on Thursday, buoyed by a renewed wave of optimism from two of its largest customers, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. Both tech giants reaffirmed, and in Meta Platforms’ case, raised their capital expenditure commitments toward AI infrastructure.This resurgence of AI-related investment could mark a key turning point for NVIDIA stock, which has pulled back 27% from its 52-week high of $153.13 attained on Jan. 7, 2025. With the renewed optimism about AI investment, the question arises: Should investors rush to buy more, or is holding the stock the smarter move right now?AI Spending Spree Could Reignite Demand for NVIDIA’s ChipsMicrosoft, a major cloud provider and longtime NVIDIA partner, confirmed during its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call that it will maintain its massive $80 billion capital expenditure plan for AI data centers, with more than half of that directed toward U.S. operations.Meanwhile, during its first-quarter 2025 earnings call, Meta Platforms increased its 2025 capital spending outlook to a range of $64-$72 billion, up from the prior $60-$65 billion range. The added spending will primarily go toward expanding data center capacity and AI infrastructure, both heavily reliant on NVIDIA’s high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).Meta Platforms’ CFO, Susan Li, made it clear that the CapEx bump is driven by AI ambitions and infrastructure upgrades. Similarly, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood indicated that fiscal 2026 investments will grow, albeit at a slower pace, and be more closely aligned with short-term revenue gains, implying accelerated AI workload deployments.These commitments are strong signals that NVIDIA’s chips, especially its H100 and upcoming B100 GPUs, will remain in high demand as hyperscalers scale their AI platforms.AI Boom Driving NVIDIA’s Financial PerformanceNVIDIA’s products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues from the data center end-market grew 93% year over year to $35.58 billion and contributed 90.5% to the total sales.AI-driven workloads, cloud computing expansion and increasing enterprise adoption of AI models have turned NVIDIA’s high-performance chips into a necessity rather than a luxury. With businesses aggressively investing in AI infrastructure, NVIDIA remains positioned at the heart of this technological transformation.Financially, NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues surged 78% year over year, while non-GAAP EPS climbed 71%. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance of $43 billion in revenues represents a staggering increase from $26.04 billion in the prior-year quarter.Analysts expect NVIDIA to maintain this momentum, forecasting fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenue growth of 48% and 24%, respectively. With earnings projected to rise 42% in fiscal 2026 and 27% in fiscal 2027, NVIDIA’s long-term investment case remains intact. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.9%.NVIDIA Corporation Stock Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNVIDIA Overvaluation Warrants a CautionValuation-wise, NVIDIA is overvalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of D.However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, NVDA shares are trading at 13.32X, higher than the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s 10.96X.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowNVIDIA’s stock may be off its highs, but the AI megatrend is very much alive and is receiving fresh fuel from the likes of Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Their deep-pocketed commitments to AI infrastructure spending underscore NVIDIA’s strategic importance in the evolving tech landscape. However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility. For now, holding the stock is the smartest approach.Currently, NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Bull of the Day: TaskUs (TASK),1747728000000,"Providing outsourced digital services, TaskUs TASK is an up-and-coming tech company that investors should consider right now.Most appealing, TaskUs stock is trading under $20 a share, and the company’s diversification makes it a very appealing investment as it relates to the rapid expansion of the outsourced digital services market.TaskUs serves the crypto, social media, e-commerce, gaming, food delivery, and ride sharing industries, among others, with some of its most notable clients being Coinbase COIN, Meta Platforms META, DoorDash DASH, and Uber UBER.Outsourced Digital Services OverviewAs a brief overview, outsourced digital services refer to the practice of hiring external experts or companies to manage and implement digital products or services most commonly including IT support and cloud computing, software development, digital marketing, customer service, and data analytics. As for TaskUs, its digital outsourcing specialties include AI-powered customer support and content moderation. Furthermore, in the grand scheme of things, the global IT services outsourcing market was valued at over $700 billion in 2024 and is expected to be worth upwards of $1 trillion by 2030, with a projected CAGR of more than 8% during this period. This comes as the COVID-19 pandemic showed the prolific need for digital content in particular, leading to increased demand for outsourcing these specific services. Image Source: Grand View ResearchTaskUs Accelerates Agentic AI Services Going back to its diversity and expansion, TaskUs recently announced a strategic partnership with AI-driven customer support companies Decagon and Regal last Tuesday. The partnerships augment TaskUs' agentic AI consulting practice, a set of business services and expertise that help companies seamlessly integrate advanced AI technologies into their customer experience operations.To that point, agentic AI can accomplish complex tasks autonomously with minimal human interaction, unlike traditional AI models, as it builds on the rapid progress of generative AI by exhibiting goal-driven behavior, adaptability, and reasoning to solve problems dynamically.TaskUs Growth Trajectory Based on Zacks' estimates, TaskUs’ total sales are expected to rise 13% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to increase another 12% in FY26 to $1.26 billion. Plus, annual earnings are expected to be up 7% this year and are projected to spike another 14% in FY26 to $1.57 per share.It’s also noteworthy that FY26 sales projections would represent 163% growth from sales of $478 million during the height of the pandemic in 2020, with TaskUs going public in June of 2021.TaskUs’ Attractive Valuation While many tech stocks with attractive growth potential (especially as it relates to AI) can usually trade at a stretched premium to the broader market, TASK shares are trading at a very reasonable 12X forward earnings multiple. In comparison, TaskUs’ Zacks Computers-IT Services Industry average is at 21.6X forward earnings, with the benchmark S&P 500’s average currently at 22.9X. Notably, TaskUs also trades at less than 2X sales, which can be a rarity for expansive tech companies even in their later stages of corporate life. Bottom Line Considering its concentration on agentic AI, now appears to be an ideal time to buy TaskUs stock with TASK having an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum. More intriguing, TASK has rebounded and soared over +40% in the last two years but still offers a nearly 30% discount from its IPO price of $23.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:624c6f8da094b:0-bull-of-the-day-taskus-task/
Stocks Rise Pre-Bell on US-China Trade Agreement; Investors Await Key Inflation Data,1747049962000,"The benchmark US stock measures were pointing higher before the opening bell on Monday as Washington and Beijing struck a deal to slash tariffs on each other's goods, while investors await key inflation data later in the week.

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

These companies are emerging as potential winners in Trump's trade war,1746205320000,"By James RogersThis earnings season, companies in some sectors have started spelling out the potential financial impact of tariffs, while others have withdrawn their outlooks citing too much uncertaintyThe fallout from President Trump's sweeping tariffs agenda is casting a long shadow over earnings season as companies wrestle with the unfolding trade war, but there are also glimmers of opportunity amid the uncertainty, according to LPL Financial.Despite the market turmoil, names in some sectors are spelling out the financial impact of tariffs, while others have pulled their guidance, saying that the economic outlook is too uncertain. A handful of names have even cited potential benefits from the tariffs climate.Set against this backdrop, Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted opportunities in a note released this week. He categorizes this current period as ""phase one,"" characterized as ""peak uncertainty and peak tariffs,"" with ""phase two"" the period ""after the tariff dust settles.""""We believe consumer staples, real estate, and gold are well positioned for the current phase of uncertainty,"" wrote Buchbinder.He acknowledged, however, that not all consumer staples companies will be immune.Domestic packaged food companies are relatively insulated thanks to specialty crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados and chocolate falling within the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, he said. ""On the other hand, dollar stores and supercenters are not immune due to a reliance on goods from China and will be forced to raise prices or adjust supply chains after inventories are depleted,"" Buchbinder added.Related: GE Healthcare sees tariffs costing $500 million in 2025, then much less next yearBuchbinder said empty shelves are a real risk, and that imports of alcoholic beverages and spirits could be a point of pain. He also mentions the impact of cumulative price increases, ongoing sticky inflation and elevated consumer borrowing.""That said, given staples are more 'needs' than 'wants' and revenues typically hold up well in an economic slowdown, we'll put consumer staples in the phase-one winner category,"" he added.However, Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the parent of household brands including Pampers, Gillette, Crest and Tide, cut its earnings outlook last week amid worries about higher prices from tariffs and a slowing economy. Toothpaste and soap maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) also cut its guidance last week.Parts of the healthcare sector also stand to benefit from the current tariffs climate, according to LPL Financial.""It would be logical to put the defensive healthcare sector among the phase one winners, but pharmaceuticals are in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's trade policy,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""Sectoral tariffs could rattle the sector, pending successful country-level negotiations.""However, the analyst sees opportunity around medical devices. ""On the medical equipment side, tariff exposure is relatively limited, with the most exposed companies generating 12% or less of their revenue in China and most manufacturing housed in the U.S., so that group may be a phase one winner,"" he wrote.The healthcare sector has been breaking down the financial cost of tariffs in recent weeks.Medical technology company GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (GEHC) said earlier this week that the impact of the global tariffs war will cost it around $500 million at current rates and cut its full-year profit outlook. And medical-device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT) estimated recently that tariffs will cost it ""a few hundred million dollars"" this year, but reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Related: Procter & Gamble sees consumers hit 'pause' amid tariffs, job-market uncertaintyLast week, drugmaker Merck & Co. (MRK) said that its reaffirmed 2025 outlook absorbs an estimated $200 million in additional costs for already implemented tariffs. Medical-technology and drug company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) estimated that tariffs could result in about $400 million in extra costs and raised its sales outlook.Financials are also a phase-one winner because of the sector's limited exposure to goods imports, according to LPL Financial, although cyclicality also makes them a potential winner in phase two.For phase two, LPL Financial sees the communication services sector as a potential winner, with ""honorable mentions"" for technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials.In communication services, LPL Financial points to solid first-quarter results from Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX).""The key risk, beyond regulatory pressures on the big internet companies, is that tariff rates don't come down as much as we anticipate, weighing on margins in this space, although the effects on the digital media segment of the sector are quite manageable,"" Buchbinder wrote.He believes the tech sector could easily grow earnings 20% this year as AI investment continues but says that technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. ""The sector has underperformed since July of 2024,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""We also worry about semiconductor industry disruptions from U.S.-China trade tensions,"" he added, noting that this has challenged Nvidia Corp.'s performance lately.Software appears better positioned for this environment than semiconductors, according to LPL Financial. The financial services company also notes that tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) has significant operations in China that will not be cheap or quick to move away from.Related: Here's how GM is dealing with tariff uncertainty: pulling guidance, halting stock buybackMeanwhile, consumer discretionary, which sell what people ""want,"" is heavily impacted by the tariffs regime.""Tariffs on apparel makers, autos, and home construction materials (primarily lumber) are particularly biting, while policy uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence and contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending,"" wrote Buchbinder.On Thursday car giant General Motors Co. (GM) slashed its profit guidance and said that it expects tariffs to cost up to $5 billion.Elsewhere in consumer discretionary, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) kept its full-year profit outlook intact and described tariffs as ""manageable,"" while rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) cut its full-year outlook.Household products maker Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) said that tariffs could actually benefit its business and maintained much of its 2025 outlook. Consumer-facing washer and dryer maker Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) also said that it could be a ""winner"" under the new tariffs regime and kept its full-year guidance unchanged.However, airlines are a different story, with American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) pulling their guidance amid macroeconomic uncertainty.LPL Financial acknowledges that, while consumer discretionary is one of the sectors hardest hit by tariffs, it makes sense that it would benefit if levies come down.""But the uncertainty is still too high right now and a neutral stance seems prudent,"" Buchbinder wrote.-James RogersThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AI Agents Will Transform Customer Relationships, for Better or Worse — WSJ",1746878400000,"By Steven RosenbushAI agents are poised to make communication between businesses and their customers deeper, more open and more personal. That level of intimacy might be great, but as in any relationship, it creates the potential for hazard, too.The latest generation of AI agents are capable of taking action on behalf of people in a range of functions, including coding , customer service, legal services and booking an appointment with a healthcare provider. Their migration into popular messaging services such as WhatsApp opens up even more opportunities for businesses in the areas of sales, support, marketing and branding.There is a flywheel effect at work here. The AI agent has access to an enormous amount of data about users that makes it possible to tailor recommendations, information, and insights to their needs. And once they reside in a messaging app, they can create a continuing presence in the user's life, just like a person would.""Once an AI knows you and remembers your history, it stops feeling like a tool and starts to feel like a companion,"" says Conor Grennan, chief AI architect at New York University Stern School of Business. ""It starts to blur the line between an AI brand ambassador and just a friend who shares your taste.""But that is also where the potential peril lies. As AI agents become more like people, they are increasingly prone to the pitfalls of human relationships. Last year, for example, Air Canada was ordered to refund a customer after the airline's chatbot gave the wrong details about its bereavement policy. Air Canada said the technology was less sophisticated than more current AI. But it would be rash to assume that today's AI is beyond error.Consumers themselves might not trust an AI agent's answers, and could demand to speak to a human representative the way they do now when they reach automated customer-service phone lines.WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms is betting that combining AI agents and business messaging can provide a new pillar of growth.It has a lot riding on that bet. Meta, which paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014, last month raised its projected companywide capital spending for the year to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, largely on its artificial-intelligence investments.But AI chatbots could help get more businesses using the company's messaging products. It has a number of ways to cash in if they do, including the sale of ads on Instagram or Facebook that let users click to send messages over the regular WhatsApp app that they use everyday.WhatsApp created a specialized app for small businesses and an application programming interface, or API, for large businesses back in 2018, and their usage has been soaring in markets such as India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil, according to Meta's Nikila Srinivasan, vice president of product management for business messaging.Verizon began a WhatsApp campaign for Spanish-speaking customers in the U.S. last fall, according to Robyn Parks, the telecom giant's vice president of segment and local marketing. The campaign uses ads on Facebook or Instagram that give customers or potential customers the option to click to chat on WhatsApp, with an opportunity to move the communication to another channel.The company would typically expect a ""conversation start rate"" for an ad to be in the single digits. The WhatsApp campaign has been in the double digits, she said. Verizon said it also has ads on WhatsApp that direct customers to the Verizon website and app.And if a customer drops out of the conversation, Verizon can use the WhatsApp channel to try to re-engage via WhatsApp text, a process that she described as a ""warm callback."" That wouldn't be possible with advertising in a broadcast medium.""It's much more of a conversation,"" Parks said.Now imagine untold AI agents initiating those warm callbacks. It could be revolutionary — and risky for companies that don't learn to manage those agents with the same care that they manage people.Write to Steven Rosenbush at steven.rosenbush@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250510000577:0/

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The Giants of Silicon Valley Are Having a Midlife Crisis Over AI — WSJ,1746869400000,"By Tim HigginsMiddle age hits hard — even for the Kings of Silicon Valley.One minute you're upending established industries as the young disrupter. The next, you're staring into the abyss, eating glass — as Elon Musk likes to say — watching the disruption at your door.Most, if not all, of the Magnificent Seven are in that position — weirdly trying at the same time to figure out the threat of artificial intelligence to their kingdoms.That dynamic has been on display the past few weeks: Alphabet's stock dropped more than 7% Wednesday after a senior Apple executive disclosed that Google search-traffic on its devices using Safari fell for the first time in 20 years. (Google later clarified it continues to see overall search growth, even from Apple devices.)For his part, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook is trying to buy time for his company, pushing investors during his latest earnings call to be patient with the iPhone maker's delays around AI features.Then there is Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to paint a bright future for his ad-dollar juggernaut as something of an AI-buddy for the lonely.Even Musk seems to be sweating things as he returns from his DOGE sojourn to Tesla, seeking to counter a slide in the electric carmaker's stock price with promises of deploying driverless cars. ""We're not on edge of death — not even close,"" Musk told analysts recently.His protests sounded like that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" character about to be thrown on a pile of corpses: ""I'm not dead! ... I feel happy!""To be fair, none of these giants are dead — yet. And they have lots of reasons to feel happy — they are wildly profitable pillars of corporate America and together represent around $7 trillion of market value.Yet the crossroads they all stand at, collectively, and how they react, individually, look like ready-made case studies for a 21st century update of the classic business school book ""The Innovator's Dilemma.""Author Clayton Christensen tried to explain how new products or services displace existing players by creating new markets. It was a book that made the term ""disruption"" wildly popular in boardrooms — even if used in a way the late Christensen didn't always intend.The gist of his theory was that successful companies doing everything seemingly right can fail when smaller companies — not constrained by what has been — rise up, often with new technologies or processes. Think Netflix targeting through-the-mail subscribers versus Blockbuster's in-store model.Many turned to this book to explain the dot-com boom that helped usher in the current crop of Silicon Valley heroes. There are rough parallels today.Just as the internet was a new technology that could do lots of things, AI holds many promises. But in these early innings, it isn't clear how AI will be deployed — or by whom or when.Pets.com, for example, wasn't the winner many thought. That's the rub. Even Christensen had a hard time predicting disrupters, like Apple's iPhone.When the gadget came out in 2007, the Harvard professor didn't see it as a threat to phones. In fact, the device ushered in a new era of mobile computing and the App Economy.That app marketplace, however, might look a lot different if companies are reaching customers in different ways . AI agents, for example, could upend the App Store way of the world.So far, Apple's answer to AI has appeared to be heavy on the hype. ""We just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar,"" Cook told investors during Apple's recent earnings call about the delay.At least Google has an AI assistant, Gemini, though it's unclear if that chatbot will be enough to save its real business — advertising, which accounted for most of its revenue last year. That's a lot of ads sold off users clicking on links in a world where people increasingly ask a chatbot their questions, like: What is ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" about?Still, it might be surprising that no dominant platform seems to have a winning formula just yet.That gives hope to the likes of Sarah Guo, a young venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. She is trying to make her mark by investing in the next hot AI startup that might dethrone the big dogs.""There are many claims you can make strategically about why a company shouldn't exist: because Microsoft should build it or Apple should build or Google should build it,"" she told me during the recent episode of the "" Bold Names"" podcast. But, often for these established companies, she said, it can be hard ""being creative with a risky new product.""Just ask Google. The early days of Gemini were marred by apologies and promises to do better after its chat responses were seen as biased and — according to CEO Sundar Pichai — unacceptable. The rollout occurred amid concerns that startup OpenAI was ahead in the space, even though Google had been working on AI for a long while.""No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry's development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes,"" Pichai wrote at the time.Sometimes big breakthrough innovations, which we want to call disruptive, in fact help sustain existing businesses.Microsoft — with a market value that has again surpassed Apple — is looking pretty savvy having embraced AI for its workplace products. Nvidia, too, has been a big beneficiary of AI companies gobbling up its high-price chips needed for developing their models.Yet the emergence of China's DeepSeek and other new AI models that supposedly use far less pricey computing power raise new questions. It remains unclear where the value of the new technology will land.It's all such a dilemma.

Can S&P 500 ETFs Continue Their Winning Streak?,1746201600000,"After enduring a sharp downturn in early April due to aggressive U.S. tariff policies, the S&P 500 has staged a remarkable comeback. The index is on the verge of notching its longest winning streak since 2004, after registering its eighth consecutive winning session on Thursday. This underscores a renewed wave of investor confidence in the face of lingering economic uncertainty. The three ultra-popular ETFs tracking the index — Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV — gained about 6% each in the last eight days.The surge was primarily driven by strong earnings reports from major technology firms and easing concerns over trade tensions. Will the strong trend continue? Let’s delve deeper:Big Tech Earnings Lift OptimismStrong quarterly earnings reports from software giant Microsoft MSFT and Facebook parent Meta Platforms META spread strong optimism in the tech sector, the heart of the market rally last year. The dual earnings outperformance underscores that strong demand for AI is helping both companies navigate tariff-driven economic uncertainty (read: AI ETFs Set to Gain on Robust Meta, Microsoft Earnings). After the closing bell on Thursday, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL also announced quarterly results with the beat on both earnings and revenues. However, their shares are falling due to tariff uncertainties. Apple warned of a $900 million tariff headwind in the ongoing quarter. The good news is that Apple is shifting its assembly of all iPhones for the U.S. market to India as soon as next year. About 50% of iPhones for U.S. markets are now produced in India, while iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and other products are increasingly sourced from Vietnam.Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky issued a cautious outlook due to uncertain consumer demand in the face of President Trump's shifting tariff policies. Amazon faces significant exposure to Trump’s tariffs, primarily through its retail unit.Tariffs and Trade Deal TalksThe Trump administration seems to be softening its stance on tariffs, raising hopes of a resolution of the trade conflict. At a White House press conference last week, Trump called the current 145% reciprocal tariffs ""too high"" and said they would ""come down substantially."" Meanwhile, China is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the United States. According to several reports, China might suspend its 125% tariff on some U.S. goods, which boosted market sentiment.Weak Economic ReadingsThe U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years due to a monumental pre-tariff import surge. GDP declined at an annualized rate of 0.3% during the first three months, more than the 0.2% decline expected by economists surveyed by BloombergU.S. manufacturing activity shrank the most since November in April. The manufacturing PMI revealed by the Institute for Supply Management dropped to a five-month low of 48.7 in April from 49.0 in March. Further, consumer confidence hit a five-year low last month. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to 86 in April, representing its lowest reading since May 2020 and the fifth consecutive decline. The decline was due to tumbling consumers’ expectations related to business conditions, employment prospects and future income, reflecting pessimism about the economy (read: Is Weak Consumer Sentiment Hurting Discretionary ETFs?). Encouraging Jobs ReportApril jobs data shows that the U.S. labor market remained resilient amid the tariff chaos. The economy added better-than-expected 177,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.Bottom LineWhile the current momentum is encouraging, ongoing uncertainties around trade policies and economic indicators suggest that volatility may persist.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:67d272df0094b:0-can-s-p-500-etfs-continue-their-winning-streak/

Roku Stock Drops as Outlook Raises Worry About Ad Spending — Barrons.com,1746200520000,"By Angela PalumboRoku stock was sinking after the streaming-device company cut its financial guidance, saying the uncertain economic environment is hurting revenue from both streaming devices and advertising.Roku reported an adjusted first-quarter loss of 19 cents a share after the stock market closed on Thursday, while the consensus call among analysts polled by FactSet was for a loss of 26 cents. Revenue was $1.02 billion, while analysts expected $1.01 billion.Nevertheless, the stock fell 10% to $60.78 on Friday. It has lost 18% this year, compared with the 3.5% decline of the S&P 500.Management said it now expects full-year revenue of $4.55 billion, compared with the $4.61 billion it predicted in its fourth-quarter earnings release. Wall Street expected full-year revenue of $4.58 billion.The company also said it expects second-quarter revenue of $1.07 billion, compared with Wall Street's estimates of $1.09 billion.Roku sells devices that put streaming apps on a user's television. Last quarter, Roku said it expected devices revenue to grow 12% from the previous year in 2025. On Thursday, the company said ""while tariff-related impacts to our Devices segment remain difficult to predict, we expect Devices revenue and gross profit loss to remain consistent with 2024 levels.""At the same time. President Donald Trump's tariffs have left companies unsure of what the economic environment will look like in the months to come. Roku management said on a call to discuss the results that it is starting to see advertisers shifting their budgets as a result. Other tech companies, including Snap, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, have made similar comments this earnings season.""While we remain confident in Roku's ability to create opportunities in this environment with its treasure trove of user data, uncertainty on advertising budgets could linger until tariffs are removed,"" Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a note on Friday. She rates Roku as Outperform with a $100 price target.There could be one bright spot for Roku, though. CEO Anthony Wood said on the call that advertisers have been shifting their focus to streaming channels from traditional TV""The good news for ROKU is the move to streaming is a wind at the back of results and if anything the move to streaming could accelerate in a potential weakening economy as consumers look to save money,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote on Thursday.

More Young People are Using Gen AI to Plan Trips — Market Talk,1747672500000,"Even as more users look to ChatGPT, Meta AI and Google's Gemini to research products and shop, relatively few are using the platforms to plan trips, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. Younger cohorts, though, are increasingly turning to the applications for travel planning, with such usage growing at a faster clip than for their older peers in the last six months, the analysts said. Product innovation and improved commercial capabilities, like a Google digital travel agent or similar offering, will likely dictate the pace of adoption from here on out, the analysts say.

Pinterest Shows Strength in Uncertain Advertising Market — Barrons.com,1746808860000,"By Angela PalumboPinterest stock was climbing after the photo sharing platform gave better-than-expected revenue guidance despite continued uncertainty in advertising.Pinterest reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $855 million. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 26 cents a share on revenue of $846.5 million.Despite the mixed results, shares were up 5.8% in afternoon trading on Friday to $29.52.Pinterest management said on its earnings call that it expects second-quarter revenue to be between $960 million and $980 million. That is above Wall Street expectations of $958.2 million.Pinterest's strong revenue guidance is a standout since — according to the company's latest 10-K filing — it makes a substantial amount of its revenue from advertising. Other companies that rely on advertising have warned that ad spending, specifically from Asia-based companies, is showing signs of weakness.This comes after the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed low-cost items to come into the U.S. without being exposed to tariffs.Asia-based companies spend a lot on advertising their inexpensive products, and if customers shop those products less as they increase in price, advertisers may pull back spending.Fellow social media company Snap also makes a lot of money from advertising, but withheld second-quarter guidance ""given the uncertainty with respect to how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead."" Meta Platforms and Alphabet also noted during their latest earnings conference calls that they are seeing weakness with Asia-based advertiser spending.Pinterest CFO Julia Donnelly said on the earnings call that the company has seen a reduction in ""spend from Asia-based e-commerce retailers in the U.S. given the change in the de minimis exemption.""""However, we've also seen a geographic diversification from some of those Asia-based retailers to our European and Rest of World user regions.

Infrastructure Surge to Lift Sterling Q1 Earnings: Buy or Hold?,1746198120000,"Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 5, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, Sterling delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9% and growing 13.2% year over year. Revenues grew 3% year over year to $498.8 million. Despite falling slightly short of guided revenue, the company managed to outperform in key profitability metrics, demonstrating its ongoing commitment to margin expansion. Gross margin for the quarter surpassed 21%, while adjusted EBITDA and operating income also expanded meaningfully, reinforcing the company's focus on execution and disciplined cost control.Sterling, a premier U.S. service provider specializing in transportation, civil construction, and e-infrastructure solutions, has an impressive track record of surpassing earnings expectations, exceeding the consensus mark in each of the last four quarters. The average surprise over this period is 16.2%, as shown in the chart below.How Are Estimates Placed for STRL?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter EPS has remained unchanged at $1.58 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a whopping 58% growth from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is $415.6 million, indicating a 5.6% year-over-year decline.For 2025, STRL is expected to register 34.6% EPS growth from a year ago. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)What the Zacks Model Unveils for SterlingOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Sterling for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: STRL has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Influencing Sterling’s Q1 PerformanceSterling has established itself as a major player in the booming e-infrastructure and transportation markets. The company’s strategic focus on high-margin projects, coupled with strong execution, has led to record earnings growth so far. With a robust backlog, ongoing federal infrastructure spending, and rising demand for data centers, Sterling appears well-positioned for another strong quarter.However, as is typical for Sterling, the first quarter is expected to be the company’s lowest revenue quarter of the year due to seasonal trends.Segment-wise, E-Infrastructure Solutions, STRL's largest and fastest-growing segment, accounted for 47% of fourth-quarter 2024 revenues. Its customers include Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Walmart Inc. WMT and Hyundai Motor Group. It is set to benefit from multi-year capital deployment in data centers, advanced manufacturing, and industrial sectors. Enhanced supply chain dynamics and a focus on large-scale, mission-critical projects will boost sales and margins. Data centers, now 50% of STRL’s E-Infrastructure backlog, play a crucial role in future growth, driven by the demand for AI technology advancements.Transportation Solutions segment (which accounted for 35% of total fourth-quarter 2024 revenues) is expected to benefit from strong broad-based demand and margin growth across its entire geographic footprint. The segment is expected to have benefited from robust state and local funding, the Infrastructure Bill's allocation of $643 billion for transportation programs (including $284 billion in incremental funding), and a $25 billion investment in airports over five years.Sterling’s Building Solutions segment (which accounted for 18% of total fourth-quarter 2024 revenues) is focusing on concrete foundations for residential and commercial projects. While Sterling’s overall outlook is strong, challenges persist in the residential construction market. Affordability concerns and high interest rates have kept potential homebuyers on the sidelines, limiting demand. Also, weather disruptions in Dallas and Fort Worth significantly hampered operations early in the quarter.Acquisitions have significantly contributed to STRL's growth by expanding its operations and boosting revenues. Strategic investments for profitability and efficient service execution, along with accretive buyouts, are anticipated to have driven substantial fourth-quarter growth.STRL Stock’s Price PerformanceSTRL stock has exhibited an upward movement in the past month and outperformed the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry and the broader Construction sector, as you can see below.Sterling’s 1-Month Price PerformanceSterling Stock’s 50-Day & 200-Day Moving AveragesSterling’s stock is trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). This suggests the stock has positive price momentum over both the short-to-medium term (50-day SMA) and long term (200-day SMA).Let's assess the value STRL offers to investors at its current levels. Despite the solid rally, STRL is trading slightly at a discount compared to the industry average, as shown in the chart below. The stock is trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 17.4—lower than the Zacks Engineering - R&D Services industry average of 17.73 but well above its five-year median of 11.33.Sterling’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) vs. IndustryWhy Should You Hold STRL Stock Now?As the infrastructure sector continues to grow, Sterling stands to benefit significantly due to its strong industry reputation and extensive experience with top-tier clients. The current capacity for data centers falls far short of meeting the rising demand driven by artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Sterling remains well-positioned due to its consistent earnings outperformance, strong margin execution, and exposure to growth drivers like data centers and infrastructure spending. Despite expected seasonal softness in the first quarter, full-year EPS is projected to grow more than 34% in 2025, backed by a robust backlog and strategic acquisitions.The stock’s upward momentum, trading above its 50- and 200-day moving averages, reinforces investor confidence. With a forward P/E of 17.4—slightly below the industry average—valuation remains reasonable. STRL reflects a balanced risk-reward profile at current levels.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e783aa41f094b:0-infrastructure-surge-to-lift-sterling-q1-earnings-buy-or-hold/
META: Meta Stock Can’t Rebound for Days After News Native ‘Behemoth’ AI Model Is Delayed,1747641865000,"Is Zuckerberg in trouble or is that another opportunity to buy the dip in big tech? According to WSJ, Meta’s engineers can’t come up with anything impressive for the launch of Behemoth. 📢 Meta Stock Can’t Catch a Break- Meta stock NASDAQ:META can’t shake off the selling pressure after it was slammed by investors on Thursday when a bad report came out. A Wall Street Journal story revealed internal struggles over the company’s flagship “Behemoth” AI model. - Shares of Meta dropped 0.6% on Friday, extending their Thursday loss of 2.4% when the news broke out. - Touted as the company’s jewel of Meta’s AI crown, the “Behemoth” project is now getting delayed. An April release got pushed back to May and the May release is now pushed back to fall or later. 🔥 Internal Troubles Loom- Engineers at the big tech giants, the WSJ said, can’t figure out how to make the model better so they’ve decided it’s not worthy of a push live just yet. What’s worse, and maybe more concerning, is that 11 of the 14 researchers who built the OG Llama model have bailed and are no longer with the Facebook owner. - Meta’s AI initiatives have been supporting the stock’s upside swing for months (if not a couple years already). In its latest earnings report, Zuckerberg’s tech titan raised its capital expenditures (capex) for 2025 to $72 billion from $60 billion , focusing the lion’s share of that pile of cash on AI gigs. 🔑 Meta’s Stock Performance- While the stock has been in a mild selloff mode, some money spinners have switched on their buy-the-dip mode. Loop Capital, for one, slapped a bullish price target on Meta stock Friday, predicting a 40% upside to $888 per share from the current $640 a pop. - Year to date, Meta stock has been doing much like the rest of the Magnificent Seven club — not too great.

Why Nearly 20 Analysts Raised Meta Price Targets Post-Earnings,1746802020000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META rewarded investors with another strong post-earnings gain on May 1 . Shares rose over 4% after the release , and the company’s results extended its streak of beating expectations. Meta has now beaten Wall Street's sales estimates for 11 straight quarters . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] It also exceeded expectations for  adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the ninth quarter in a row . Overall, shares have gained by an average of more than 5% post-earnings over the last 10 quarters .However, a higher share price was far from the only good news investors received. According to forecasts tracked by MarketBeat, nearly 20 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the tech giant. To be fair, several individuals lowered their targets. Still, three times as many boosted them.So, what is driving the majority of analysts to become more bullish on Meta , and exactly how much upside do they see?JPMorgan Sees Good Reason for Meta’s Increased CapExOne major announcement coming from Meta was the company raising its capital expenditure (CapEx) guidance for 2025. Meta has been using CapEx spending to invest significantly in AI infrastructure that supports the growth of its business. Critics have targeted big tech companies for their tens of billions in CapEx spending on AI. However, Meta has been demonstrating extensive gains due to the implementation of AI in its advertising platform. Wall Street analysts are noticing this and showing support for Meta’s higher CapEx spending plans. The success of Meta’s AI initiatives is a key reason many are raising their price targets.Even though more CapEx spending means more cash leaving Meta’s pockets, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE:JPM expressed confidence in this move. They highlighted the company’s “solid results and execution along its AI roadmap” and its “ambitious long-term goals” as justifications for the higher spending.Analysts at Stifel noted Meta’s ongoing investment in artificial intelligence as a key driver of future growth. Piper Sandler believes that Meta’s AI initiatives are “a key factor in the company’s forward momentum."" They stated that the higher CapEx spending aims to fast-track the development and rollout of the technology needed for these initiatives. Truist Securities added that “Meta continues to justify its right to invest.""The fact that people are seeing more ads on Meta and that marketers are spending more on each ad provides evidence of Meta’s strong AI execution. From Q1 2023 to Q1 2025, the number of ad impressions on Meta’s apps is up by around 26% , indicating that marketers are buying a higher volume of ads. Comparing the same two periods, the price paid per ad is up around 17% . In economics, higher prices typically mean that demand should fall. The fact that Meta is raising its ad prices while also seeing higher ad demand demonstrates the huge value that marketers are getting out of its platform. Meta’s AI investments have led to significantly more time spent on its apps. This is a key reason why marketers are willing to direct more ads to them while also paying a higher price .Citi Sees Added AI Clarity as a Positive [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C brought up another key point. Meta laid out the five major growth opportunities it is pursuing through its AI strategy. This was the first time that Meta explained this in a structured format. Those opportunities are: “improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.""Analysts at Citi noted that this clear plan “strengthened confidence in [Meta’s] continued growth trajectory."" Although this may not seem like a big deal, companies often get rewarded for providing clarity around their business .Doing so allows investors to understand how well a company is actually executing. If a company executes well, this can lead to higher multiples. Because Meta is doing just that, adding clarity is a positive. However, it could also backfire if Meta stops executing well.Updated Targets Indicate Nearly 20% Upside in MetaOn average, Wall Street analyst price target updates tracked by MarketBeat after the May 1 earnings release indicate significant 12-month return potential in Meta shares. Compared to the stock’s May 8 closing price of just under $598 per share , these updates imply that shares could rise by over 18%.Overall, the rise in price targets for Meta comes down to one key point: the company is delivering strong results with its AI strategy .

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/
Meta's AI Power Play: The Mastermind Returns to Shake Up the Game,1746793158000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META is doubling down on AI and it's bringing back one of its original architects to lead the charge. Robert Fergus, who co-founded Meta's AI research lab FAIR back in 2014, is stepping in as its new head.

Senate Is Set to Pass a Stablecoin Bill. Rules for Crypto Exchanges Will Be Harder. — Barrons.com,1747433880000,"By Joe LightThe crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.As soon as Monday, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets like Treasury bills. Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and to give coin holders priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy.Stablecoins underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Rather than pay cash for a token, traders typically use stablecoins, which together have a market value of about $250 billion. The largest such token, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global.While stablecoins are currently used primarily for trading, issuers believe they could soon be a serious challenger to traditional payments networks. Their expectation is that they could also save consumers billions of dollars in fees on remittances and other expensive cross-border transactions.The bill requires 60 votes to move through the Senate, and earlier this month, it appeared the GENIUS Act would sail through with bipartisan support. Even though some Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), have been skeptical of the crypto industry push, many other lawmakers have warmed to the industry. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions and lobbying.The bill's recent troubles have hinged on two major issues. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. A second issue is President Donald Trump's business arrangements with the industry.A revised draft of the bill appears to throw up a roadblock to tech companies issuing stablecoins by requiring nonfinancial public companies to get special approval from a committee. However, the new bill doesn't address concerns that Trump and his family could directly profit from the tokens through its majority ownership of crypto firm World Liberty Financial, which has issued a stablecoin called USD1.A memo, titled ""Negotiations Win Summary,"" circulated among Democratic senators earlier this week, touting ""major victories"" won since early May, including the new Big Tech language. However, it remains to be seen whether the changes will be enough to ensure passage. The bill is expected to have an easier time in the House of Representatives, which won't require a supermajority for approval.A bigger problem for the crypto industry is what the stablecoin bill's troubles could mean for a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and the thousands of issuers of crypto tokens. During former President Joe Biden's administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase — as well as other exchanges and token issuers — for allegedly violating securities laws, charges that Coinbase denied.Trump's SEC promptly dismissed those cases with prejudice, meaning the same cases can't be brought back later. But there is a fear that a future administration could come back with similar allegations if a new law governing crypto market structure doesn't make clear what does and doesn't fall under the SEC's remit.""After this, getting market structure is even more important,"" said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on a conference panel this week with Gillibrand and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.).How to police crypto exchanges and issuers is a more controversial issue than stablecoins, even within the industry itself. Among the issues are how to decide when a token is sufficiently ""decentralized"" for it not to be subject to securities laws.Apart from the stablecoin venture, Trump or his family own or have ties to a Bitcoin mining firm, several ""meme"" coins and so-called nonfungible tokens, and a venture to launch crypto exchange-traded funds, giving many more reasons for Democrats to blanch at the swift passage of a comprehensive crypto bill.It took several near-death experiences for lawmakers potentially to squeak through stablecoin legislation. That might prove to have been the easy part.Write to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump Makes a Deal With the U.K. Now Comes the Hard Part. — Barrons.com,1746721080000,"By Joe Light, Reshma Kapadia, Brian Swint, and George GloverPresident Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday announced a trade deal with the U.K., the first since April. Despite a strong market reaction to the news, the details don't signal the start of substantial relief on tariffs.The deal will increase imports of U.S. agricultural products like ethanol, beef, and machinery, said Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a press conference. It will lower U.S. tariffs on some steel and auto imports from the U.K., Lutnick said. Importantly, it will leave in place the 10% ""baseline"" tariff that the U.S. unveiled in April.Trump said the 10% baseline tariff is as low as the U.K. and other countries will see.Also, Lutnick announced that a U.K. company also agreed to buy $10 billion worth of airplanes from Boeing.""It's so good for both countries,"" Trump said, who added that the details will be finalized in ""coming weeks."" Trump has called the deal ""a full and comprehensive"" arrangement with the U.K. that will be the ""first of many.""The stock market extended its rally after the press conference. As of midday Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 1.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4%. Trump said he expected the market ""to really rally"" with the U.K. announcement, at one point advising investors they ""better go out and buy stocks now.""Trump said he was ""very close"" to striking more trade deals and pushed back on the idea that the U.K. deal was announced prematurely before many details had been hammered out.In a TruthSocial post, Trump said that the agreement will increase exports to the U.K. by $5 billion, while increasing market access for cereals, fruits, vegetables, soft drinks and chemicals, among other products. The post said that up to 100,000 of U.K. car imports would be subject to the 10% baseline tariff, as opposed to the increased tariffs on autos.Trump Says Talks With China Will Be Very SubstantiveThe U.K. deal comes just before talks with one of the U.S.'s biggest trade partners are set to begin.Trump said talks with China this weekend will be ""very substantive."" When asked if tariffs on the country could come down, he said they ""can't get any higher.""Many analysts have expected this weekend's meeting between U.S. officials and China to be more of an icebreaker. But Trump said: ""China wants to do something.""Trump also indicated that he might speak with Xi after the talks and that he might also be willing to reduce tariffs after the talks. A lot is riding on these talks, which could thaw the escalation between the two countries that has brought trade to almost a halt. Tariffs on Chinese imports are at 145% and Chinese imports on U.S. goods are at 125%.Trump also stressed he wants China to open up its markets to the U.S., and that would be among the topics Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would bring up at this weekend's talks. ""It would be great for friendship. People think I'm a militant guy. I'm not. Trade can bring greater friendship with China."" That runs counter to the growing concerns of a decoupling between the U.S. and China, fueled by some of the more hawkish members of the administration.The U.K. deal could fuel Chinese officials' fear that Trump keeps renegotiating deals even after one is struck. Peter Mandelson, U.K. Ambassador to the U.S., noted Trump's ""11th hour intervention"" phone call where he demanded ""even more out of this deal than we anticipated.""While both sides heralded the deal, details have yet to be ironed out. Trump said that, ""Over time, there will be adjustments made because we are flexible and think we could do better.""Trump Says U.K. Trade Deal Is First of Many. It Will Only Get Harder.The hope is that this is the start of a streak of bilateral agreements that will substantially bring down overall tariff levels before Trump's ""Liberation Day"" taxes take effect July 8. But there are good reasons the U.K. deal was the quickest and easiest to complete, and it doesn't necessarily guide the way for others.For one, the stakes are relatively low. Trump views trade deficits as damaging to the U.S., but America actually ran a surplus with Britain in the fourth quarter. To be sure, that was the first time that had happened since 2011, excluding the volatile quarters of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it shows that the U.K. sells only about as much to the U.S. as it buys.If Trump wants to get trade deficits down, a deal with the the U.K. won't make a big dent.Beyond that, the U.K. is only the fifth-biggest buyer of U.S. exports, behind Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. And that doesn't account for the European Union, which represents 20 countries including Germany and France and which will be negotiating as a bloc.Second, the U.K. has some low-hanging fruit to offer as concessions. Besides easing restrictions on food and agricultural imports from the U.S., Britain also imposes a 2% tax on revenues of search engines, social media, and online markets that make money from U.K. users. That hits Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Google parent Alphabet.The details of the U.K. deal have yet to be announced, but it isn't obvious what other countries with trade surpluses with the U.S., such as China, India, and Vietnam, can put on the table.To be sure, Thursday's news is good news, especially for the British car, aerospace and pharmaceutical companies that export a lot to the U.S., such as Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, and AstraZeneca. Spirits maker Diageo, the owner of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Tanqueray gin, must also be breathing a sigh of relief.It's also a sign that deals are possible. But the real relief won't come until the Trump administration reaches agreements with even bigger trade partners.Maersk Cuts Container Market OutlookA.P. Moeller-Maersk stood by its full-year earnings guidance Thursday, but warned that trade tensions could hit global container market volumes.The Danish shipping giant still expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between $6 billion and $9 billion in 2025, but is now forecasting global container volume growth of between a 1% fall and a 4% rise. It had previously expected an expansion of 4%.""With trade tensions flaring up and uncertainty on the rise, global supply chains are once again in the spotlight,"" CEO Vincent Clerc said.The company's results are typically seen as a bellwether for global trade, so its gloomy forecast on volumes will do nothing to ease fears that ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China will weigh on demand. Maersk shares slid 1.4% in early trading.Toyota Warns Tariffs Will Dent ProfitToyota said that its annual profit will plunge on Thursday, warning that U.S. tariffs could dent its bottom line.The Japanese car maker's quarterly earnings topped analysts' forecasts, but it now expects its profit for the current fiscal year to tumble 35% to 3.1 trillion yen ($21.4 billion). It said the impact of Trump's levies in April and May had ""been tentatively factored in"" to its forecast for now. Toyota's American depositary receipts dropped 2.2% in early trading.Trump on Thursday lambasted Mattel and other companies that have said they plan to raise prices in response to tariffs or that have threatened to go to other countries. ""Let them go and we'll put 100% of tariffs on his toys and they won't sell one toy in the United States,"" said Trump, arguing that companies and countries can pick up the cost of tariffs rather than consumers.Tariffs Keep Fed on HoldWednesday's press conference following the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision confirmed that tariffs are the greatest unknown for policymakers. Chair Jerome Powell and colleagues kept rates on hold and said they're waiting before making the next move.For now, the economy is strong enough to give the Fed time. Markets are pricing in an 80% chance for another decision for unchanged rates in June and a 55% chance of a quarter-point cut in July.At Thursday's deal announcement, Trump continued to rail on Powell for not cutting rates, arguing that it would be like ""jet fuel"" if the Fed lowered rates and saying that Powell was always ""too late"" in interest-rate decisions.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tesla Stock Rises.

It also exited a 670,000-share Meta Platforms stake while buying 1.45 million shares of Nvidia, among other shifts.Investors like to follow what large, successful fund managers are doing, but changes don't always move stocks significantly.

The streak started with an 18% jump the week Tesla reported first-quarter earnings. Numbers were weaker than expected but the company stuck to its timelines for a lower-priced model and for a robotaxi service. The latter is due to start in Austin, Texas, in June.Easing trade tensions between China and the U.S., which boosted most shares, also helped, pointed out Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster in a recent tweet.""Ride-hailing is a massive opportunity,"" he wrote.

Meta's 5 Key Pillars for AI Growth—Zuckerberg's Bold Vision,1747420380000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] In its last earnings call, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META made a concerted effort to add more transparency around its AI strategy .Mark Zuckerberg laid out the “ five major opportunities ” the company is pursuing through its AI investments. Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C called this out as a significant positive .Understanding these opportunities is crucial to assessing whether the tech giant is living up to expectations going forward.How effectively Meta capitalizes on them will likely influence both investor confidence and the company’s long-term growth trajectory.Opportunities for the Here and Now: Advertising & App ExperiencesThe first opportunity is “ improved advertising ."" This is what Meta has already been doing and generating its great financial results from. The company essentially wants to make it as easy as possible for businesses to get customers.Meta’s technology is learning how to show the right ad to the right person at the right time . As it gets better, advertisers are paying more money per ad , demonstrating the value they are receiving. The company’s AI ad creation tools also saw 30% more usage last quarter. This shows that the tools are likely making it easier for marketers to create ads.The second opportunity is “more engaging experiences."" Essentially, Meta wants to increase the amount of time spent and the level of interaction with content on its apps. This would raise the value of advertising on Meta as users focus more on its apps than on other platforms. The company shares that  improvements to its content recommendation systems have led to a 6% to 35% increase in time spent on its various apps.Facebook started as a place where people shared mostly through written posts. However, image—and video-based content are far more engaging. Zuckerberg sees content progressing even further. People and the content they are watching will interact back and forth with each other in real time. He believes AI will be key in enabling the creation of this type of content. Seeing tangible examples of creators producing this type of content and successfully increasing engagement will be vital.Emerging Opportunities: Messaging Monetization, Meta AI, AI GlassesThe next opportunity is “business messaging.""   Billions of users and messages are sent across Meta’s WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram apps. However, messaging on these platforms is largely unmonetized at this point. Zuckerberg sees a future where companies generate sales through direct messaging customers. Companies in Thailand and Vietnam already do this extensively.However, they use human employees because the labor cost in these countries is low. Companies can use AI agents to message people to make this profitable in developed countries. This could create a large monetization opportunity for Meta.

"Wall Street opens with gains as US-UK finalize trade deal, tech stocks rally",1746712836000,"Wall Street saw optimism in early trade on Thursday, May 8, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and U.K. have agreed on a trade deal.At 7.20 pm IST or 9.50 am ET, the Dow Jones index was higher by 185 points or 0.45 percent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 100 points or 0.55 percent, while the broader S&P 500 index ticked up 25 points or 0.45 percent.“The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,"" said President Trump, in a post on Truth Social.The U.S. President will reveal further details at 10 am ET. Trump also added that there are more deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation.Tech stocks gained on Wednesday following reports that the Trump administration plans to roll back upcoming AI chip restrictions introduced under the Biden administration. The controls were set to take effect later this month.Chipmakers led the rally, with Intel jumping 3.3 percent, AMD rising over 3 percent, and Nvidia edging up 0.5 percent. Among megacaps, Meta and Amazon gained more than 1 percent, while Tesla surged more than 3 percent.In the previous session, Wall Street ended with gains, after a volatile session, marked by sharp swings from gains to losses. The volatility was sparked by Trump saying he wouldn't preemptively cut the tariff levied on China, amid the ongoing negotiations. Further, the US Federal Reserve left its benchmark lending rate unchanged, in the range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent.According to U.S. Federal Reserve Chair, inflation in the U.S. may see an uptick, growth momentum could slow while unemployment rises, if U.S. President Donald Trump's broad-based tariffs are implemented.Further, President Trump announced that he would not preemptively reduce tariffs on China to kickstart trade negotiations with Beijing. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent along with officials would meet Chinese officials in Switzerland this week, signaling possible progress on trade talks after last month’s tariff turmoil. “We’ve got to deescalate before we move forward,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The Next Generation of AI Remains Elusive. All That CapEx Has Yet to Pay Off. — Barrons.com,1747414500000,"By Adam LevineOn Thursday The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platform's largest and most ambitious AI language model, Llama 4 Behemoth, would be delayed for the second time. Meta stock fell on the news, finishing Thursday down 2.4%.In delaying its next generation of language models, Meta has good company in AI start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic.OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 came out in November 2022 and shocked the world with its capabilities; it was the spark that set the AI world ablaze. Just a few months later, it released the much larger GPT-4, a big leap in capabilities.Observers projected this rate of progress into the future, leading to bold predictions of superintelligent computers within just a few years.But it's been two years since GPT-4's release, and GPT-5 is nowhere to be found. Anthropic announced a new Claude model, Opus, last June. It, too, isn't ready.Meta's Behemoth is set to be by far the largest AI model Meta has produced, and it looks like it is running into the same walls that OpenAI and Anthropic hit. The report from the Wall Street Journal said that Meta staffers were questioning ""whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release.""A Meta spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The company didn't respond to a request for comment from Barron's.With new large-language models bumping into technical roadblocks, the AI model makers have had to find other ways to make their chatbots perform better. New ""reasoning"" models, like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek r1, have long internal dialogues with themselves and work through problems step-by-step, checking itself as it goes along. They work well, but they're very slow.For example, Barron's asked OpenAI o3, ""Explain how much Meta is spending on AI data centers, and how much their pre-training runs for Llama 4 Behemoth cost."" o3 spent over four minutes talking to itself before spitting about a thousand-word answer. Meanwhile, all that ""thinking"" costs money; for developers, o3 is five times more expensive than OpenAI's best non-reasoning model.New, larger models offer the hope of an o3-type response, without four minutes of thinking.The disappointment from Meta investors on Thursday is compounded by the massive amounts of money the company is spending to make a new model happen. After spending $14 billion in capital expenditures in the first quarter, Meta projected it would spend another $50 billion to $58 billion on AI data centers in the remaining nine months of 2025. Training runs to create these very large models are expensive; Meta's research and development costs for the first quarter were up by 22% from the year before.Investors are still wondering when the payoff for all this investment comes. Advertising is the likely path for Meta to monetize AI, given that 98% of its total 2024 revenue came from advertising.But it's not on the near horizon. ""Our initial focus for Meta AI is really about building a great consumer experience, and that's frankly where all of our energies are kind of directed to right now,"" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Meta's fourth quarter earnings call. ""There will, I think, be pretty clear monetization opportunities here over time.""More recently, CEO Mark Zuckerberg sounded optimistic about Meta's return on investment when it comes to AI spending. After laying out a range of monetization possibilities, he said, ""We don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.""Shares of Meta were down 1.4% in mid-day trading on Friday.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta",1746696240000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 8, 2025– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Q2 earnings estimates for the Tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier.""Tech Earnings Estimates Increase Again: What's Going On?Note: The following is an excerpt from this week'sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 419 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.2% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 73.7% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates. - We continue to believe that this earnings season is less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. This is starting to show up in declining estimates for the coming periods. - For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down more than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters. - Q2 earnings estimates for the Tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier.What's Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates?The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariffs uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +6.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter last month, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have also declined since the quarter got underway.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.8% in Q2 on +9.9% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed in recent days.In last week's report, regular readers saw this reversal in the Tech sector's revisions trend when we shared the evolution of the sector's full-year earnings growth expectations.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector's estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector's Q2 estimates at least prove that the shift to the annual growth pace isn't solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly the Mag 7 players that reported last week. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT , Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company's current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.We will be closely monitoring this curious turn in Tech sector estimates.The Earnings Big Picture While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven't been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy's growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?,1747413720000,"Income-hungry investors have been piling into ETFs that use options to deliver juicy dividends. We've seen a surge in launches of these products recently, as providers employ innovative strategies to package derivatives within the ETF structure to meet rising investor demand.In addition to offering high yields, these strategies generally help reduce portfolio volatility. However, investors should remember that there’s no free lunch in investing. These products tend to perform best in sideways markets and often underperform during strong bull runs. That said, they can provide some downside protection when stocks fall.Quantitative Researcher Roni Israelov refers to these strategies as a “Devil’s Bargain.” His research shows that trading options to generate income can undermine long-term investment returns.This paper is Roni’s personal research and not a work product of Citadel.Our own analysis of the most popular derivatives-backed ETFs also suggests that investors may be leaving significant returns on the table in their pursuit of high income. Nevertheless, these products have attracted substantial inflows this year, as market volatility has shaken investor confidence.The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses proprietary research to select around 130 stocks and writes S&P 500 Index call options to generate income. Its top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META.JEPI and its sister fund, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, are among the top asset gatherers this year.The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO aims to deliver high income from both dividends and covered calls. Its managers focus on high-quality large-cap companies with a history of dividend growth and write covered calls on individual stocks.While DIVO has outperformed JEPI, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term on a total return basis.JEPQ and the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD continue to underperform the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d14073830094b:0-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-options-income-etfs/

Why this investment bank sees more than 30% upside on Meta,1747400441000,"Investment banking firm Loop Capital maintained its bullish stance on Meta platforms with a target price of $888.This indicates a 38% upside from Thursday’s closing price.AI performance Loop Capital’s analysts said that Facebook’s parent company’s artificial intelligence-driven performance has made up for the drop in spending from Chinese advertisers. “We continue to see Meta as the best non-hardware example of tangible, right-now beneficiary of AI and think the stock will outperform the ‘mag-7’ peer group this year,” Loop Capital Analyst Rob Sanderson said. The analyst said the stock will be a beneficiary of non-hardware example of being a beneficiary of AI.The company increased its capital expenditure outlook for 2025 to invest more in data centres for AI. Meta plans to invest $72 billion in capital expenditure this year. While the analyst noted that current core AI investments are constrained by capacity, new data centre AI capacity is coming online. A behemoth concernThis positive note comes after a Wall Street Journal report said that Meta is delaying the rollout of its “Behemoth” large language model. The Behemoth model was first slated to come out in April 2025 but was later pushed to June and now to fall or later, the report said. According to the report, Meta’s engineers were concerned that Behemoth’s performance couldn’t match what the company’s public statements. Meta had touted that Behemoth outperformed similar AI models of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic in some tests. After the report came, Meta’s stock fell over 2% on Thursday. FTC monopoly caseMeta recently asked a federal judge to drop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) case against the company. The company argued that the FTC failed to prove the antitrust case. FTC had accused Meta of dominating the social media market by buying out rival companies such as Instagram and WhatsApp to buy out the competition.The trial started in April, and the FTC is trying to show Meta was trying to buy out the competition a decade ago by pointing out emails of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg worrying about Instagram and WhatsApp’s growth. If the judge doesn’t drop the case, the trial may run into June as Meta is now presenting its own evidence against the charges. Meta stock continues to shineMeta stock has gained over 7% in the year so far, emerging as the second-best-performing stock among the magnificent seven cohort of stocks in that period. Microsoft is the best performing stock with a 8% gain and Apple has been the worst performing among the group with a 13% decline. Meta’s shares had gained over 28% in the last month as investors cheered strong Q1 results. The company had posted a 16% increase in revenue to $42.31 billion against an expected $41.40 billion. Its net income surged 35% to $16.64 billion.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:9ce1d334c094b:0-why-this-investment-bank-sees-more-than-30-upside-on-meta/
"AI Is Hitting Search Traffic, Testimony Suggests. Google Stock Falls. — Barrons.com",1746648780000,"By Angela PalumboAlphabet stock fell sharply after Bloomberg reported that an Apple executive's testimony pointed to artificial intelligence taking market share from traditional search.Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, testified in a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google that searches in Apple browsers fell for the first time as people turn to AI for their search queries, according to Bloomberg.This comes as the Justice Department investigates a longstanding partnership between Apple and Alphabet, in which Alphabet pays billions for Apple to use Google as its default search partner.Apple, Alphabet, and the Justice Department didn't respond to requests for comment.Shares of Alphabet closed down 7.3% as the testimony fueled investor concerns that Google might lose its crown as the king of search. Rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, and Meta AI offer increasingly popular alternatives.In 2024, Alphabet added a warning to the risk section of its 10-K annual report. ""Other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy,"" the company said in the filing.Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes rates Alphabet as a Hold with a $166 price target. He wrote in a note on Wednesday that ""today could be a historic turning point in Alphabet sentiment.""""Just trust your eyes and ears — people are going to ChatGPT (and others) for search-equivalent queries more and more,"" Reitzes said.Meanwhile, in August, a U.S. judge ruled that Google was a monopolist in general search services and general text advertising. One potential remedy to that search monopoly could prevent the exclusive agreements that have made Google the default search engine on different devices, including the iPhone.Shares of Apple, whose profits would take a hit were it to lose the Google search deal, were down 1.1% Wednesday.Bloomberg also reported on Wednesday that Cue wants Google to remain the default for Safari. But Cue said Apple has had discussions with Perplexity to add the AI search company's offering to Safari, as well.Perplexity didn't respond to a request for comment.Apple and ChatGPT-parent OpenAI announced a partnership in June.

AppLovin and Boise Cascade have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1747398960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares AppLovin Corp. APP as the Bull of the Day and Boise Cascade BCC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AppLovin Corp. APP, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:AppLovin Corp. is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level.AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more.Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth.The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26.Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices.APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s 360% and Meta’s 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.Bear of the Day:Boise Cascade is one of the top North American producers of engineered wood products and plywood. BCC stock has tanked over 20% in 2025, driven by macroeconomic challenges, industry-specific headwinds, and operational pressures.The engineered wood products powerhouse missed our Q1 2025 earnings estimate by 22% on May 5. It also offered disappointing guidance as part of Boise Cascade’s extended trend of downward EPS revisions.What’s Going On with BCC Stock?Boise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022, before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and a slowing housing market.The company’s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively.Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted earnings dropped 59% YoY in the first quarter to $1.06 a share, missing our estimate by 22%. CEO Nate Jorgensen pointed to “constrained demand, difficult weather, and planned downtime at our Oakdale veneer and plywood mill” as part of its rough quarter and downbeat outlook.Boise Cascade's consensus 2025 earnings estimate has dropped 18% since its Q1 report. Its 2026 estimate has slipped 13% since then, and its overall negative earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company’s earnings are projected to fall another 31% YoY in 2025 on 2% lower sales.Stay Away from Boise Cascade Stock for Now?Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. The company also pays dividends and has a sturdy balance sheet.Investors might want to put Boise Cascade on their watchlists since it could be a longer-term winner. Unfortunately, BCC faces near-term headwinds driven by weak housing market demand, economic uncertainty, and more.Additional content:AppLovin Stock Plunges -26% in 3 Months: Is It a Buy Now?AppLovin Corp. has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry’s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP’s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin’s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand.Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP’s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the previous years.APP Is a BuyAPP presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its impressive financial performance and robust growth prospects.

The segment accounted for 11.1% of total revenues.The decline can be attributed to a gradual recovery in demand across various markets, including test and measurement, communications, and aerospace.

Market Chatter: Meta Faces Growing Scrutiny Over Surge in Online Scams,1747395744000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META is struggling to curb widespread fraud across Facebook and Instagram, including fake ads and marketplace scams, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing internal documents and regulators. Banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and global watchdogs have reportedly flagged Meta's role in a rising number of financial scams, with some banks reporting that nearly half of Zelle scam reports originated on its platforms. Despite repeated internal warnings and mounting losses to users, Meta has been slow to implement stricter ad verification and often permits known scammers to run dozens of fraudulent ads before enforcement, the WSJ reported. Meta's online Marketplace and ad system have reportedly become key tools for international criminal networks using tactics like impersonation and fraudulent giveaways to trick users, the news outlet added.

""Recent data decisively refutes the claim that 'friends-and-family sharing' insulates Meta's apps from competition from (among many others) YouTube, iMessage, and, most dramatically, TikTok — a disruptive entrant that forced Meta to transform Facebook and Instagram or risk precipitous decline,"" Meta said in a Thursday court filing.

Zuckerberg's Grand Vision: Most of Your Friends Will Be AI — WSJ,1746610200000,"By Meghan BobrowskyMark Zuckerberg wants you to have AI friends, an AI therapist and AI business agents.In Zuckerberg's vision for a new digital future, artificial-intelligence friends outnumber human companions and chatbot experiences supplant therapists, ad agencies and coders. AI will play a central role in the human experience, the Facebook co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms has said in a series of recent podcasts, interviews and public appearances.""I think people are going to want a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do,"" Zuckerberg said Tuesday during an onstage interview with Stripe co-founder and president John Collison at Stripe's annual conference.Zuckerberg said on a podcast last week that he thinks the average person wants to have more friends and connections with other people than they currently do — and that AI friends are a solution.""The average American I think has, it's fewer than three friends, three people they'd consider friends, and the average person has demand for meaningfully more, I think it's like 15 friends,"" he said in the interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.On a separate podcast with media analyst Ben Thompson, Zuckerberg continued: ""For people who don't have a person who's a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI.""When someone is making a purchase and needs to speak to a person from that business, an AI agent will be there to help them, Zuckerberg said Tuesday.The Tuesday talk capped a media blitz that included high-profile podcasts and public talks with fellow tech executives including Collison, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. While the Meta CEO has been a guest on podcasts before, the number and quick succession of appearances was rare.Zuckerberg has had mixed success predicting how people will interact with each other in the future. He struck gold with Facebook in the 2000s and made lucrative acquisitions with Instagram and WhatsApp a few years later. More than a decade later, in 2022, he declared that vast numbers of people in the future would interact in virtual worlds and with augmented reality. That bet has yet to come to fruition.The Meta CEO is now throwing resources at AI chatbots — both in its social media apps and in its hardware devices. Meta AI, as it is called, is accessible via Instagram and Facebook, as a stand-alone app and on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said Tuesday that nearly a billion people are using the feature now monthly.Zuckerberg said personalized AI isn't just about knowing basic information about a user, it's about ensuring chatbots behave as a good friend might.""You have a deep understanding of what's going on in this person's life, "" he said on Thompson's podcast.Some people, however, aren't buying into Zuckerberg's vision.""The very platforms that have led to our social isolation and being chronically online are now posing a solution to the loneliness epidemic, "" said Meghana Dhar, a former Instagram executive who thinks AI friends will only make such problems worse. ""It almost seems like the arsonist coming back and being the fireman.""Meta has allowed chatbots on its apps to offer a full range of social interaction, including ""romantic role-play,"" even with children, The Wall Street Journal reported.Stephen Schueller, a professor of psychological science at the University of California, Irvine, said AI chatbots cannot fully replace friends or therapists but there are circumstances where the bots might be helpful.""Most people don't have access to a therapist,"" he said. ""So for them, it's not chatbot versus therapist. It's chatbot versus nothing.""Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250507002724:0/

While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA.

The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft.

Court clash between Meta and NSO ends in $168 million defeat for spyware firm,1746566380000,"Meta Platforms won a $168 million verdict against the Israeli surveillance firm NSO, the company said Tuesday, capping a six-year arm wrestling match between America's biggest social networking platform and the world's best known spyware company. Meta had already won a December ruling finding that NSO had unlawfully exploited a bug in its messaging service WhatsApp to plant spy software on its users' phones. On Tuesday, a jury in California ruled that NSO owed Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages - and $167.3 million in punitive damages, Meta said. ""Today's verdict in WhatsApp's case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,"" Meta said in a statement. In its statement, NSO said it would ""carefully examine the verdict's details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal."" NSO, an Israeli firm that first drew global attention in 2016, has become ""a poster child for the surveillance industry and their abuses and impunity,"" said Natalia Krapiva, a senior lawyer with the human rights group Access Now. NSO has long argued that its software is used to track terrorists and pedophiles, but the firm has been implicated in abusive surveillance in countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and El Salvador. WhatsApp's lawsuit - which was filed in 2019 and at one point made its way to the Supreme Court - has been closely followed both by NSO's competitors in the surveillance technology space and by human rights advocates critical of the industry. Victims of state-backed hacking have struggled to hold suppliers of spy software accountable for what their customers do with their tools, while hacking firms have long worried that their products could draw legal sanctions. The WhatsApp verdict was a sign that both outcomes were possible, said Krapiva. ""This is something that will hopefully show spyware companies that there will be consequences if you are careless, if you are brazen, and if you act in such a way as NSO did in these cases,"" she said.Beyond sending a message to spyware merchants, the case also pulled back the curtain - ever so slightly - on the inner workings of NSO itself.The court heard about NSO's 140 person-strong research team, whose $50 million budget was in part devoted to exploiting security vulnerabilities in smartphones. An attorney for the company disclosed that its customers included Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico - rare on-the-record names from NSO's closely guarded client list.Much about the spyware company's targets and clients remains unknown, in part because the firm refused to hand over evidence. In her December ruling, District Judge Phyllis Hamilton accused NSO of having ""repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery and failed to obey court orders regarding such discovery.""

Goldman Sachs Still Sees 45% Recession Odds. These Stocks Can Hold Up. — Barrons.com,1746555240000,"By Paul R. La MonicaWhile the Trump administration is showing a willingness to do trade deals, some economists aren't convinced that the worst is over for the U.S. economy. Investors will need to prepare for the possibility of a more severe deterioration in consumer and business spending.Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs still puts the chance of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months at 45%. On Tuesday, he cited concerns about a trade war with China as well as ""a meaningful risk that some of the paused 'reciprocal' tariffs will take effect after all.""Economists at JPMorgan are even more bearish: They said Monday they are maintaining their call of 60% odds of a recession in the second half of this year.""This is not the beginning of the end of the trade war, but only the end of the beginning,"" the JPMorgan economists wrote.So how should investors navigate this landscape? Investors are already worried about the impact of a trade war on consumer goods — both for discretionary items and retailers as well as staples.Clorox, for example, said in its latest earnings report Monday that it was lowering its outlook ""to reflect recent changes in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment...as well as the impact of tariffs."" The stock tumbled 2% Tuesday on the news.But consumer staples broadly are still holding up a lot better than the rest of the market. Clorox may be the exception rather than the rule. Coca-Cola is the top stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2025, while Philip Morris is one of the best performers in the S&P 500. Retailers Costco, Walmart and Kroger, which are classified as staples stocks, have enjoyed gains this year too.Others are also highlighting the virtues of investing in more defensive stocks. The recent winning streak for the broader market may have been a head fake.""The U.S. stock market is currently not pricing in a recession or even a meaningful slowdown. Investors appear to be expecting the 90-day tariff pause to become an off ramp for the Trump administration, allowing it time to slowly soften its aggressive trade policy without appearing to backtrack,"" said Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO and founding partner of asset management firm Bowersock Capital Partners, in an email.""The unappreciated risk is that the vacillations and lack of clarity on tariffs has already damaged the economy enough to cause a slowdown,"" she added.But Hill says there are still pockets of the market that look attractive. The technology sector remains a favorite, she said, noting that such stocks ""will continue to benefit from the AI-driven productivity boost to economic growth."" Hill recommends chip equipment company Lam Research.Others noted that recent earnings from some of the members of the Magnificent Seven are a good sign for tech, too.Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist with Ameriprise, said in a report that strong results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms are ""somewhat putting to rest the idea that spending on artificial intelligence is slowing down amid the tariff uncertainty.""Some financial stocks also might be worth owning — even if there is a recession. Hill said big banks should get a lift from the expectation that Trump will eventually push for deregulation of the industry and from hopes the Fed could start lowering interest rates again at some point this summer. Investors are betting on banks, too. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF, which has big holdings in JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, is up 2% this year.The ""digital payment adoption is likely to spur growth in parts of the financial sector,"" Hill adds. That would be good news for credit card lender/regional bank Capital One.Finally, healthcare is a defensive sector that has held up well — despite concerns about potential regulatory changes from the Trump administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and worries about insurer UnitedHealth's weak guidance.Other healthcare stocks — such as UnitedHealth rivals CVS (which owns insurer Aetna), Cigna and Elevance Health, drug companies Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, and equipment makers Intuitive Surgical and Medtronic — are all in positive territory this year. So is biotech Amgen, which Hill recommends.It's worth noting that most of the stocks in these flight-to-safety sectors also pay solid dividends. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF is flat this year. And with bond yields slipping as recession fears rise, owning stocks that provide steady income can help investors sleep better at night.Write to Paul R.

Meta's Key AI Model Hit by Delay. What It Means for the Stock. — Barrons.com,1747386840000,"By Callum KeownMeta Platforms stock held steady early Friday after falling late in the previous session following a report that the Facebook parent is delaying the rollout of its new artificial intelligence model.The release of Meta's Behemoth large-language model was initially internally slated for April before it was pushed to June, but now the target has been delayed to the fall or later, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.The shares fell 2.4% Thursday and were flat in premarket trading Friday. The stock looks to be stabilizing following the losses, suggesting the delay may not have a huge impact on the price. Meta remains 10% higher in 2025 through Thursday's close — the best performer in the Magnificent Seven group.Engineers are struggling to improve the model's capabilities, leading to questions from staff over whether Behemoth has enough improvements over previous versions to justify a public release, the report added.The tech giant, like its peers, is spending billions of dollars on developing AI offerings. Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion at the end of last month, up from between $60 billion and $65 billion.Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.Separately, Meta asked a federal judge to dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's case alleging it run an illegal social media monopoly Thursday, Reuters reported. The antitrust trial, relating to Meta's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, began last month.Write to Callum Keown at callum.keown@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

This zero-day options craze could finally be coming to popular stocks like Nvidia and Tesla. Here's what to know.,1746543180000,"By Joseph AdinolfiNasdaq has asked the SEC for permission to list options tied to a handful of popular stocks that would expire on Mondays and WednesdaysAn earlier version of this story incorrectly named Scott Bauer's firm.A surge in trading of so-called ""zero days to expiry"" - or ""0DTE"" - options has contributed to an options-market boom over the past few years, drawing in both sophisticated investors and amateur speculators.During the trading week, investors have been limited to trading 0DTE contracts tied to stock-market indexes like the S&P 500 and a handful of popular ETFs, including the Invesco QQQ Trust.But after a long wait, they could soon be coming for popular stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)In a filing published late last week, Nasdaq Inc. officially asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to expand offerings of option contracts tied to a handful of individual stocks. If the SEC signs off, the exchange would be allowed to list options tied to a select group of stocks that expire on Mondays and Wednesdays, giving traders two more opportunities per week to trade option contracts on the edge of expiration.""It's probably been a long time in the making,"" Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy and a former floor trader on a major options exchange, told MarketWatch.Currently, options tied to individual common stocks only expire on Fridays, while contracts tied to some stock-market indexes and highly liquid ETFs have more frequent expirations.Although a Nasdaq executive declined to comment on the exchange's plans, traders and industry experts who spoke with MarketWatch said that, if all goes well, contracts expiring on Tuesdays and Thursdays could soon follow.""They're not pure 0DTEs in the sense that they're not listed every day, but it's getting pretty close,"" Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics, told MarketWatch.See: 2024 was another record-breaking year for options trading. What's on tap for the industry in 2025.What is a '0DTE' option?Any option due to expire at the end of a session is considered a 0DTE contract. Technically, every option becomes a 0DTE on the last day of its life.Traders who spoke with MarketWatch have said the appeal of these contracts lies in the small chance of an outsize gain. If the market pushes them into the money before they expire, it could lead to a large windfall for a trader who had bought them minutes or hours earlier.Back in 2022, popular exchange operators like Cboe Global Markets expanded offerings tied to the S&P 500 and a few popular ETFs to allow traders to trade 0DTE contracts every day of the trading week. The change helped accelerate a boom in options trading that had begun shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic.The average daily trading volume in these extremely short-dated contracts has been climbing steadily since. 0DTE volumes in S&P 500 index options hit a record during the first quarter of 2025, according to Cboe data.A Cboe analyst estimated that roughly 50% to 60% of the average daily activity in S&P 500 0DTE contracts involves amateur individual investors, although the exact share is difficult to determine precisely.Their rise has coincided with a surge in activity across the broader U.S. equity-options market. According to the Options Clearing Corporation, the industry's main clearinghouse, more than 12 billion contracts changed hands in 2024, setting a record for the fifth year in a row.It appears another record could follow in 2025, with the industry already on track to top 14 billion contracts traded, according to Henry Schwartz, vice president of market intelligence at Cboe.'We're working closely with everybody'The SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny Nasdaq's request once the filing is published in the Federal Register, which had not yet happened as of Tuesday morning. A representative for the SEC didn't return a request for comment from MarketWatch.Once approved, these options could start trading within days.Nasdaq's decision to request the change was the culmination of a lengthy process by exchanges, brokerage platforms, market makers and other options-industry players. The goal was to figure out the best way to introduce more short-dated contracts tied to shares of individual stocks in a manner that would minimize risks for the industry and its customers.Ultimately, the exchange decided that Monday and Wednesday contracts wouldn't be listed on any day when the underlying company is due to report quarterly earnings. This should help to limit the chances that volatile swings in stocks after the closing bell could complicate trade settlements, a Nasdaq representative said.""We're working closely with everybody to make sure we're doing this in a safe and responsible way,"" said Greg Ferrari, a senior vice president at Nasdaq within the market platforms division.The changes proposed by Nasdaq would only allow Monday and Wednesday expirations for a handful of stocks and one additional ETF. As of January 2025, only contracts tied to Nvidia, Tesla, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) would be eligible for the Monday and Wednesday listings, along with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF XLF.'Lottery tickets'Options-market activity has been trending toward shorter-dated contracts for years, said OptionMetrics' DeSimone.At the same time, the advent of free-to-trade electronic brokerages has helped inspire a new generation of amateur individual investors to try their hand at options trading.Making it easier to trade 0DTE tied to individual stocks could accelerate both of these trends, DeSimone said. While institutional players still dominate index options, individual traders are more active in the single-stock space, DeSimone said.DeSimone cautioned that anybody interested in trading these products should keep their risk profile in mind. Some in the industry have likened 0DTE contracts to ""lottery tickets"" that offer a small chance of a large payout, and a high likelihood that the contract will expire worthless.JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, parent of brokerage tastytrade, pushed back against this characterization, calling it hyperbolic. He said many investors trade 0DTE options as part of spread strategies involving more than one contract, allowing them to more precisely manage their risk. Nasdaq and others have said that 0DTEs can help large traders more tactically manage their risk.""I think people are excited for the opportunity, but again I think we'll need to do some more education regarding exercise and assignment risk,"" Kinahan said. ""We have to continue to educate as to what the risks of these are, especially after the close.""-Joseph AdinolfiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Bull of the Day: AppLovin Corporation (APP),1747382400000,"AppLovin Corporation APP   is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level. AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more. Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth. The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26. Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices. APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s NVDA 360% and Meta’s META 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:884240936094b:0-bull-of-the-day-applovin-corporation-app/
"Buy, Sell or Hold Innodata Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings",1746542580000,"Innodata INOD is scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 8.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $58.66 million, suggesting a 121.36% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at 20 cents per share, indicating an increase of 566.67% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Innodata has a positive earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 40.91%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 220.46%.Innodata Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseInnodata Inc. price-eps-surprise | Innodata Inc. QuoteEarnings Whispers for INODOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Innodata this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.INOD has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors to Note for INOD Ahead of Q1 ResultsInnodata approaches its first-quarter 2025 earnings report following an exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, where the company posted record-breaking 127% year-over-year growth and substantial profit improvements. While the strong momentum is expected to continue, several factors suggest investors should hold their positions or await a better entry point before adding to their stakes.The recent beta launch of Innodata's Generative AI Test & Evaluation Platform, powered by NVIDIA technology, represents a strategic expansion of the company's AI services portfolio. This platform, showcased at NVIDIA GTC 2025 in March, aims to address enterprise needs for AI risk mitigation and performance optimization. While this initiative aligns with Innodata's growth strategy in the AI services market, the platform's full commercial release isn't expected until the second quarter of 2025, limiting its revenue impact on first-quarter results.Innodata's strong relationship with its largest customer, which contributed significantly to the fourth quarter of 2024 results, is likely to have continued to drive growth in first-quarter 2025. The company previously announced additional programs valued at approximately $24 million in annualized run rate revenues with this customer. However, this concentration risk remains a concern, despite efforts to diversify the client base by expanding relationships with seven other Big Tech customers.The company's forecast of 40% or more revenue growth for full-year 2025 suggests continued strong performance, but the projected reinvestment of cash from operations back into the business might have temporarily impacted profit margins in the first quarter. These investments, while positioning Innodata for sustained multi-year growth, could create near-term volatility in financial metrics.Industry tailwinds from AI-driven capital expenditure among major tech companies are likely to have benefited Innodata in the first quarter of 2025, as the company continues to position itself as a key player in the growing AI services market. The company's strong balance sheet, with $46.9 million in cash at the end of 2024, provides flexibility to execute its expansion strategy while weathering any short-term fluctuations.Investors should monitor how effectively Innodata is diversifying its customer base and commercializing new offerings like the AI Test & Evaluation Platform. While the long-term growth prospects remain promising, potential volatility associated with ongoing investments and customer concentration suggests a cautious approach ahead of the first-quarter 2025 earnings report.INOD Price Performance & Stock ValuationINOD shares have skyrocketed 467.5% in the trailing 12-month period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 5.1% and the industry’s return of 7.5%.1-Year PerformanceWhile INOD stock trades at a premium with a six-month forward 12-month P/S ratio of 4.62x compared with the Zacks Computer – Services industry average of 1.75x, this premium valuation appears justified given the company's strong growth prospects and strategic positioning in the generative AI (GenAI) space.INOD’s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched ValuationMorgan Stanley has projected combined capital expenditures of $300 billion in 2025 and $337 billion in 2026 for Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft on GenAI and large language model-enabled advancements. By focusing on Big Tech’s increasing investments in GenAI, Innodata has positioned itself as a key partner for data engineering, particularly in creating supervised fine-tuning data for training advanced AI models.Investment ThesisInnodata's investment case presents a mixed outlook ahead of first-quarter 2025 results. While the company delivered 127% growth in fourth-quarter 2024 and projects more than 40% revenue growth for 2025, investors should exercise caution at current valuation levels. The beta launch of its NVIDIA-powered AI Test & Evaluation Platform represents future potential, but full commercialization won't occur until the second quarter. Customer concentration risk persists despite diversification efforts with other Big Tech clients. Planned reinvestment in operations may temporarily pressure margins, despite the strong $46.9 million cash position.ConclusionInnodata presents a cautious investment case with recent record growth juxtaposed against premium valuation and increasing competition in AI services. The unrealized first-quarter impact of its NVIDIA-powered platform, ongoing customer concentration risks, and planned reinvestments suggest potential near-term volatility. Investors should consider holding existing positions or awaiting a more attractive entry point following the first-quarter results.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:3ac46fc6e094b:0-buy-sell-or-hold-innodata-stock-key-tips-ahead-of-q1-earnings/
Meta Battles an 'Epidemic of Scams' as Criminals Flood Instagram and Facebook — WSJ,1747357200000,"By Jeff Horwitz and Angel Au-YeungFor almost two years, Edgar Guzman has been getting calls from irate customers who responded to his ads on Instagram and Facebook. Or at least they thought they were his ads.Guzman's company, called ""Half-Off Wholesale,"" offers home-improvement supplies and garden equipment in bulk out of a suburban Atlanta warehouse. The ads offer steep discounts that are mouthwatering to bargain hunters: $29 for a pallet of power tools, and mixed boxes of returned Amazon.com merchandise with a starting bid of just $1, for example.But when people send their payments, the products never arrive. When they call Guzman to complain, he has to deliver the bad news: They've been swindled.""What sucks is we have to break it to people that they've been scammed — we don't even do online sales,"" he said, noting that customer complaints about the rip-offs generate bad online reviews for his real business. ""We keep reporting pages to Meta, but nothing ever happens.""Guzman's experience is not unusual.Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is increasingly a cornerstone of the internet fraud economy, according to regulators, banks and internal documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.The company accounted for nearly half of all reported scams on Zelle for JPMorgan Chase between the summers of 2023 and 2024, according to a person familiar with the service. The peer-to-peer payment platform is owned by several banking giants, including JPMorgan, the country's biggest bank, and Wells Fargo. Other banks that offer Zelle have experienced similarly high fraud claims originating on Meta, according to people familiar with the matter.British and Australian regulators have found similar levels of fraud originating on Meta's platforms. An internal analysis from 2022 described in company documents likewise found that 70% of newly active advertisers on the platform are promoting scams, illicit goods or ""low quality"" products.In Guzman's case, a search of Meta's ad library this spring showed that more than 4,400 different ads listing the address of his business have run on Meta's platforms over the last year. Guzman's actual business was responsible for 15 of them.Account information for the scam pages shows they are run out of China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and the Philippines, but they use stolen pictures of Half-Off's warehouse and list its address.With more than 3 billion daily users on Meta's platforms, fraud is hardly a new phenomenon for the company. But fed by the rise of cryptocurrencies, generative AI and vast overseas crime networks based out of Southeast Asia, the immensity of Meta's scam problem is growing and has been regularly flagged by employees over the past several years.Current and former employees say Meta is reluctant to add impediments for ad-buying clients who drove a 22% increase in its advertising business last year to over $160 billion. Even after users demonstrate a history of scamming, Meta balks at removing them.One late 2024 document reviewed by the Journal shows that the company will allow advertisers to accrue between eight and 32 automated ""strikes"" for financial fraud before it bans their accounts. In instances where Meta employees personally escalate the problem, the limit can drop to between four and 16 strikes.Adding to the problem is Marketplace, its online secondhand-market that in less than a decade since its launch has surpassed Craigslist to become the internet's most heavily used repository of free classified ads. Its peer-to-peer model has also made Marketplace a popular hunting ground for scammers.A Meta spokesman said that the company is working to address ""an epidemic of scams"" that has grown in scale and complexity in recent years, driven by cross-border criminal networks.""As this scam activity has become more persistent and sophisticated, so have our efforts,"" he said. He added that Meta is testing the use of facial-recognition technology, adding warnings to users on its platforms and building partnerships with banks and tech companies ""since this crime affects many industries and cuts across different parts of society.""Meta has also argued in U.S. federal court that it bears no legal responsibility to address the issue.""The alleged underenforcement of Meta's monitoring policies cannot give rise to liability,"" the company wrote last year in a motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging negligence in removing cryptocurrency impersonation scams, adding that it ""does not owe a duty to users"" to address fraud on its platforms.The spokesman said the company nonetheless makes efforts to do so.""We of course don't want scammy activity on our platform and nothing about this statement — a nuanced legal argument — should be read to suggest otherwise,"" he said.Fake giveawaysMeta chief Mark Zuckerberg's recent move to scale back fact checking and policing of hate speech and other problem content has infuriated some and pleased others. But his company's ongoing ineffectiveness at governing fraud on its platforms has drawn less scrutiny — even though it causes widespread and tangible problems for consumers and businesses.Meta's lax approach has helped fuel the professionalization of social-media fraud by international criminal networks in Southeast Asia, says Erin West, a recently retired Santa Clara County prosecutor who helped author a U.S. Institute for Peace report last year on such activity.The report estimated organized scamming operations — often called ""pig butchering"" groups — comprise hundreds of thousands of people, many trafficked after falling for fraudulent social-media employment ads. Kept in prisonlike compounds, the workers are forced to work under threat of ""extreme forms of torture and abuse.""West said the growth of this nightmarish industry stems directly from the inaction of Meta and, to a lesser extent, its social-media peers.""If there's anybody who could make a huge dent here, it's Meta,"" she said. ""But there's no hammer over their head.""Losses to scams on Meta can range into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but there's seemingly no target too small.Some of the frauds reflect substantial complexity and effort. In recent months, accounts featuring grandmotherly photos have been running Facebook and Instagram ads for a supposed giveaway of a McCormick & Co. spice rack and a selection of its products. Users are asked to provide only a nominal $9.99 shipping fee via a website featuring McCormick branding, a user survey and a game to win prizes.Marah Johnson of Orange County, Calif., has regularly encountered and reported scams on Facebook for years. But she fell for this one. After she entered her credit card information on the McCormick-branded website, she was billed for a series of fraudulent purchases totaling hundreds of dollars.""If their revenue is coming from fraud, what is their incentive to protect people?"" asked Johnson, a 58-year-old artist and jewelry-maker. ""It feels like Meta is helping the scammers out.""The scam is sufficiently widespread that McCormick Brands warned its 2 million followers on Facebook and Instagram of it on Jan. 31, eliciting hundreds of comments from users who said they'd been scammed.""I feel so stupid,"" wrote one.""I got hit for $70 I can't afford,"" responded another.""Why can't Facebook police these scammers?"" asked a third.A McCormick spokesperson declined to comment.Puppies for saleOne of the most common scams seen by banks involves the sale of pets, despite Meta's rules banning ""peer-to-peer sales or trade"" of live animals outside of narrow contexts.A recent search for ""puppies"" over several days yielded thousands of ads, most stating no affiliation with a known dog breeder or rescue organization as Meta's rules require.Other red flags abounded. Many of the results displayed common hallmarks of scams, including stolen photos of specific pets and ads from sellers supposedly ""near me"" who were actually operating out of Cameroon.JPMorgan has repeatedly raised concerns with Meta about its policing of scams, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person said the volume of scams attributable to Meta has shown some improvement in recent months.During that period both Meta and Zelle began issuing warnings to their respective users about scam risks arising from peer-to-peer payments.Documents reviewed by the Journal show that Meta has deprioritized scam enforcement in recent years, emphasizing the avoidance of erroneous ad takedowns over safety concerns. The company has also been cutting costs and shifting resources to other issues in the reshuffling.The company abandoned plans for advertiser verification requirements similar to what it mandates for political ads, people familiar with the matter say, on the grounds that it worried about losing revenue from marketers unwilling or unable to pass identity checks.Meta has periodically declared ""site events"" — company slang for internal emergencies of varying severity — for spikes in scams. But the company has generally treated scams as what documents describe as a ""low severity"" user experience issue rather than a significant threat to vulnerable people or vector for organized international crime.One 2022 document described ""a lack of investment"" in building automated tools to identify scams. The work's low priority within Meta was codified in an update that year of its content moderation processes that put more resources into addressing human trafficking and content promoting suicide and self-harm, and less on anti-scam measures.A mid-2022 analysis of the reprioritization found that it resulted in a 46% drop in likely scams reviewed within Facebook Groups.The Meta spokesman said that the documents seen by the Journal are old and that the company has been ramping up its investments in anti-scam work since the second half of 2022. He said it took down more than 2 million accounts linked to organized fraud operations last year. Of the advertiser accounts it shut down, he said, nearly 70% were caught within a week of their creation.Because of a safe harbor in U.S. telecommunications law known as section 230, platforms are generally shielded from liability for user-created content. Whether those protections apply to Meta's ads is now being tested by Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining billionaire and philanthropist who became frustrated in 2019 with Meta's failure to remove fraudulent investment advertisements using his image and AI-cloned voice.In a motion to dismiss the case last year, Meta argued that it is under no obligation to require investment advertisers to verify their identities or demonstrate that they're licensed to sell such products.""Because Meta has no duty to protect users from third-party content on its platform, Plaintiff cannot state a negligence claim,"" the company said.Write to Jeff Horwitz at jeff.horwitz@wsj.com and Angel Au-Yeung at angel.au-yeung@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515014756:0/

Why Big Tech ETFs Still Remain Great Bets,1746535320000,"The start of the year 2025 was not kind to Big Tech stocks due to trade tensions, fears of rising inflation, and the rise of low-cost artificial intelligence companies in China. The tech-heavy ETF Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ is off 4.8% so far this year and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK has lost 7.1% in the year-to-date frame (as of May 5, 2025).However, this might be a temporary blip, and investors should be unfazed by the year-to-date decline in Big Tech stocks. The tech segment is proving its resilience once again, as evident from the 17.4% past-month uptick in XLK and 14.7% rise in QQQ.Below, we highlight a few factors that say Big Tech stocks and ETFs are still safe and great investments.Earnings Blow Past ExpectationsThis earnings season has underscored how the largest technology companies continue to outperform the broader S&P 500, even amid concerns over tariffs. Excluding NVIDIA NVDA, which reports later this month, the other six members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" beat Wall Street estimates by an average of 16%, according to Bank of America, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. That’s a sharp contrast to the 4% earnings beat recorded by the rest of the S&P 500 so far.Forget Pullback: AI Remains the Key FocusWhile the tech sector is still recovering from a pullback in February—triggered in part by market reactions to low-cost AI DeepSeek—this hasn't derailed investor optimism. Instead, the pullback caused some valuation corrections and set the stage for renewed focus on U.S. tech leadership and AI investment.According to Bank of America, the current earnings cycle confirms that hyperscalers are continuing with their AI investment strategies, even if capex growth is moderating slightly.Capex Surge Signals Long-Term ConfidenceTech giants have not held back on capital expenditures, despite the rise of low-cost AI challengers. Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT reiterated their investment plans during earnings calls. Meta META even raised its full-year capex forecast, while Amazon AMZN reported continued triple-digit growth in its AI-related revenues.Bank of America reports that capital spending by the hyperscaler group grew by 62% year-over-year this quarter, with a projected 35% increase for the full year, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Big Capex = Big Conviction? Despite trade tensions, Big Tech’s aggressive forward plans stand out. In an environment where many are hesitant, these companies are forging ahead. This shows their conviction in their investment plans.Any Wall of Worry?Amazon — the cloud computing leader — reported slowing growth, attributing it to capacity limitations in its data center infrastructure. However, Amazon’s revenue outlook met consensus estimates, highlighting the strength and adaptability of its business model amid a tough operating landscape owing to tariffs.For some, like Alphabet’s Google search franchise, is seen as under threat in the emerging AI world, and the company remains determined to defend its territory. Of the Mag 7 players, Apple faced the most pronounced tariff impact, which has been well known due to its significant exposure to China. If the government manages to strike a trade deal with China or Apple secures some exemptions from government, the outlook for Apple should improve.ETFs in Focus Given this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We have highlighted some ETFs with the largest exposure to Mag 7.Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS – Down 12.2% YTD; Up 14.6% Past MonthMicroSectors FANG+ ETN FNGS – Down 2.7% YTD; Up 21.5% Past MonthVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK – Down 5.8% YTD; Up 16.2% Past MonthInvesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG – Down 6.6% YTD; Up 12% Past MonthThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:6a02ae310094b:0-why-big-tech-etfs-still-remain-great-bets/

An Idaho Utility With Growth Potential — Barron's,1748050200000,"Idacorp offers a play on cheap power production and artificial intelligence. Its stock looks like a buy. By Al RootWhen you play Monopoly, you avoid the utilities — they're boring and don't make much money. In the game of life, however, picking up shares of Idacorp, Idaho's regulated electric utility, looks like a winning play.Boise-based Idacorp's principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power, a 109-year-old utility serving some 650,000 retail customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. It generates about two-thirds of the power it delivers to customers, while purchasing the rest. About 20% of the power it generates comes from coal, which the company plans to replace with gas by 2030, while more than half comes from relatively low-cost hydropower, which helps keep costs low for Idahoans. The average price paid by Idacorp customers is less than 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, almost one-third of what Northeasterners pay for their electricity.Northeastern envy isn't a good reason to buy the stock, though. Growth is. The company sees 8.3% demand growth over the next five years, up from about 1% over the past five. That growth is underpinned by low prices, population inflow, and power-hungry data centers producing cheap electricity for artificial-intelligence computers. Meta Platforms, for instance, is building a data center in Kuna, Idaho, about 20 miles outside of Boise.""It's just about the fastest-growing utility in the country right now,"" says John Bartlett, president and portfolio manager of Reaves Asset Management. The growth rate, expected to be about twice the industry norm, makes the shares look cheap. They trade for about 17 times estimated 2027 earnings and yield 3% — in line with utility averages.The stock hasn't been outperforming, however. Shares are up 6% year to date, about one percentage point behind the Vanguard Utilities exchange-traded fund, which yields a little less than 3%. It didn't help that Idacorp stock traded down about 2% following its May 1 first-quarter earnings report, when the company announced earnings per share of $1.10, seven cents ahead of Wall Street estimates, while reiterating full-year EPS guidance of $5.65 to $5.85. Investors might have been looking for a more substantive update on power rates and capital spending, writes Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell, adding that he thought the quarter was fine.""We view the Idacorp story as one of the strongest in the sub--$10 billion market-cap group,"" says Crowdell, who rates shares Outperform and has a $124 price target for the stock, up about 7% from recent levels.That might not seem like much upside, but it is partly a function of the sector. The median upside for an electric utility stock in the Russell 3000 is about 8% from current levels. Regulated utilities are supposed to be steady Eddies. Few expect them to double over a short period, but returns can be solid. With typical earnings growth for the sector of 6% to 7% and dividend yields of 3%, a 10% total annual return is possible, says Bartlett. Unregulated utilities such as Constellation Energy take more risks on pricing and capacity expansion, hoping to boost asset returns and earnings growth.Idacorp, however, is unusual as a regulated utility with unregulated-like growth. Wall Street projects that earnings will grow close to 8% a year for the coming three years, but Bartlett sees growth better than that as generation capacity expands. It could look more like Constellation's 14% average annual earnings growth. Idacorp stock, however, doesn't trade like Constellation, which fetches 26 times estimated 2026 earnings. Crowdell sees the opportunity for shares to ""rerate"" to a higher price/earnings ratio, but that isn't reflected in his target price.Utilities aren't risk free. Because they're often bought for income, rising long-term bond yields tend to weigh on the sector's valuation multiples, something that's out of Idacorp's control. The group can also suffer ""rate lag"" — when regulators drag out the price increases that enable growth and expansion of capacity. That's something Idacorp can influence. ""Our efforts to reduce regulatory lag [and] provide more timely cost recovery are certainly under way,"" said Tim Tatum, Idacorp's vice president of regulatory affairs, on his company's first-quarter conference call. ""We're hopeful for success in that area."" Idacorp is planning to file a ""rate case"" in late May or early June. A favorable outcome with regulators could give shares a boost later this year.It's necessary, too, as Idacorp invests for growth. Siebert Williams Shank analyst Christopher Ellinghaus expects the company to spend $5.6 billion on new plants and equipment over the coming five years, up from $2.8 billion spent from 2020 to 2024. Higher spending could pressure the balance sheet. The company's net debt is 4.3 times as large as its estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, higher than investors might be used to, but about average for an electric utility.The company is taking steps to make sure its balance sheet doesn't become a problem. Earlier this month, Idacorp raised $575 million in equity capital by selling 5.2 million shares. The sale solidifies the equity financing needed through 2026, says Ellinghaus, who has equity dilution factored into his earnings model. He rates shares Buy and has a $129 price target for the stock, up 11% from recent levels. ""The company has a slew of electricity resource and transmission investments in the hopper,"" he adds, designed to serve ""some of the fastest prospective electricity customer, sales...and rate base growth in the industry.""The risks look manageable, the growth substantial, and the valuation reasonable, making Idacorp stock an undiscovered gem in the Gem State.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250522000714:0/
"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms and Microsoft",1746535320000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 6, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.The Standout Magnificent 7 Stock: Microsoft's Quiet DominanceOver the past two weeks, most of the Magnificent 7 have reported earnings, and the results were broadly positive, reinforcing the strength and scale of these market leaders. Last week brought reports from Amazon , Apple , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , while the prior week featured Alphabet and Tesla .Among them, one company quietly stood above the rest: Microsoft.Microsoft's earnings results aren't the only thing prompting me to highlight the stock either—MSFT also boasts the highest Zacks Rank of the Mag 7 group, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been the best performing stock over the last one month, three months and year-to-date of the group.Microsoft Cloud Growth Leads Amazon and AlphabetMicrosoft's cloud business was the clear standout this quarter. Azure revenue grew 33% year-over-year , which was the fastest among the three major cloud providers, with AI services alone contributing 12 percentage points to that growth. The broader Intelligent Cloud segment reported $26.8 billion in revenue, up 21% from the prior year, with operating income reaching $11.1 billion.By comparison, Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted revenue of $29.3 billion, maintaining its lead in scale but growing just 17% , it marked the slowest pace of growth in five quarters. While AWS remains highly profitable, with a record 39.5% operating margin, the slowdown raises questions about whether it's ceding growth momentum to competitors.Google Cloud also delivered strong results, with revenue up 28% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Operating income came in at $2.2 billion, a significant improvement from $900 million a year ago, showing continued progress toward profitability.Taken together, these results highlight Microsoft's continued leadership in enterprise cloud and its growing advantage in AI infrastructure — both key drivers of long-term value. Azure's faster growth rate not only reinforces Microsoft's competitive edge, but also reflects its broader strategic positioning in what remains one of the most critical areas of tech spending.MSFT Stock has Less Tariff Risks Than AAPL, META and AMZNAs US–China trade tensions rise, tariff exposure has become a key risk factor for large-cap tech investors. Among the Magnificent 7, Microsoft is uniquely positioned, not only due to its strong fundamentals, but also because of its relatively low exposure to China and tariff-related disruptions.Apple stands out as one of the most vulnerable. The company's reliance on Chinese manufacturing for iPhones, iPads, and other hardware makes it especially sensitive to rising import costs and potential supply chain snarls. A significant portion of Apple's revenue also comes from Chinese consumers—a market that could easily be affected by retaliatory measures.Amazon faces its own set of challenges. While its core North American business remains robust, the company's global retail supply chain depends heavily on low-cost manufacturing hubs in China. Tariffs on goods shipped to the US from China could squeeze margins or complicate logistics for its sellers.Meta Platforms is less directly exposed to supply chains but faces its own geopolitical and macro risks. The company has long been restricted in China, but it still relies on global ad spending from brands with supply chains and customer bases in the region. In a deteriorating US–China trade environment, global advertising spend could weaken, affecting Meta's growth.Microsoft, by contrast, benefits from a business model centered around software, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise services, which are less vulnerable to tariffs or localized trade friction. Its supply chain exposure to China is limited, and its revenue is globally diversified, with much of its growth coming from the US, Europe, and emerging AI-driven demand.Magnificent 7 Valuations Appear FairMicrosoft currently holds the highest earnings multiple among the Magnificent 7, but that premium may be well-earned. While MSFT trades above its peers, it remains in line with its five-year median earnings multiple and so do Apple and Meta, which suggests that valuations are fair from a historical perspective.The rest of the group is trading well below their five-year averages, a welcome development for valuation-conscious investors after the sharp run-ups in recent years. Importantly, these valuations come alongside healthy earnings growth forecasts, which range from 12.8% annually for Apple to as high as 24.7% for Nvidia. Microsoft is expected to grow its earnings 14.6% annually over the next three to five years.With Microsoft's strong competitive positioning, durable growth, and relatively low macro risk, its premium multiple appears justified, however, most of the Magnificent 7 stocks appear attractively valued.Should Investors Buy Shares in MSFT?Microsoft continues to stand out as a well-rounded member of the Magnificent 7—delivering top-tier cloud growth, strong earnings momentum, and relatively low exposure to macro and geopolitical risks. Its premium valuation appears justified given its leadership in AI and enterprise business, and its stock performance reflects growing investor confidence.While many of its peers also look attractively valued after recent pullbacks, Microsoft remains a compelling core holding for long-term investors seeking stability, growth, and resilience in an uncertain market.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Markets Mostly Up on Mid-East Wheeling, Dealing",1747346880000,"Thursday, May 15, 2025Markets closed mostly up this session on moderately good news rippling through economic concerns throughout the day. With President Trump continuing his tour through the Middle East, we’re seeing a plethora of deals being made there with American corporations:Boeing BA will send more than 200 jets to Qatar Airways, $142 billion in military equipment investments will go to Saudi Arabia, billions more in Saudi infrastructure with supplies from AMD AMD, Cisco CSCO and others, and 18K AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA will be sent to a company chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS.The Dow gained +271 points today, +0.65%, while the S&P 500 rose +0.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.52%. The Nasdaq, which has risen +13% over the past month, faltered this afternoon following news reports of an SEC investigation into Coinbase COIN and a cybersecurity hack, sending the stock down -7% today. Also, reports of Meta META delaying its AI rollout has sent those shares down -2.3% today.Earnings Reports After the Close: AMAT, TTWO, CAVASemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT posted mixed results in its fiscal Q2 report after today’s closing bell, beating the Zacks consensus on earnings by 8 cents to $2.39 per share on revenues which were a smidge light of expectations, to $7.1 billion in the quarter. Next-quarter earnings guidance is up 3 dents to $2.35 per share. The company said it sees “no change in customer demand” and that it is “well equipped to navigate supply chains” based on tariff policy. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Take Two Software TTWO, the maker of Grand Theft Auto and dozens of other video-game titles, posted a huge one-time impairment charge and missed on its fiscal Q4 bottom line by a wide margin. Revenues, however, came in slight better than expected to $1.58 billion, but lowered full-year revenue guidance. Shares are down -2.6% in after-hours trading.Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain Cava Group CAVA outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with 22 cents per share — based on a one-time income tax benefit — surpassing the Zacks consensus of 14 cents per share. Revenues of $332 million outpaced the $330.6 million expected. Same-store sales grew +11% year over year, with +7% in traffic. Yet shares are giving back their +3.5% gains over the past week of trading completely.What to Expect from the Stock Market FridayTomorrow, we cool off on the calendar Q1 earnings front — although we still have a couple weeks remaining of “earnings season,” which won’t unofficially end until NVIDIA reports in a couple weeks. But we we see Import and Export Prices ahead of the open, as well as Housing Starts and Building Permits — all for April. Earlier today, we saw a sagging Homebuilders Confidence survey for May, as high mortgage and home prices are remaining out of range for many prospective buyers, with many others feeling prices may be due to come down over the coming months. We’ll also see a new preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey for May on Friday, as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/
Inside Last Week's Wall Street Rally & Best-Performing ETF Areas ,1746524940000,"The S&P 500 just marked its longest winning streak since November 2004, closing higher for multiple sessions. U.S. stocks surged on Friday, marking a significant comeback for major indexes, led by a strong jobs report and a possible breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations.The S&P 500 jumped nearly 1.5%, surpassing its April 2 closing level—referred to by President Trump as “Liberation Day,” when sweeping tariffs were announced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, logging its ninth consecutive winning day. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite also climbed roughly 1.5%.Weekly Market Performance: All Major Indexes ClimbFriday’s rally capped off a strong week for U.S. equities. The Dow rose 3%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a 3.4% gain. Optimism over Big Tech earnings and signs of progress in trade discussions were key drivers of the weekly surge.Job Market Beats ExpectationsMarkets were buoyed by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, exceeding economists’ expectations of 138,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, signaling continued strength in the labor market despite recent volatility tied to tariff fears.Hopes Rise for U.S.-China Trade TalksInvestor optimism was further fueled by news from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry indicated openness to talks, saying the ""door is open"" for negotiations if the U.S. agrees to scale back reciprocal tariffs. This development suggested a possible thaw in trade tensions that had rattled markets since April.Microsoft and Meta Lead the 'Magnificent 7'Among the tech heavyweights, Microsoft MSFT and Meta META stood out last week. Microsoft soared over 11% last week, marking its best performance since March 2023. Meta also posted its strongest week since February 2024. In contrast, Apple lagged behind, falling over 2% for the week following its quarterly results.Apple & Amazon React to Tariff PressuresDespite strong earnings, some tech giants felt the pressure of trade uncertainty. Apple AAPL reported a $900 million tariff headwind this quarter and cut its share buyback program by $10 billion, causing its stock to dip. Amazon AMZN posted solid earnings but offered cautious guidance, citing tariffs and trade policy as key concerns.

Production has fallen to a two-month low.Taiwan – iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF EWT – Up 9.7%The outlook for Asian markets is positive. Following gains in U.S. and European markets, Asian markets also gained.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Best-Performing Leveraged ETFs of Last Week,1746524520000,"The S&P 500 just marked its longest winning streak since November 2004, closing higher for multiple sessions. U.S. stocks surged on Friday, marking a significant comeback for major indexes, led by a strong jobs report and a possible breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations.The S&P 500 jumped nearly 1.5%, surpassing its April 2 closing level—referred to by President Trump as “Liberation Day,” when sweeping tariffs were announced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, logging its ninth consecutive winning day. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite also climbed roughly 1.5%.Weekly Market Performance: All Major Indexes ClimbFriday’s rally capped off a strong week for U.S. equities. The Dow rose 3%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a 3.4% gain. Optimism over Big Tech earnings and signs of progress in trade discussions were key drivers of the weekly surge.Job Market Beats ExpectationsMarkets were buoyed by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, exceeding economists’ expectations of 138,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, signaling continued strength in the labor market despite recent volatility tied to tariff fears.Hopes Rise for U.S.-China Trade TalksInvestor optimism was further fueled by news from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry indicated openness to talks, saying the ""door is open"" for negotiations if the U.S. agrees to scale back reciprocal tariffs. This development suggested a possible thaw in trade tensions that had rattled markets since April.Microsoft and Meta Lead the 'Magnificent 7'Among the tech heavyweights, Microsoft MSFT and Meta META stood out last week. Microsoft soared over 11% last week, marking its best performance since March 2023. Meta also posted its strongest week since February 2024. In contrast, Apple AAPL lagged behind, falling over 2% for the week following its quarterly results.Apple & Amazon React to Tariff PressuresDespite strong earnings, some tech giants felt the pressure of trade uncertainty. Apple reported a $900 million tariff headwind this quarter and cut its share buyback program by $10 billion, causing its stock to dip. Amazon AMZN posted solid earnings but offered cautious guidance, citing tariffs and trade policy as key concerns. Its shares ended the day little changed.Best Leveraged ETFs of Last Week Against this backdrop, below we highlight the top-performing leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) areas of the last week.Defiance Daily Target 2X Long HIMS ETF HIMZ – Up 74.1% Last WeekHims & Hers has consistently witnessed strong market acceptance of its range of curated health and wellness products and services over the past few months. Hims & Hers partnered with Novo Nordisk NVO to expand access to its popular obesity care.

"Buy, Sell, or Hold These Mag 7 Stocks After Earnings: AAPL, AMZN ",1746476280000,"Markets haven’t kept the momentum investors were hoping for after receiving much-anticipated quarterly results from Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL last Thursday.While both were able to exceed top and bottom-line expectations, their guidance was somewhat underwhelming compared to the more reassuring outlook given by other Mag-7 tech giants like Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Amazon’s Q1 Review Following previous news reports that Amazon had planned to highlight how higher tariffs are raising prices on its platform, the e-commerce giant stated it’s working to keep prices low amid an uncertain moment for consumers. Amazon’s Q1 sales rose 10% year over year to $155.66 billion and eclipsed estimates of $154.56 billion. Notably, Amazon’s cloud computing division, AWS, contributed to 19% of its Q1 sales and increased 17% YoY to $29.3 billion. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS of $1.59 comfortably exceeded expectations of $1.35 by 17% and spiked 40% from $1.13 per share a year ago. Amazon has exceeded sales estimates in three of its last four quarterly reports and has beaten earnings expectations for 10 consecutive quarters.Apple’s Q2 Review Reporting results for its fiscal second quarter, Apple’s Q2 sales were up 5% to $95.35 billion and topped estimates of $94.26 billion. Apple also highlighted that its services segment achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.7 billion, which increased 12% from the comparative quarter and was driven by strong performance across Apple Music, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other subscription-based services.Apple’s Q2 EPS of $1.65 was up 8% from $1.53 in the prior period and beat estimates of $1.61 per share by 2%. Furthermore, Apple has exceeded its top and bottom-line expectations for nine consecutive quarters. Amazon & Apple’s Guidance Amazon expects Q2 sales at $159-$164 billion with the current Zacks Consensus at $161.62 billion or 9% growth (Current Qtr below). Still, Amazon stated the external environment remains complex, with its Q2 operating income guidance of $13-$17.5 billion coming short of many analyst expectations of $17.8 billion. As for Apple, the company expects its Q3 sales to grow by low to mid-single digits, with the Zacks Consensus at $89.12 billion or 4% growth. Weighing on investor sentiment was that Apple expects $900 million in tariff-related costs on a 16% tax rate, although it projects its Q3 gross margins between 45.5%-46.5%.Apple expects Q3 operating expenses between $15.3-$15.4 billion. It’s noteworthy that Apple does plan to source 19 billion chips from a dozen states this year, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona, which should help to relieve tax-related pressures from a heavy reliance on international manufacturing in China, Taiwan, and India. What the Zacks Rank Suggests While it may be tempting to buy the 14% and 20% year-to-date drop in Amazon and Apple’s stock, respectively, the Zacks Rank suggests there could still be better buying opportunities ahead. To that point, their EPS growth is still enticing, but fiscal 2025 and FY26 earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline for Amazon and Apple over the last 30 days.That said, at their current levels, Amazon and Apple stock should offer long-term value to shareholders as they currently land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, a further decline in EPS estimates could lead to a sell rating, while a significant uptick could lead to a buy rating, but may not be plausible at the moment, given their somewhat underwhelming guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4a86ef008094b:0-buy-sell-or-hold-these-mag-7-stocks-after-earnings-aapl-amzn/
Meta Shares Fall After Reported Delay in Rollout of AI Model,1747339740000,"By Katherine HamiltonMeta shares fell after The Wall Street Journal reported the company would delay the launch of its new artificial-intelligence model.The stock dropped to as low as $635.58, or 3.6% below the previous close, after the report before paring the loss to $644.33 in late Thursday trading. Shares are still up about 10% this year.Meta's planned large-language model was originally set to be released in April, but was pushed to June. Now, the rollout has been delayed to fall or later, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.The slower rollout is sparking internal concerns about how much the technology company is spending on AI initiatives.

The Standout Magnificent 7 Stock: Microsoft's Quiet Dominance,1746468000000,"Over the past two weeks, most of the Magnificent 7 have reported earnings, and the results were broadly positive, reinforcing the strength and scale of these market leaders. Last week brought reports from Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), while the prior week featured Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA).Among them, one company quietly stood above the rest: Microsoft.Microsoft’s earnings results aren’t the only thing prompting me to highlight the stock either—MSFT also boasts the highest Zacks Rank of the Mag 7 group, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has been the best performing stock over the last one month, three months and year-to-date of the group.Microsoft Cloud Growth Leads Amazon and AlphabetMicrosoft’s cloud business was the clear standout this quarter. Azure revenue grew 33% year-over-year , which was the fastest among the three major cloud providers, with AI services alone contributing 12 percentage points to that growth. The broader Intelligent Cloud segment reported $26.8 billion in revenue, up 21% from the prior year, with operating income reaching $11.1 billion.By comparison, Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted revenue of $29.3 billion, maintaining its lead in scale but growing just 17% , it marked the slowest pace of growth in five quarters. While AWS remains highly profitable, with a record 39.5% operating margin, the slowdown raises questions about whether it's ceding growth momentum to competitors.Google Cloud also delivered strong results, with revenue up 28% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Operating income came in at $2.2 billion, a significant improvement from $900 million a year ago, showing continued progress toward profitability.Taken together, these results highlight Microsoft’s continued leadership in enterprise cloud and its growing advantage in AI infrastructure — both key drivers of long-term value. Azure’s faster growth rate not only reinforces Microsoft’s competitive edge, but also reflects its broader strategic positioning in what remains one of the most critical areas of tech spending.MSFT Stock has Less Tariff Risks Than AAPL, META and AMZNAs US–China trade tensions rise, tariff exposure has become a key risk factor for large-cap tech investors. Among the Magnificent 7, Microsoft is uniquely positioned, not only due to its strong fundamentals, but also because of its relatively low exposure to China and tariff-related disruptions.Apple stands out as one of the most vulnerable. The company’s reliance on Chinese manufacturing for iPhones, iPads, and other hardware makes it especially sensitive to rising import costs and potential supply chain snarls. A significant portion of Apple’s revenue also comes from Chinese consumers—a market that could easily be affected by retaliatory measures.Amazon faces its own set of challenges. While its core North American business remains robust, the company’s global retail supply chain depends heavily on low-cost manufacturing hubs in China. Tariffs on goods shipped to the US from China could squeeze margins or complicate logistics for its sellers.Meta Platforms is less directly exposed to supply chains but faces its own geopolitical and macro risks. The company has long been restricted in China, but it still relies on global ad spending from brands with supply chains and customer bases in the region. In a deteriorating US–China trade environment, global advertising spend could weaken, affecting Meta’s growth.Microsoft, by contrast, benefits from a business model centered around software, cloud infrastructure, and enterprise services, which are less vulnerable to tariffs or localized trade friction. Its supply chain exposure to China is limited, and its revenue is globally diversified, with much of its growth coming from the US, Europe, and emerging AI-driven demand.Magnificent 7 Valuations Appear FairMicrosoft currently holds the highest earnings multiple among the Magnificent 7, but that premium may be well-earned. While MSFT trades above its peers, it remains in line with its five-year median earnings multiple and so do Apple and Meta, which suggests that valuations are fair from a historical perspective.The rest of the group is trading well below their five-year averages, a welcome development for valuation-conscious investors after the sharp run-ups in recent years. Importantly, these valuations come alongside healthy earnings growth forecasts, which range from 12.8% annually for Apple to as high as 24.7% for Nvidia. Microsoft is expected to grow its earnings 14.6% annually over the next three to five years.With Microsoft’s strong competitive positioning, durable growth, and relatively low macro risk, its premium multiple appears justified, however, most of the Magnificent 7 stocks appear attractively valued.Should Investors Buy Shares in MSFT?Microsoft continues to stand out as a well-rounded member of the Magnificent 7—delivering top-tier cloud growth, strong earnings momentum, and relatively low exposure to macro and geopolitical risks. Its premium valuation appears justified given its leadership in AI and enterprise business, and its stock performance reflects growing investor confidence.While many of its peers also look attractively valued after recent pullbacks, Microsoft remains a compelling core holding for long-term investors seeking stability, growth, and resilience in an uncertain market.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:49ab18d3a094b:0-the-standout-magnificent-7-stock-microsoft-s-quiet-dominance/

Nvidia Can Count On Tech Giants' Spending as 'Tough Regulations' Hit China Sales — Barrons.com,1746462660000,"By Angela PalumboSpending on artificial intelligence by so-called hyperscalers should continue to benefit Nvidia, helping to offset the damage from restrictions on chip exports, Melius Research says.All of the Magnificent Seven companies except for Nvidia have reported their most recent financial results this earnings season. A common theme was that regardless of uncertainty about the economic outlook, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet all plan to continue spending big on AI.That is a good sign for Nvidia, Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a research note on Monday.""The AI race is particularly existential for hyperscalers as each seeks some form of 'Universal Assistant' that can do it all (Project Astra for Google, MetaAI, Copilot) and ultimately corral more ad, cloud and subscription revenues,"" Reitzes wrote. He said that even if the hyperscalers, as the tech giants are known, make their own custom semiconductors, he believes spending on Nvidia's chips needs to ""grow rapidly,"" to help them achieve their goals.""Nvidia has some amazing new products (GB300 and Vera Rubin), which should drive growth even amidst tough regulations,"" he added.Nvidia shares have dropped 15% this year, compared with a 3.8% decline in the S&P 500. Part of the reason is concern over tighter U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China. BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya wrote on Monday that as a result of the rules, Nvidia could be facing a 20% reduction in the long-term $500 billion total addressable market for its hardware.""We learned that $15-$20 billion of run-rate sales (about 10% of Data Center segment) into China have evaporated — so upside in Hyperscaler capex in 2025 and 2026 is even more important now,"" Reitzes wrote.He maintained his Buy rating on Nvidia and $150 price target, which implies a 31% increase to the stock's closing price of $114.50 on Friday. Shares of Nvidia were down 0.8% on Monday to $113.52.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Meta to Delay Rollout of Flagship AI Model Nicknamed 'Behemoth,' Sources Say — WSJ",1747336620000,"By Meghan Bobrowsky and Sam SchechnerMeta is delaying the rollout of a flagship AI model, prompting internal concerns about the direction of its multibillion-dollar AI investments, people familiar with the matter said.Company engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its ""Behemoth"" large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release, the people said.Early in its development, Behemoth was internally slated for an April release to coincide with Meta's inaugural AI conference for developers. Meta put out two smaller models in its Llama AI model family ahead of the event, but later pushed an internal target for the larger Behemoth's release to June. Now, it's been delayed to fall or later.Meta has previously drawn praise for the speed with which it's caught up to rivals in the global AI arms race--spending billions of dollars along the way to develop the technology that powers chatbots on WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. Meta plans to spend up to $72 billion in capital expenditures this year, much of which will be used to help realize Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's grand ambitions for AI.Zuckerberg and other Meta executives haven't publicly committed to a timeline for Behemoth. The company could ultimately decide to release Behemoth sooner than expected, including by rolling out a more limited version. But Meta engineers and researchers are concerned its performance wouldn't match public statements about its capabilities, the people said.A Meta spokesman declined to comment.Senior executives at the company are frustrated at the performance of the team that built the Llama 4 models and blame them for the failure to make progress on Behemoth, according to people familiar with their views. Meta is contemplating significant management changes to its AI product group as a result, the people said.The Facebook-parent has publicly touted the capabilities of Behemoth, saying it already outperforms similar technology from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on some tests. But internally, its performance has been hobbled by training challenges, the people said.Meta's recent challenges mirror stumbles or delays at other top AI companies that are trying to release their next big state-of-the-art models. Some researchers see the pattern as evidence that future advances in AI models could come at a far slower pace than in the past, and at tremendous cost.""Right now, the progress is quite small across all the labs, all the models,"" said Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an assistant professor and faculty fellow at New York University's Center for Data Science.GPT-5, one of OpenAI's next big technological leaps forward, was initially expected around mid-2024, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. In December, The Journal reported that development on the model was running behind schedule.In February, OpenAI Chief Sam Altman said the model would be released as GPT-4.5 and that GPT-5 — the model they hoped would come with bigger technological breakthroughs — was still months away. ChatGPT currently runs on versions of GPT-4o. OpenAI declined to comment on the timing of GPT-5's release.Anthropic last year said it was working on a new model called Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger version of the AI models it released last year and has continued to update. That heftier version still hasn't been released. A spokeswoman says Opus is coming soon.Meta's first version of Llama was produced by its Fundamental AI Research Team, which largely consists of academics and researchers with doctorate degrees. The team released the models and a research paper explaining them to the public in early 2023.Since then, 11 of the 14 researchers on that original paper have left the company. The Llama models since the first ones have been developed by a different team. The Information earlier reported on problems Meta was having with some of its recent Llama models.The two models that were released in April initially performed well on a popular AI chatbot leaderboard. However, it was later revealed that the model submitted to the leaderboard was not the same model that was released to the public.Representatives for the leaderboard said Meta should have made it clearer that it had submitted a customized model intended to do well on its benchmark test. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Meta submitted a version of its AI model to the leaderboard that was optimized to do well on the third-party performance test.Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at Sam.Schechner@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250515011062:0/
Market Chatter: Apple Looks to Launch Smart Glasses by 2026-end; Pauses Smartwatch With Camera Plans,1747943398000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL is planning to launch its smart glasses, a rival to Meta Platforms' NASDAQ:META Ray-Bans, by the end of 2026, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Deutsche Bank and Caesars Entertainment have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1746453000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 5, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Deutsche Bank DB as the Bull of the Day and Caesars Entertainment CZR as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Dell Technologies DELL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:With many analysts turning bullish on European equities, it's noteworthy that Deutsche Bank stock was recently added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list.Landing the Bull of the Day, Deutsche Bank’s Zacks Banks-Foreign Industry is currently in the top 4% of over 240 Zacks industries. For those who haven’t noticed, Deutsche Bank’s American Depositary Receipt (ADR) has been one of the top performers this year, soaring over +50% in 2025 while the broader indexes work out of correction territory in regard to U.S. markets. Trading at 52-week highs of $26 a share, there could still be more upside for Deutsche Bank stock based on a pleasant trend of earnings estimate revisions. High Sentiment for European EquitiesWith sentiment improving regarding concerns over tariffs and economic uncertainty, European markets have been resilient. Goldman Sachs (GS), for instance, sees strong corporate earnings in Europe and higher defense spending as a major catalyst. This comes as there has reportedly been a record rotation of global investors shifting away from U.S. equities and increasing their European stock holdings.Notably, Deutsche Bank analysts have shifted to a positive outlook on other European stocks, based on improved market conditions and reduced geopolitical tensions. Despite the European Union (EU) not being immune to higher tariffs from Washington, many pundits have pointed out that their biggest trade partners are still each other.Deutsche Bank’s Outlook As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, Deutsche Bank’s steady expansion has kept investors engaged. Being the largest bank in Germany, Deutsche Bank’s total sales are expected to be up 7% in fiscal 2025 and are projected to increase another 2% in FY26 to $35.39 billion.More intriguing and relating to Goldman Sachs' bullish commentary on European equities is that Deutsche Bank’s annual earnings are currently slated to soar 116% this year to $3.20 per share, compared to EPS of $1.48 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to rise another 11%.Positive EPS RevisionsExtending Deutsche Bank’s rally has been rising earnings estimate revisions. As shown below, FY25 EPS estimates (F1) have risen 9% over the last 60 days and are now up 23% from a year ago. Even better, FY26 EPS estimates (F2) have popped 14% in the last two months and have increased 26% over the last year.Conclusion & Final ThoughtsDeutsche Bank’s selection as the Bull of the Day is not to say that investors should shift away from U.S. equities, but it wouldn’t be surprising if the rally in DB continued with shares still trading at 8X forward earnings and less than 1X sales.Furthermore, diversification is an effective hedge against economic uncertainty, and Deutsche Bank is worthy of consideration outside of the renowned U.S. banks that typically catch investors' attention.Bear of the Day:As U.S. markets work their way out of correction territory, consumer sentiment has still dropped significantly in recent months, and some Leisure and Recreation services companies may take the brunt of the hit.One such company could be casino and resort operator Caesars Entertainment, with its stock having a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and landing the Bear of the Day. Caesars Q1 Earnings MissReporting its Q1 results last Tuesday, Caesars Entertainment posted a much wider adjusted loss than expected at -$0.54 a share compared to estimates of -$0.19. This was despite Q1 sales of $2.79 billion topping expectations of $2.78 billion. Still, Caesars Entertainment has missed top and bottom-line expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports, which has raised investors' concerns.Caesars Dismal Stock PerformanceYear to date, Caesars Entertainment’s stock is down 17% to trail the S&P 500’s -5% and has lagged its Zacks Leisure & Recreation Services Market’s -13%. More concerning, CZR has now plummeted more than 50% in the last three years.Declining EPS RevisionsUnfortunately, more downside risk could be ahead for Caesars Entertainment’s stock as earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline following the company’s lackluster Q1 results.Over the last quarter, fiscal 2025 EPS estimates have now sunk 70% from estimates of $1.25 per share to $0.37. Although Caesars Entertainment’s EPS growth may look intriguing, FY26 earnings estimates have fallen 40% from three months ago, from $2.17 a share to $1.28.Bottom Line Based on its very dismal stock performance and the steep decline in earnings estimate revisions, it’s best to avoid Caesars Entertainment’s stock for now. To that point, the consumer discretionary sector will likely feel the effects of any further economic uncertainty, and there could be less demand for non-essential recreational activities.mAdditional content:Buy, Hold or Sell AMD Ahead of Q1 Earnings?Advanced Micro Devices is set to release its first-quarter 2025 results on May 6.AMD expects first-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.1 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and a sequential decline of approximately 7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD's first-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.12 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 30.11%. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 93 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The earnings estimate indicates growth of 50% on a year-over-year basis.AMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.32%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar).Let's see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.AMD's Data Center & Client Segment Revenues to Grow Y/YAMD's first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from growth in both its data center and client segments, driven by continued demand for its EPYC processors and Ryzen chips. The data center segment, in particular, has been a major contributor to AMD's success, and the company expects this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.AMD expects the Data Center segment's revenues to significantly increase, driven by the strong sales of its data center chips that support hyperscalers and power AI and Generative AI applications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Data Center revenues is pegged at $3.4 billion, indicating an impressive year-over-year surge of 47.5%.The company is likely to see continued growth in its client business, driven by higher demand for Ryzen processors across desktop and mobile platforms. AMD's collaborations, such as the one with Dell Technologies for Ryzen Pro processors in commercial PCs, are expected to have bolstered growth in this segment in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Client segment revenues is pegged at $2.04 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 49.3%.Weak Embedded & Gaming to Hurt AMD's Q1 ResultsAMD's near-term prospects suffer from weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments. On a year-over-year basis, these segments' revenues are expected to have declined.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Embedded revenues is pegged at $570 million, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming revenues is pegged at $509 million, suggesting a massive 38.1% decline.AMD Stock Underperforms Sector & IndustryAdvanced Micro Devices shares have lost 17.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's decrease of 9% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry's decline of 7.2%.AMD stock is not so cheap, as its Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales, Advanced Micro Devices is currently trading at 4.68X, higher than the Computer – Integrated Systems industry's 2.90X.AMD Benefits from Rich Partner BaseAMD benefits from a rich partner base, which includes Microsoft, Oracle, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo, Meta Platforms and IBM having Instinct platforms in production.The demand for AI accelerators like the Instinct MI300 series, especially from hyperscalers, is expected to continue growing, further boosting data center revenues in the first quarter of 2025. In the Data Center AI business, MI300X deployment increased with cloud partners, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, IBM, Digital Ocean and Dell Technologies, among others.Meta Platforms used MI300X to power its Llama 405B frontier model on meta.ai. It added instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads.Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services. IBM announced plans to enable MI300X on its Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications.Dell Technologies started offering MI300X as part of its AI factory solution suite. DELL is providing multiple ready-to-deploy containers through its Dell Enterprise Hub on Hugging Face.ConclusionAMD's expanding portfolio and strategic acquisitions are expected to have improved its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter amid weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments, and fierce competition from NVIDIA.AMD has a Growth Score of C, which makes it unattractive for growth-oriented investors. Stretched valuation is another concern.AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

Meta Platforms vs. Microsoft: Which AI Superpower is a Better Buy?,1747335600000,"Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft’s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META’s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies. Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month. Microsoft is now extending Copilot’s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft. Since April 2, Microsoft shares have appreciated 18.6% while Meta Platforms returned 12.8%.META and MSFT Stock’s PerformanceMETA & MSFT’s Earnings Estimate Revisions PositiveThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for META’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.52 per share, up by 2.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 6.96% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Meta Platforms, Inc.

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

AppLovin Stock Plunges 26% in 3 Months: Is it a Smart Investment Now?,1747326660000,"AppLovin Corporation APP has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry’s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet GOOGL shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms META has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning.

Meta's Upside Jumps Nearly 40% as Loop Capital Raises Target,1747929393000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META gained fresh momentum after Loop Capital lifted its price target to $888 from $695, while keeping a Buy rating, according to a Thursday research note.The new forecast implies about 40% upside from current levels, reflecting the firm's confidence in Meta's growth trajectory.Loop Capital highlighted Meta's leading position among non-hardware beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, suggesting the stock may outperform its Magnificent Seven peers this year. Sanderson also pointed to Meta's stronger-than-anticipated second-quarter outlook as a key driver.Earlier concerns that reduced ad spending by China-based retailers would drag on revenue have eased. Meta confirmed in April that some Chinese online merchants cut back ads on Facebook and Instagram amid President Donald Trump's trade policies toward China. However, advancements in AI tools and services have helped offset those headwinds, according to Loop Capital.Despite broader market volatility, the bullish call underscores growing optimism around Meta's ability to monetize its AI investments and sustain ad revenue growth. Investors will watch the company's upcoming earnings report for further clues on whether Meta can meet heightened expectations and validate its lofty valuation.Is META Stock a Buy?Based on the one year price targets offered by 60 analysts, the average target price for Meta Platforms Inc is $706.21 with a high estimate of $935.00 and a low estimate of $466.00.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and Microsoft",1746451080000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 5, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Microsoft Corp. MSFT.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Should You Hold NVIDIA as Meta & Microsoft Double-Down on AI?NVIDIA Corp. stock gained nearly 2.5% on Thursday, buoyed by a renewed wave of optimism from two of its largest customers, Meta Platforms, Inc. and Microsoft Corp. . Both tech giants reaffirmed, and in Meta Platforms' case, raised their capital expenditure commitments toward AI infrastructure.This resurgence of AI-related investment could mark a key turning point for NVIDIA stock, which has pulled back 27% from its 52-week high of $153.13 attained on Jan. 7, 2025. With the renewed optimism about AI investment, the question arises: Should investors rush to buy more, or is holding the stock the smarter move right now?AI Spending Spree Could Reignite Demand for NVIDIA's ChipsMicrosoft, a major cloud provider and longtime NVIDIA partner, confirmed during its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call that it will maintain its massive $80 billion capital expenditure plan for AI data centers, with more than half of that directed toward U.S. operations.Meanwhile, during its first-quarter 2025 earnings call, Meta Platforms increased its 2025 capital spending outlook to a range of $64-$72 billion, up from the prior $60-$65 billion range. The added spending will primarily go toward expanding data center capacity and AI infrastructure, both heavily reliant on NVIDIA's high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).Meta Platforms' CFO, Susan Li, made it clear that the CapEx bump is driven by AI ambitions and infrastructure upgrades. Similarly, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood indicated that fiscal 2026 investments will grow, albeit at a slower pace, and be more closely aligned with short-term revenue gains, implying accelerated AI workload deployments.These commitments are strong signals that NVIDIA's chips, especially its H100 and upcoming B100 GPUs, will remain in high demand as hyperscalers scale their AI platforms.AI Boom Driving NVIDIA's Financial PerformanceNVIDIA's products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues from the data center end-market grew 93% year over year to $35.58 billion and contributed 90.5% to the total sales.AI-driven workloads, cloud computing expansion and increasing enterprise adoption of AI models have turned NVIDIA's high-performance chips into a necessity rather than a luxury. With businesses aggressively investing in AI infrastructure, NVIDIA remains positioned at the heart of this technological transformation.Financially, NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues surged 78% year over year, while non-GAAP EPS climbed 71%. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance of $43 billion in revenues represents a staggering increase from $26.04 billion in the prior-year quarter.Analysts expect NVIDIA to maintain this momentum, forecasting fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenue growth of 48% and 24%, respectively. With earnings projected to rise 42% in fiscal 2026 and 27% in fiscal 2027, NVIDIA's long-term investment case remains intact. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.9%.NVIDIA Overvaluation Warrants a CautionValuation-wise, NVIDIA is overvalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of D.However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, NVDA shares are trading at 13.32X, higher than the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry's 10.96X.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowNVIDIA's stock may be off its highs, but the AI megatrend is very much alive and is receiving fresh fuel from the likes of Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Their deep-pocketed commitments to AI infrastructure spending underscore NVIDIA's strategic importance in the evolving tech landscape. However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility. For now, holding the stock is the smartest approach.Currently, NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We expect NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3% by 2027.While a solid resurgence in deal-making activities is likely to take time, a solid pipeline will drive the Investment Banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to witness a CAGR of 2.1% by 2027.

Wall Street futures slip after three-day rally as traders await Powell speech,1747307739000,"US stock futures edged lower Thursday after three straight days of gains, as markets digested a temporary truce in U.S.-China tariff tensions and eyed fresh economic data for clues on inflation and growth. All eyes now turn to US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to speak at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference in Washington, D.C., on May 15. Powell faces mounting pressure from President Trump, who has been openly urging the Fed to begin cutting interest rates.Futures linked to the S&P 500 were down 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.7 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also declined, falling 128 points, or 0.3 percent.Also read: Told Apple CEO Tim Cook that I don't want him to build in India: Donald TrumpThe cautious mood followed news that Washington and Beijing have paused their tit-for-tat tariff war, easing some pressure on equities.

Meanwhile, UnitedHealth dropped 6 percent following reports of a Justice Department probe—although the company said it has not been notified of any such investigation.Tech giants continued to lead the rally this week. Nvidia and Tesla have jumped more than 16 percent, while Meta Platforms has surged 11.3 percent. Amazon and Alphabet also notched gains of more than 8 percent.

"Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",1746447000000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 5, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL.Earnings Remain Resilient, but Outlook SoftensThe market loved the Microsoft and Meta Platforms results, liked parts of the Amazon report, but didn't like the Apple numbers. With these reports, we now have Q1 results from 6 members of the 'Magnificent 7' group.The aggregate growth numbers for the group are impressive, but there is a considerable variance among the Mag 7 players. The year-over-year earnings growth rates range from -56.8% at Tesla, +4.8% from Apple, +42.6% from Amazon, and +46% from Alphabet.The companies are sticking with their capex plans, which has remained a sticking point with market participants in recent quarters. The DeepSeek shock notwithstanding, they all see continued spending on building out their AI infrastructure as critical to their long-term competitive positioning. For some, like Alphabet's Google search franchise, is seen as under threat in the emerging AI world, and the company remains determined to defend its territory.Amazon, the leader in the cloud space, showed decelerating growth, which they pinned on capacity constraints in its datacenter assets. Revenues in the cloud business (Amazon Web Services) were up +16.9% to $29.3 billion, just a hair below consensus estimates. This is down from +18.9% year-over-year growth in AWS revenues in the preceding period (2024 Q4) and +19.1% in the quarter before that (2024 Q3).In other words, a steady decelerating growth trend in the cloud unit's revenues. The deceleration in Amazon's cloud revenues was expected and also in line with what we had seen from Alphabet. Revenue growth trends for Microsoft's cloud business were much better compared to what we saw from Alphabet and Amazon.We suspect that some in the market had been hoping that Amazon's cloud revenues would show the type of growth momentum that we saw from Microsoft. Amazon's cloud numbers aren't bad, but they aren't great.Amazon's modestly lowered Q2 earnings guidance wasn't tariffs-related, but rather a function of the timing of certain operating expenses. The company's revenue guidance aligned with consensus expectations, spotlighting the resilience of the company's business model in this challenging operating environment. This is particularly so on the retail side, where roughly half of the sellers on the site are based in China, and even the other half that are domestically based source a significant proportion of their inventory from that market. Looked at this way, Amazon's Q2 guidance is fairly reassuring.Of these Mag 7 players, Apple had the most pronounced tariff impact, with June quarter gross margins impacted by about 100 basis points. Given the all-around uncertainty, the company didn't provide a lot of color on the period. For the March period, Apple's earnings increased +4.8% on +5.1% higher revenues.Apple's underperformance has more to do with its China exposure than anything else. The company has good plans in place to shift iPhone assembly to India, particularly for shipments to the U.S. market. But the stock's performance suggests that the market remains skeptical of the plan's success.The other aspect of the company's exposure to China is the market's position as a significant contributor to revenues and earnings. To that end, Apple is not only faced with regular competitive pressures from local rivals, but also has to contend with its status as an American consumer brand in a Chinese environment when local consumers may be less inclined to patronize it on nationalist grounds.Please note that estimates for the Mag 7 group have started coming under pressure lately after remaining very strong over the last two years. The better-than-expected Q1 earnings results have helped reverse this negative trend, at least for now. Today's +11% earnings growth expected this year is up from +9.9% earnings growth expected last week, but down from +15.7% that was expected three months ago.Please note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 23.9% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2025, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 18.3% in 2023. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 30.6% weight in the index. If this group of mega-cap companies was a stand-alone sector, it would be the second biggest in the S&P 500 index, just behind the Technology sector at 38.7% and above the Finance sector at 13.5%.Key Earnings Reports This WeekWe have over 1300 companies on deck to report results this coming week, including 94 S&P 500 members.The bellwethers reporting this week range from Ford, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Uber, DoorDash, and many others. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q1 results from more than 90% of the index's total membership.Q1 Earnings ScorecardThrough Friday, May 2nd, we have seen Q1 results from 358 S&P 500 members or 71.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 358 index members are up +13.4% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 72.6% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.The EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 72.6% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78.8% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The revenue beats percentage is also tracking below the 20-quarter average, but by a larger amount.Estimates Come Under PressureLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 358 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period.We noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further as companies report results and talk up the extent of uncertainty around their near-term business outlook.Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. The ongoing market weakness is essentially a reflection of these diminished earnings expectations.Estimates for full-year 2025 have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the negative revisions trend becoming very meaningful and widespread since mid-February 2025.Estimates have been cut for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Aerospace and Construction as the only sectors enjoying modest positive revisions since mid-February. Sectors suffering the biggest cuts to estimates since mid-February include Transportation, Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, Tech, Finance, and others.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Earnings Expectations Shift Lower: A Closer LookWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta ",1747295340000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 15, 2025 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues.""Making Sense of the Evolving Earnings PictureNote: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates. - We continue to believe that this earnings season was less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the evolving macroeconomic and public policy backdrop. To that end, management commentary has largely been reassuring despite the uncertainty. - Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been under pressure, with bigger declines in estimates compared to other recent post-COVID periods. That said, estimates for the Tech sector have notably stabilized lately. - For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. Q2 estimates have been steadily coming down, with the magnitude and breadth of negative estimate revisions greater than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.What’s Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates?The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariff uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have declined since the quarter began.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.4% in Q2 on +9.8% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed course in recent weeks, as we have been flagging lately.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector’s estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector’s Q2 estimates at least proves that the shift to the annual growth pace isn’t solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly from the Mag 7 players. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company’s current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.You can rest assured that we will be closely monitoring the Tech sector’s revisions trend in the days ahead.The Earnings Big PictureWhile estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven’t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy’s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold AppLovin Stock Before Q1 Earnings?",1746446160000,"AppLovin Corporation APP will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 7, after the bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter stands at $1.45, indicating 116.4% growth from the year-ago reported quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues stands at $1.38 billion, implying 30.2% year-over-year growth. There has been no change in analyst estimates or revisions lately.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an earnings surprise of 23.5%, on average.Q1 Earnings Beat Seems Unlikely for APPOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for APP this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.APP has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Software Platform Should Drive Performance GrowthWe expect year-over-year improvement in the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter to be driven mainly by an increase in the Software Platform. The consensus estimate for the Software Platform revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion, indicating 54.3% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for Appsrevenuesis pegged at $331.7 million, suggesting a 12.7% year-over-year decline.The consensus mark for the Software Platform’s adjusted EBITDA is pegged at $829.4 million, suggesting 68.6% year-over-year growth. APP’s adjusted EBITDA is expected to decrease 16.8% year over year.APP Stock is in a Great MoodAPP has rallied a staggering 300% over the past year, easily outpacing the broader industry's 27% gain. In contrast, competitors like Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META have delivered mixed results. Alphabet shares slipped 2% during the same time frame, highlighting weakness in parts of its ad-driven business. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms climbed 29%, benefiting from its strong position in social media advertising. Both Alphabet and Meta Platforms remain major players, but AppLovin’s specialized platform is delivering superior returns in this niche.Investment Risk and Rewards for APPAppLovin's recent financial results underscore its strong fundamentals and impressive growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the fourth quarter of 2024, revenues surged 44% year over year and 14% sequentially, reflecting strong market demand. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 78% year over year and 17.5% sequentially, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 248% from the prior year and 38% sequentially, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability.For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency. Looking ahead, management has guided for $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025 sales, slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 billion. Historically, AppLovin has consistently beaten earnings expectations, increasing the likelihood of another outperformance.However, potential risks persist. The growth in the in-game advertising segment may face challenges, and the uncertain impact of the company’s ventures outside gaming could introduce volatility. Nonetheless, AppLovin's strategic focus on innovative technology and expansion within the gaming industry positions it well for sustained growth. With AXON 2.0 driving operational efficiencies and a diversified approach to revenue generation, the company is poised to maintain its growth momentum, making it an attractive option for long-term investors.Hold RecommendationThe stock has delivered exceptional growth over the past year, with the company showing robust financial results driven by its Software Platform and AXON 2.0 technology. While first-quarter 2025 earnings are expected to show strong year-over-year growth, the absence of a positive Earnings ESP and modest decline in App revenues suggest potential volatility. Still, APP’s consistent earnings beats, operational efficiency, and leadership in mobile advertising make it a compelling long-term play. Given near-term uncertainty around earnings and potential sector risks, a Hold is prudent as investors await clearer post-earnings direction and sustained performance confirmation.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e324b107c094b:0-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-applovin-stock-before-q1-earnings/

Britain tells antitrust regulator to focus on economic growth,1747263660000,"Britain on Thursday told its antitrust regulator to get behind its push for economic growth and minimise uncertainty for businesses by making more timely, transparent and responsive interventions in merger control, digital markets and consumer protection.Since taking power last year, the Labour government has stepped up pressure on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and other regulators, demanding they play their part in tearing down barriers that hold back growth.The CMA is independent but it follows a ""strategic steer"" set by the secretary of state for business. ""Our economic regulators are crucial to creating the conditions for increased growth and investment,"" Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said in a government statement. ""This steer sets out the government's priorities for the CMA."" Reynolds signalled the CMA's new steer in February , saying it needed to be ""less risk-adverse"". The CMA gained new powers to scrutinise ""big tech"" companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon at the beginning of this year, adding to a widened remit to police mergers after Brexit.Prime Minister Keir Starmer singled the CMA out last year as a regulator that needed to take economic growth more seriously. The government reinforced the point by making former Amazon executive Doug Gurr interim chair of the CMA in January.CMA CEO Sarah Cardell said the government had situated a strong competition regime ""squarely in the context of the growth mission"".""The steer provides helpful clarity on how the CMA should prioritise and go about our work, promoting competition and protecting consumers with a sharp focus on supporting higher levels of investment and economic growth,"" she said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RM28Z:0-britain-tells-antitrust-regulator-to-focus-on-economic-growth/"
"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H. Cho***Classes and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.Young people are also managing their finances in new ways. Generative artificial intelligence can take on the tedious task of budgeting, and the growing buy-now-pay-later industry grants the power to purchase almost anything in installments.MarketWatch spoke with money experts who offered advice on how to use the latest finance tools responsibly, and to remind graduates not to forget these tried and true personal finance habits.For more on this, read here.- Genna Contino***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert Steiner, Callum Keown This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Forget 'Sell in May': 5 Factors Why Wall Street ETFs Could Rally Ahead,1746435060000,"Wall Street has seen a strong start to May 2025, going against the old adage, “sell in May and go away,” after a subdued April . In April, the S&P 500 lost 1.8%, the Dow Jones retreated 3.7%, the Nasdaq Composite was off 0.9%, and the Russell 2000 plunged about 4%.However, U.S. stocks are showing signs of a recovery to start May, marking a significant comeback for major indexes, led by a strong jobs report and a possible breakthrough in U.S.-China trade negotiations.Longest S&P 500 Winning Streak Since 2004The S&P 500 jumped nearly 1.5% on May 3, 2025, surpassing its April 2 closing level — referred to by President Trump as “Liberation Day,” when sweeping tariffs were announced. The S&P 500 marked its longest winning streak since November 2004, closing higher for multiple sessions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4% on May 3, logging its ninth consecutive winning day. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite also climbed roughly 1.5% on Friday. We expect this to be the start of a market recovery, which we can see throughout this month.Weekly Market PerformanceFriday’s Wall Street rally capped off a strong week for U.S. equities. The Dow rose 3%, the S&P 500 added nearly 3%, and the Nasdaq outperformed with a 3.4% gain. Optimism over Big Tech earnings and signs of progress in trade discussions were key drivers of the weekly surge.Below, we highlight a few factors that suggest May could be a charged-up month for Wall Street.Recent History Didn’t Favor the “Sell in May” AdageLarry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. “Historically, if we go back over the past ten years, 'sell in May' hasn't actually worked too well.”The phrase ""Sell in May and go away"" began in London, where traders would exit markets in summer and return after the Saint Leger horse race in September — a strategy that became popular in the United States from 1960 to 1987.However, after the 1987 market crash, staying invested through summer generally became more profitable. While the S&P 500 has averaged just 1.8% returns from May to October since 1950, it has still posted gains 65% of the time, challenging the need for seasonal exits, per LPL Financial data, quoted on Yahoo Finance.April Job Report Beats ExpectationsMarkets were buoyed by a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, exceeding economists’ expectations of 138,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, signaling continued strength in the labor market despite recent volatility tied to tariff fears.Hopes Rise for U.S.-China Trade TalksInvestor optimism was further fueled by news from Beijing. China’s commerce ministry indicated openness to talks, saying the ""door is open"" for negotiations if the United States agrees to scale back reciprocal tariffs. This development suggested a possible thaw in trade tensions that had rattled markets in April.Tech Giants React to Tariff PressuresDespite strong earnings, some tech giants felt the pressure of trade uncertainty. Apple AAPL reported a $900 million tariff headwind this quarter and cut its share buyback program by $10 billion, causing its stock to dip. Amazon AMZN posted solid earnings but offered cautious guidance, citing tariffs and trade policy as key concerns.While such concerns may instigate the administration to take a softer stance on trade deals, some tech giants came up with upbeat outlooks even in this strained scenario.Strong outlook from software giant Microsoft MSFT and Facebook parent Meta Platforms META spread strong optimism in the tech sector.Meta boosted AI Spending as advertising outlook appeared “healthy” despite tariff concerns. Meta shares posted its strongest week since February 2024. Microsoft too expects capital expenditures to rise from here as the company continues to expand data center capacity as the cloud and AI can benefit every business’s growth. Microsoft shares soared over 11% last week, marking its best performance since March 2023.Meanwhile, Alphabet GOOGL also plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to expand on its artificial intelligence strategy.The figure beat the $58.84 billion that Wall Street expected, according to FactSet, as quoted on CNBC.Trump's April Tariff Revenues SurgeTariffs under President Trump had a tangible impact last month, with the U.S. government collecting over $17.4 billion in Customs and Certain Excise Taxes in April. That figure nearly doubled March’s total of $9.6 billion, marking a sharp rise and far surpassing the smaller revenue spikes observed earlier in Trump’s presidency. The biggest tariffs — 10% duties on nearly every country in the world — took effect on April 5.While this can be a short-term boost, a decent increase in tariff revenues is probably guaranteed at this level. Plus, Trump’s believe that “the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax” could be a long-term benefit for corporations and consumers.ETFs to BuyAgainst this backdrop, investors can buy a few top-ranked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have higher chances of outperforming amid the new-found optimism.iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV – Up 14.8% Past Month (as of May 3, 2025)This is a high-momentum fund and should benefit from the ongoing AI boom.

Making Sense of the Evolving Earnings Picture,1747263180000,"Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 456 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.1% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 62.1% beating revenue estimates.- We continue to believe that this earnings season was less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the evolving macroeconomic and public policy backdrop. To that end, management commentary has largely been reassuring despite the uncertainty.- Estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been under pressure, with bigger declines in estimates compared to other recent post-COVID periods. That said, estimates for the Tech sector have notably stabilized lately.- For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. Q2 estimates have been steadily coming down, with the magnitude and breadth of negative estimate revisions greater than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.What’s Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates? The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariff uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. The chart below shows how Q2 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the start of the year.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have declined since the quarter began.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.4% in Q2 on +9.8% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed course in recent weeks, as we have been flagging lately. You can see this reversal in the sector’s revisions trend in the chart below.This favorable turn in the Tech sector’s revisions trend can be seen in expectations for full-year 2025 as well, as the chart below shows.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector’s estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector’s Q2 estimates at least proves that the shift to the annual growth pace isn’t solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly from the Mag 7 players. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company’s current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.You can rest assured that we will be closely monitoring the Tech sector’s revisions trend in the days ahead.The Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q1 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis.While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven’t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy’s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e7a8f21e4094b:0-making-sense-of-the-evolving-earnings-picture/

What Big Tech Earnings Taught Us — and Didn't — About Tariffs — Barrons.com,1746421200000,"By Angela PalumboSix of the Magnificent Seven have reported their financial results this earnings season, giving investors some much-needed insight into how the world's largest tech companies are being impacted by tariffs.Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Apple have all reported earnings over the last two weeks, making Nvidia the only Mag Seven company left.Heading into earnings season, the tariffs put in place by the Trump administration raised concerns that companies would increase their prices to offset the levies, leading to a pullback of consumer and enterprise spending — and a potential recession.So far, the results have only told Wall Street that tech ""companies are just as confused as everybody else,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Barron's.""Most of them are having a difficult time parsing out how tariffs will affect them, partially because it's a moving target,"" he added. ""They don't necessarily know how it's all gonna end.""Apple gave the clearest insights into how it could be impacted. CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call Thursday that the company expects to take a $900 million hit from tariffs for the June quarter.Meanwhile, Amazon, another massive consumer-facing brand, said it is closely monitoring the effect of tariffs, while doing ""everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense.""Tesla withheld second-quarter guidance as the company measures the ""impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains.""The rest of the Mag Seven was mostly quiet on the topic, with Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft providing better-than-expected guidance with mentions of macro uncertainty.One trend has emerged, however — a slowdown in ad spending. Alphabet and Meta are starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back budgets since the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption. That exemption previously allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs.Chinese companies Shein and Temu — known for their low priced items — may not want to put as much money into advertising if consumers stop spending because of price increases.But while advertising strength is now in question, software remains a haven for tech investors. Enterprises are still spending on artificial intelligence powered software meant to lower costs and increase productivity down the line.""It's pretty clear where the tariffs can be applied on real world goods. But, when it comes to services — and a lot of these big software companies are moving more towards software as a service — they're not as exposed to tariffs,"" Sosnick said.For the most part, investors can breathe a sigh of relief that tech companies remain on solid ground. But as trade policy continues to evolve, it's clear uncertainty will be sticking around.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

$30B AI Opportunity: Will It Power Meta’s Next Surge?,1747864260000,"Magnificent Seven giant Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META has been no stranger to Wall Street analyst upgrades lately. After the company’s last earnings report, nearly 20 analysts tracked by MarketBeat increased their price targets on the stock. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] More recently, analysts at Wolfe Research issued a substantial  price target update on Meta of $750. This implies a significant potential upside in Meta shares of nearly 18% from its May 20 closing price.Mark Zuckerberg recently shared five key AI growth opportunities for the company. This makes an earlier piece of Wolfe's research particularly relevant. Wolfe has referenced the huge growth potential of one opportunity that Zuckerberg mentioned: business messaging. It sees business messaging as a possible $30–$40 billion opportunity for Meta.Zuckerberg's recent comments suggest that business messaging might help Meta hit Wolfe's $750 12-month price target. This analysis will break down Meta’s ambitions in business messaging and show just how powerful they could be for the tech stock.Over a Third of the World Population Is Using WhatsAppAside from Facebook and Instagram, Meta also owns possibly the world’s most-used direct messaging app, WhatsApp . In Meta’s Q1 2025 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated that WhatsApp has over 3 billion monthly active users . That is equal to around 38% of the world’s population of 8 billion. Zuckerberg also said that more than one billion people use Facebook Messenger every month.Additionally, users send just as many messages on Instagram each day as they do on Messenger. He summed up this massive user count and activity data by saying, “So, Business messaging should be the next pillar of our business.""It looks like Meta is gearing up to start aggressively monetizing its huge messaging user base. This could kick off the path toward Meta executing on Wolfe’s massive total addressable market revenue estimates in this space. Wolfe estimates that Meta is only generating around $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue from WhatsApp. That lines up with Meta’s latest earnings. Meta's Other Family of Apps Revenue, which houses WhatsApp, generated around $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. It also generated $510 million in revenue last quarter, growing by 34% from a year ago.Wolfe’s Estimates Indicate a Huge Opportunity for MetaAlthough the timeline around which Wolfe sees Meta achieving $30–$40 billion in business messaging revenue is uncertain, it could clearly be a huge growth driver for Meta. At the midpoints of Wolfe’s estimates , this would mean a 20x increase in Meta’s business messaging revenue . Additionally, $35 billion in business messaging revenue would be equal to over 20% of the $170 billion that Meta generated in the last 12 months. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Meta intends to increase the monetization of business messaging using AI. Zuckerberg envisions every company using an "" AI business agen t."" This agent handles customer service and runs sales campaigns through direct messaging. Meta would then presumably charge companies to do this through its messaging apps.Meta has already seen companies in Thailand and Vietnam using its messaging apps to aid their business. However, they use humans to do so because the cost of labor in those countries is low. The company believes that the use of AI agents can make doing this profitable in developed countries.However, Meta’s focus on monetizing AI in developed countries is somewhat curious. Only around 100 million of WhatsApp’s 3 billion monthly active users are in the United States. Additionally, data shows that most WhatsApp users are in emerging economies. If these economies already have low labor costs, will AI agents really change the adoption of business messaging? While they might not make a difference in whether business messaging is profitable overall in these countries, there is a solid chance they could  raise profitability , thus increasing adoption. This remains to be seen, as Meta is currently testing these AI features. Additionally, an amount of 100 million users is still around 30% of the population in the United States, meaning there is a big opportunity at home as well.With Proper Execution, Business Messaging Could Be Meta’s Next Big HitOverall, Meta’s business messaging ambitions should be a key area of focus for investors going forward. However, it seems reasonable to pump the brakes on Wolfe’s huge forecasts in this area until more tangible results for Meta’s AI agents surface. If successful, business messaging represents a huge possible growth opportunity for one of the most dominant technology names in the world.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:dd1dc9895094b:0-30b-ai-opportunity-will-it-power-meta-s-next-surge/
"To Win Monopoly Fight, Meta Is Touting a Rival: TikTok — WSJ",1746356400000,"By Dave MichaelsWASHINGTON — Weeks into an antitrust trial that threatens the future of Meta Platforms' social-media empire, the company's best bet for a court victory might lie with one of its rivals: TikTok.The Federal Trade Commission is seeking to break up Meta, alleging that it wields an illegal monopoly originally built more than a decade ago through Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. To prevail, the agency needs to show not only that Meta engaged in unlawful monopolization, but also that its dominance hasn't waned since. That is where TikTok comes in.The FTC has been methodically presenting evidence to support its claim that Meta has muscled out most competition in the market for consumers who use social media to connect with friends and family. Meta has sought to undercut that claim by arguing that the social-media marketplace has evolved into a form of entertainment and news. In today's world, Meta says, TikTok's short-form video platform is a formidable rival. That position has scored some points.Under questioning Wednesday from a Meta lawyer, a senior TikTok executive testified that his company isn't like Instagram and Facebook.""We are an app and we have social features, but I don't think of us as a social app,"" said Adam Presser, TikTok's head of operations.Meta's lawyers then highlighted a series of internal TikTok analyses that muddied the waters. ""YouTube and Instagram are TikTok's most important competitors,"" one management document from 2021 said.They cited other records as well. ""The short-video interfaces on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube are now virtually indistinguishable,"" TikTok told an Australian government agency in March.TikTok has added social features, such as a friends tab, that make it feel more like a social-networking product, noted Meta lawyer Aaron Panner.Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, in his own appearance on the witness stand last month, said Instagram and Facebook have become more like TikTok, moving from social networking to ""more of a broad discovery-entertainment space.""Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, mostly testified in support of the FTC's case. But he also made a similar observation about the transformation of social media.""The current horizon of the products is all about entertaining users with video content,"" Systrom told the court. ""Facebook certainly and TikTok certainly and Instagram certainly. And I'll give you one more, which would be YouTube.""The FTC maintains that Facebook puts personal connections at the heart of the experience. Some of Meta's internal documents introduced in court by the FTC, such as survey data, show that people mainly value Facebook and Instagram for keeping up with friends and family.TikTok, on the other hand, relies on an algorithm that determines which videos to show. The algorithm doesn't really care whether the user knows the person who made the video , according to Presser and other witnesses. The point is to keep the user engaged with the app.U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is deciding the case without a jury, hasn't revealed much about his views so far, though some of his questions have suggested he isn't an avid user of social media.He has sometimes questioned whether the different social-media platforms are really all that different, noting that they have many of the same features.""Why isn't the way these are used now just a difference in degree?"" Boasberg asked one FTC witness.The commission is expected to continue presenting its case for at least another week. It has spent a majority of its time so far attempting to establish that Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp for the express purpose of neutralizing them as potential competitors.FTC's lawyers have entered into evidence dozens of internal Meta emails and presentations that portrayed Zuckerberg and other executives as deeply worried that Instagram and mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp would erode Facebook's business and put it at a particular disadvantage on mobile devices.Before it bought WhatsApp in 2014, for instance, Meta foresaw mobile messaging apps, which were particularly popular in Asia, as invading its social networking turf.""Can you guys compile a this-sh — -is-getting-scary deck given all of the data we have now?"" Javier Olivan, now Meta's chief operating officer, wrote in one email.Even after Zuckerberg bought Instagram in 2012, he struggled with how much to promote the photo-sharing app, worried that its growth could cannibalize Facebook, according to testimony from Systrom. Meta denied its request for more resources to support video, spam-fighting, and data safety in 2018, when Instagram passed one billion users, Systrom said.Systrom said his app could have grown into a formidable competitor to Facebook if it had remained independent. But under questioning from one of Meta's lawyers, he acknowledged that Meta's support fueled its rapid growth between 2012 and 2018.""We grew much more quickly because we were part of Facebook than we would have as an independent company,"" Systrom said.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250504000194:0/
CoreWeave: Riding the AI Wave Ahead of Earnings,1747229520000,"What Does CoreWeave Do?In simple terms, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock CoreWeave ( CRWV ) is an AI cloud-computing company that functions as a massive computer rental platform, providing super-powered services for artificial intelligence operations and other resource-intensive tasks. The late 2022 launch of OpenAI and Microsoft’s ( MSFT ) ChatGPT chatbot illustrated how significant AI technology is and is likely to become when it became the fastest-growing consumer application in history. Since then, big-tech, “Magnificent 7” companies like Meta Platforms ( META ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars of CAPEX on data centers and the GPUs that are necessary to train large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.Coreweave, founded in 2017, initially provided data center capability to Bitcoin miners. However, a crypto crash would alter the company’s trajectory the next year forever. Instead of focusing on crypto, CoreWeave’s management team correctly predicted that the next (and much larger) wave of data center demand would come from AI. Thus, the company pivoted, and growth exploded.CoreWeave: The Biggest Tech IPO Since 2021In late March, CoreWeave launched its IPO, raising $1.5 billion. While the $1.5 billion was lower than CoreWeave wanted to raise and below Wall Street’s expectations, context is critical. The market conditions at the time were dire, with an intensifying trade war between the world’s two largest economies. In most cases, a tech company would simply shelf its IPO. More importantly, China’s DeepSeek large language model had just launched and claimed to provide a ChatGPT-like product with far less compute.CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator would later say that demand had actually picked up in the wake of the DeepSeek madness. Later, Wall Street analysts would also debunk DeepSeek’s claims. Despite the uncertainty and investor skittishness, CRWV management forged ahead and launched the IPO, marking the largest tech IPO in years.CoreWeave: The Google 2004 PrecedentFamed investor Jesse Livermore once proclaimed, “There is nothing new on Wall Street. There can’t be, because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market has happened before.” While history doesn’t always repeat exactly, it does tend to rhyme.In 2004, GOOGL launched its IPO. GOOGL shares would more than triple in a year, and would never look back. Now, CRWV exhibits some of the same characteristics, including:· IPO U-turn Base:In 2004, GOOGL shares spiked in their first few sessions, fell, and finally carved out a short, multi-week rounded base, which I call an IPO “U-turn” base.Image Source: TradingViewCRWV’s current chart pattern mirros the 2004 GOOGL IPO and should act as a valuable precedent for investors.Image Source: TradingView· Explosive Revenue GrowthIn the year prior before its IPO, Google’s revenue jumped from $961.90 million to $2.7 billion. Meanwhile, CoreWeave’s revenue grew at a blistering 725% in the year prior to its IPO.· Institutional SponsorshipDeep-pocketed institutional investors drove Google’s mind-boggling ascent, and now they are doing the same for CoreWeave. For instance, Nvidia ( NVDA ), the undisputed AI leader, owns 6% of CRWV. According to its latest filing BlackRock ( BLK ), the world’s largest asset manager, owns 250,000 shares. Meanwhile, Fidelity disclosed a 9% stake in the firm earlier this week.· New Technology WaveGoogle benefitted from riding the technological wave known as the internet. Now, CRWV is riding the newest and arguably fastest-growing wave in history: artificial intelligence.Fib Targets CRWVCorewWeave will report earnings after the close today, May 14th. If the company impress Wall Street, the Fibonacci targets are much higher.Image Source: TradingViewBottom LineAs CoreWeave prepares to unveil its earnings report, the echoes of Google’s historic IPO and the robust institutional backing paint an optimistic picture for this AI cloud-computing pioneer.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:2452d0f2e094b:0-coreweave-riding-the-ai-wave-ahead-of-earnings/

BIG MONEY POLL — Barron's,1746235800000,"Thirty-two percent of respondents are bearish on the outlook for stocks over the next 12 months, the highest percentage since at least 1997. On the other hand, nearly 75% of the survey participants say their weighting in fixed-income assets is higher than six months ago, and 70% say they are bullish on bonds. By Paul R. La MonicaAmerica's money managers are more bearish today than they have been in nearly 30 years. Barron's latest Big Money poll of professional investors finds 32% of respondents bearish on the outlook for stocks over the next 12 months — the highest percentage since at least 1997.Just think about all the crises investors have weathered since then: the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the 2008-09 financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic. And yet the Big Money pros are more anxious now than during any of those painful points for the financial markets, the economy, and the country.The bulls' ranks also stand at historic levels in our spring survey — historically low, that is. Just 26% of respondents call themselves bullish on the market's prospects, the smallest percentage since 1997.A full 50% of managers were bullish last fall, while only 18% were bearish. The change in sentiment largely reflects worries about the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on corporate earnings and the economy. Although President Donald Trump has softened his stance since announcing tariff hikes on April 2, and has shown a willingness to make deals with both traditional allies and China, the managers remain concerned about the possibility of a global trade war.""Trump may have overplayed his hand on tariffs,"" says Harris Nydick, managing member and co-founder of CFS Investment Advisory Services in Totowa, N.J. ""This is one of the top five times in my career for fog and murkiness. There are so many unknowns.""The S&P 500 index has fallen about 4% this year after two years of double-digit gains. Tariff worries are only partly to blame, however. Equity valuations were unsustainably high at the start of the year, and investors' concentrated bets on beneficiaries of artificial-intelligence technology were rocked in late January when China's DeepSeek revealed an AI model built more efficiently, and at far lower cost, than U.S. models.Although stocks have rebounded from the lows reached after Trump's tariff announcement, the Big Money managers think more selling may be in store. Some 58% say the stock market is overvalued, while 38% call stocks fairly priced. Only 4% say the market is undervalued.The managers' clients are even more pessimistic than the pros; 56% say their clients are bearish.Bill Smead, founder and chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management in Phoenix, calls this ""one of the craziest junctures for the markets"" that he has ever seen. ""We needed to unwind growth-stock mania, "" he says, but adds that the tariff news led investors to ""slaughter things that should do better,"" namely industrial and consumer stocks that have been hit hard by trade-war concerns.Barron's conducts the Big Money poll twice a year, in the spring and fall, with the help of Erdos Media Research in Ramsey, N.J. The latest poll was mailed out in late March, with supplementary tariff-related questions added in early April. The spring survey drew 119 respondents.The optimists expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to end the year about 4% to 7% above recent levels, based on their mean forecasts. But the bears see a 7% decline for the Dow and low-double-digit losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Forty-two percent of respondents describe themselves as neutral in the latest poll.Only 20% of Big Money managers indicate they approve of Team Trump's tariff policy, while about 80% put the odds of a tariff-related recession at 40% or higher. Still, 60% consider the market's tariff-related tempest a buying opportunity.Several respondents lamented the fact that the White House isn't focusing on policies that might spur more immediate growth. ""I hope the administration begins to take a look at the process of deregulation,"" says John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, based in New York.He isn't alone: 38% of poll respondents say deregulation ought to be the administration's top economic priority this year.Simply put, much of the optimism about a second Trump administration unleashing animal spirits on Wall Street has evaporated since stocks surged shortly after Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in November.""Companies are frozen; CEOs are wondering if they should play the long game or short game,"" says Matthew Neyland, chief investment officer at SK Wealth Management in Providence, R.I. ""There are things that could be done to make the mergers and acquisitions process easier that would help.""Neyland says banks might be willing to lend more if they had more flexibility with regard to capital requirements. At the same time, ""burdensome reporting"" regulations make it more complicated for public companies to do business and have led more companies to stay private, he says.Deregulation and tax-cut extensions may be coming, but Trump has given the market ""the spinach first,"" says Eric Green, chief investment officer at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia. Green says he expects ""more shoes to drop"" before the market selloff is over.He also expects a rebound in M&A activity, but notes that companies don't want to announce major transactions until there is more clarity about tariffs. ""They've been overwhelmed by tariffs,"" he says of the White House and Congress. ""Everything else might be happening, but slowly. It's a matter of time.""What is the biggest risk the stock market will face in the next six months? Among survey respondents, 24% cite an economic slowdown, 19% say a recession, and 14% say political turmoil in the U.S. Carter Randolph, CEO of the Randolph Company in Cincinnati, is the sole poll participant who sees no chance of a recession in the next year. Although investor and business sentiment hasn't been good, consumer spending has held up, he says, adding that ""sentiment isn't a good investment tool.""But others aren't as dismissive of widespread worry on Wall Street and Main Street. Joe Gilbert, a portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management in Rocky River, Ohio, says the economy looks to be headed toward a downturn. ""Tariffs have caused things to come to a standstill,"" he says. ""It makes it tough to have confidence, and confidence is fuel for the economy, so a recession is more likely than not.""The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Wednesday that gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, fell at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, largely due to a surge in imports ahead of the implementation of tariffs. Real GDP grew 2.4% in last year's fourth quarter.Economic concerns are a big reason for gold's record-breaking rally this year. Bullion has gained almost 27% year to date, to a recent $3,312 an ounce. Gold is often viewed as a defensive holding, a commodity with currency-like qualities that performs well when the dollar is weakening. The Big Money managers are fans: 58% say they are bullish on gold.Oppenheimer's Stoltzfus says he thinks it's fine for investors to own a little gold, noting the price has gotten a boost largely due to buying by the central banks of China, India, and other emerging markets seeking to diversify beyond the dollar. But Tom Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, says gold miners might be a better play.Forester's fund owns Agnico Eagle Mines and Alamos Gold. Both are trading below their five-year average forward price/earnings multiples, he says, and are benefiting from lower oil prices, which reduces costs. Both are Canadian companies.Many Big Money participants say they are looking beyond the U.S. for better values this year, with 70% calling themselves bullish on non-U. S. stocks. Charles Zhang, founder and president of Zhang Financial in Portage, Mich., tells Barron's that he likes both developed and emerging market stocks, and favors the iShares MSCI EAFE Value exchange-traded fund and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF. ""The U.S. dollar is weaker; that and a stronger euro are helping international stocks,"" he says.Zhang, No. 1 in the Barron's ranking of independent advisors , also sees potential for Chinese stocks to keep rising, noting that Alibaba Group Holding and other leading Chinese stocks still look reasonably priced. Alibaba is up more than 40% year to date but trades for just 13 times the next 12 months' expected earnings.Better prices elsewhere, coupled with frustration about U.S. trade policies, have led some investors to throw in the towel on U.S. assets. ""Some clients are apoplectic,"" says Sandra S. Martin, managing director of Martin Investment Management, which has offices in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and Evanston, Ill. She says some of the firm's Asian clients are now focusing more on international stocks.It isn't all doom and gloom in the investment world. A volatile start to 2025 has created better buying opportunities in some stocks that had become too rich. ""The average investor needs to think for the long term, "" says Joseph Parnes, president of Technomart Investment Advisors in Baltimore. He calls himself a contrarian, and bullish. ""You should take advantage of downturns, and within two to three years we should see solid growth,"" he says.Sharon Hill, a senior portfolio manager at Vanguard, likes dividend-paying stocks, particularly in the banking and pharmaceutical industries, and especially as bond yields retreat. ""High-yielding stocks are already more attractive as a safety play,"" Hill says.She expects volatility in the bond market to make them even more so.Many Big Money men and women are upbeat about the outlook for bonds. Nearly 75% of the survey participants say their weighting in fixed-income assets is higher than six months ago, while 70% say they are bullish on bonds. ""There is still value in bonds,"" says Erica Snyder, CEO of Hunter Associates, with offices in Pittsburgh and Salem, Ohio. ""We see the Federal Reserve stepping in to cut interest rates a little bit a few times this summer.""Rate cuts could put more downward pressure on the 10-year Treasury yield, which has fallen in recent months to a current 4.17%. Sixty-two percent of Big Money respondents expect the 10-year yield to be 4% or lower a year from now.Lower bond yields are a boon to risk assets, prominently including equities. Jose Medeiros, a managing partner at Stonerise Capital Partners in San Francisco, likes the prospects for Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Alphabet. ""Tech isn't a fad; it is a growing part of the global economy, and that isn't going to change,"" he says. ""Tech companies are growing earnings at a much faster rate than the broader market, with much higher margins and better cash-flow generation. Tech stocks should trade at higher multiples on that alone.""John Maffei, chief investment officer at MFM Capital Management in Orlando, Fla., says he has been ""looking to scoop up values,"" particularly dividend payers, as the market has fallen. ""The selloff in some stocks has been overdone with this market volatility,"" he says, adding that his clients aren't panicking.Still, 2025 is likely to remain a year of surprises. And if subsequent quarters mirror the first, investors could be in for a tumultuous ride. ""It is a difficult market,"" says Ken Laudan, manager of the Buffalo Blue Chip Growth fund. ""You have to be comfortable being very uncomfortable.""If the Big Money managers are preparing for more market turbulence, the rest of us should be, too.Write to Paul R.

Review & Preview: How Coke Beat Pepsi — Barron's,1746235800000,"By Evie LiuCoca-Cola and PepsiCo shares have been on different paths this year. Coke is up 15%, easily beating the S&P 500's 2.9% decline, while Pepsi is down 12%. That is counterintuitive because, while rivals, they are often lumped together.Coca-Cola beat expectations on first-quarter earnings and revenue this past week. ""Earnings season has given investors little to get excited about,"" says Kevin Grundy, senior research analyst at BNP Paribas Exane. ""In contrast, Coca-Cola continues to hit on all cylinders and stands out fundamentally within the group."" Coke shares are Grundy's top pick. The stock is trading at 25 times earnings expected for the next 12 months, making it only 15% more expensive than its peers in packaged food and beverages. Grundy thinks Coke can ""trade at a wider premium.""Coca-Cola is primarily a soda company, though it also sells juice, milk, coffee, and tea. While Pepsi is best known for soft drinks, it has a big presence in snack food, from Lay's chips to Quaker oatmeal. Pepsi has been under pressure as consumers snack less or shift to healthier alternatives, says RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi. Coca-Cola soda sales, meanwhile, haven't been affected much by recession fears and weight-management drugs.The two also have different international exposure: The U.S. makes up 40% of Coca-Cola revenue, 60% for Pepsi. That means Pepsi is more at risk if U.S. consumer spending weakens.Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsIt was the week that marked President Donald Trump's first 100 days.

"Is META Stock's 24.18X PE Still Worth it? Buy, Sell, or Hold?",1747153140000,"Meta Platforms META shares are trading at a premium as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E), META is trading at 24.18X, a premium compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 23.72X. Meta Platforms shares are trading at a premium compared to its closest peer in the digital advertising domain, Alphabet GOOGL, but at a discount compared with Amazon AMZN. In terms of the forward 12-month P/E, Alphabet shares are trading at 16.26X, while Amazon is trading at 31.44X. Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to absorb roughly 50% of the projected global ad spending by 2028.P/E Ratio (F12M)Although higher tariffs and a prolonged trade war have the potential to hurt digital advertising spending, negatively impacting prospects, we believe Meta Platforms’ AI focus is a key catalyst. Meta Platforms’ focus on leveraging AI to improve user engagement is noteworthy. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.43 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, with roughly one billion monthly users globally. The company’s initiative to add updates that will help Meta AI deliver more personalized and relevant responses is expected to boost engagement. Amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment, Meta Platforms shares have appreciated 9.2% year to date, outperforming the broader sector as well as peers, including Alphabet and Amazon, shares of which have dropped 4.9% and 16.3%, respectively.META Stock’s PerformanceMETA shares are trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.META Shares Trade Above 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs  META Leverages AI to Boost Advertising RevenuesMeta Platforms focuses on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA NVDA. The deployment of META’s deep neural network on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip across Instagram and Facebook applications has achieved more than 6% recall improvement to the retrieval system while delivering over 8% ad quality improvement on selected segments. Meta Platforms’ focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI’s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that was used on Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META’s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months. META’s growing focus on social commerce through Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is noteworthy. In first-quarter 2025, WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions contributed to deliver 34% year-over-year growth in Family of Apps other revenues, reaching $510 million.META’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward MovementThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.84 per share, up by 3.2% over the past 30 days, indicating a 13.18% year-over-year increase.META’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.30%. Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and Consensus Meta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote Here’s Why You Should Hold META Stock Right NowAI usage is making META a popular name among advertisers as well as users.However, operating expenses are expected in the $114-$119 billion range, with headcount expected to increase within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, Generative AI, regulations and compliance. Regulatory concerns in the United States and Europe, along with tariffs, make the stock a risky bet.META is spending heavily on expanding AI infrastructure. For 2025, capital expenditure is expected to be between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by its Gen AI initiatives and core business. Although these investments bode well for the company’s longer-term prospects, we believe the lack of monetization of new platforms, such as Threads and Meta AI, is a concern. The company doesn’t expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. Meta Platforms plans to focus on scaling and deepening engagements for Meta AI over the next few years.META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable point to accumulate the stock.

Tech Trader: The AI Trade Is Showing New Life. Take It From Big Tech. — Barron's,1746235800000,"By Tae KimDuring a stretch of just 36 hours this past week, we learned more about the state of tech tariffs and artificial intelligence than perhaps we had in all three months prior. That's thanks to a quick succession of earnings from Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com.While all four companies reported better-than-expected earnings, the stock reactions following their results underscored that, in a global trade war, digital bits win over atoms. Shares of Microsoft and Meta Platforms both surged following their results, while Apple and Amazon underperformed.Apple CEO Tim Cook said tariffs would add about $900 million to the company's costs for the June quarter. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company had yet to see significant impact from the levies.That said, both Apple and Amazon sell many physical products and couldn't give much clarity about the potential tariff impact for the rest of the year.Beyond tariffs, the reports offered an important update on artificial intelligence: The reports of its demise have been greatly exaggerated.Heading into earnings season, some on Wall Street were worried that companies would reduce their plans to spend hundreds of billions to build out AI infrastructure this year. Concern about return on investment, combined with economic weakness, led some to think the big AI spending trend was done. Not even close.In fact, spending is actually picking up. The fundamental story around AI hasn't changed. AI demand continues to accelerate beyond expectations. And the so-called hyperscalers all still plan to invest aggressively.On Wednesday, Microsoft said it was increasing European data center capacity by 40% over the next two years, putting to bed speculation that the software giant was cutting back overseas. The company also reaffirmed its prior guidance to spend $80 billion on data center capacity this fiscal year ending in June.Microsoft said it has been capacity-constrained for Azure AI services, meaning the company doesn't have enough AI GPU servers to meet demand. Microsoft said it would remain supply-constrained beyond June, which is longer than management expected. That is clear evidence of robust AI demand from enterprises.In the biggest surprise of the week, Meta went a step further than Microsoft and boosted its already hefty 2025 capital expenditures forecast to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion versus a prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion. And that still may not be enough.Even with its increase in AI computing capacity, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company doesn't have the resources to meet the demand of its internal AI projects.On the earnings call with investors, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out a clear vision for five areas where he sees big opportunity for AI: improved advertising outcomes; new types of interactive content; a WhatsApp for customer support and sales; voice conversation and more personalized recommendations; and, finally, better devices. Zuckerberg sees a huge number of people wearing AI-enabled glasses within five to 10 years.""We don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI,"" Zuckerberg said, using the shorthand for return on investment. ""But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.""Similarly, Amazon sees potential for AI to transform all parts of its operations. It's already using AI to improve productivity in fulfillment, e-commerce, and advertising. ""We're not dabbling here,"" Jassy said on the earnings call. ""As fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed.""Jassy said the company's AI business was growing at more than 100% year over year, a figure that would be higher with more capacity. Jassy sounded especially optimistic about the potential for AI agents, which are programs with the ability to take simple directions and complete multistep tasks.Jassy cited two start-ups using agents to code that are suddenly significant Amazon Web Services customers, the type of demand that wasn't foreseen even a few months ago.""I would say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the first inning. It is so early right now,"" Jassy said.Of course, a prolonged trade war could change everything. Sales at large technology companies would eventually be affected as consumer spending and enterprise tech budgets all deteriorate.Even then, AI might thrive. In times of uncertainty, smart companies with long-term horizons invest to gain market share. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that if there is a recession, companies would shift more investment toward AI because it's an area with the most promise and a source of potential efficiencies.Zuckerberg agrees. During downturns, ""I'm going to do things like build out even more GPU infrastructure to serve businesses and people better,"" he said in a Stratechery podcast interview this past week.AI increasingly looks like a once-in-a-generation paradigm shift for computing. Even a recession may not bring it to a halt.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250502008847:0/

GOOGL, Meta Platforms Inc. META and Microsoft Corp. MSFT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:3 Promising AI Giants with Attractive ValuationsWall Street’s high-flying northward journey from January 2023 to January 2025 was predominantly supported by an astonishing rally in the technology sector, buoyed by the explosive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI).The AI saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, “The generative AI market is poised to explode, growing to $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022.”Here we have identified three generative AI behemoths — Alphabet Inc. , Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — that look promising in the near term.Alphabet Inc.Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as the key drivers.Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN) cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft’s Azure.GOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.Vertex usage increased 20 times in 2024, with strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3 and Veo. GOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.Google Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers. Alphabet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Solid Earnings Estimate Revisions for GOOGL StockAlphabet came up with first-quarter 2025 earnings of $2.81 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.02 per share. GOOGL posted revenues of $76.49 billion for the quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%.For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $324.35 billion, suggesting an improvement of 9.9% year over year and earnings per share of $9.43, indicating an increase of 17.3% year over year. GOOGL currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 15.6%, well above the S&P 500’s long-term EPS growth rate of 12.4%.Lucrative Valuation of GOOGL SharesAlphabet currently carries a forward P/E of 16.21X for the current financial year, compared with 18.88X of the industry and 18.62X of the S&P 500. GOOGL has a return on equity of 34.54% compared with 5.39% of the industry and 16.92% of the S&P 500 Index.At present, the short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 30.4% from the last closing price of $152.75. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $160-$240. This indicates a maximum upside of 57.1% and no downside.Meta Platforms Inc.Zacks Rank #3 Meta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement with its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.META’s artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms.META has shown strong execution of its businesses as first-quarter 2025 earnings results handsomely beat both the top and bottom-line estimates. Family daily active people totaled 3.43 billion versus the average estimate of 3.38 billion.Average Revenue Per Person came in at $12.36 compared to the average estimate of $12.14. Advertising revenues were $41.39 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $40.44 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year increase of 16.2%.Meta Platforms is exploring chat experiences in WhatsApp and Messenger, visual creation tools for posts on Facebook and Instagram and ads. Gradually, META is expected to introduce AI for video and multi-modal experiences. Meta Platforms believes AI tools will improve the business messaging experience and customer support.On July 24, 2024, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA’s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms’ Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.Strong Earnings Estimate Revisions for META StockMeta Platforms came up with first-quarter 2025 earnings of $6.43 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.2%.

"Earnings Remain Resilient, but Outlook Softens",1746223740000,"The market loved the Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META results, liked parts of the Amazon AMZN report, but didn’t like the Apple AAPL numbers. With these reports, we now have Q1 results from 6 members of the ‘Magnificent 7’ group.The aggregate growth numbers for the group are impressive, but there is a considerable variance among the Mag 7 players. The year-over-year earnings growth rates range from -56.8% at Tesla, +4.8% from Apple, +42.6% from Amazon, and +46% from Alphabet.The chart below shows the group’s blended Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to what was achieved in the preceding period and what is expected in the coming three periods.The companies are sticking with their capex plans, which has remained a sticking point with market participants in recent quarters. The DeepSeek shock notwithstanding, they all see continued spending on building out their AI infrastructure as critical to their long-term competitive positioning. For some, like Alphabet’s Google search franchise, is seen as under threat in the emerging AI world, and the company remains determined to defend its territory.Amazon, the leader in the cloud space, showed decelerating growth, which they pinned on capacity constraints in its datacenter assets. Revenues in the cloud business (Amazon Web Services) were up +16.9% to $29.3 billion, just a hair below consensus estimates. This is down from +18.9% year-over-year growth in AWS revenues in the preceding period (2024 Q4) and +19.1% in the quarter before that (2024 Q3).In other words, a steady decelerating growth trend in the cloud unit’s revenues. The deceleration in Amazon’s cloud revenues was expected and also in line with what we had seen from Alphabet. Revenue growth trends for Microsoft’s cloud business were much better compared to what we saw from Alphabet and Amazon.We suspect that some in the market had been hoping that Amazon’s cloud revenues would show the type of growth momentum that we saw from Microsoft. Amazon’s cloud numbers aren’t bad, but they aren’t great.Amazon’s modestly lowered Q2 earnings guidance wasn’t tariffs-related, but rather a function of the timing of certain operating expenses. The company’s revenue guidance aligned with consensus expectations, spotlighting the resilience of the company’s business model in this challenging operating environment. This is particularly so on the retail side, where roughly half of the sellers on the site are based in China, and even the other half that are domestically based source a significant proportion of their inventory from that market. Looked at this way, Amazon’s Q2 guidance is fairly reassuring.Of these Mag 7 players, Apple had the most pronounced tariff impact, with June quarter gross margins impacted by about 100 basis points. Given the all-around uncertainty, the company didn’t provide a lot of color on the period. For the March period, Apple’s earnings increased +4.8% on +5.1% higher revenues.The chart below shows the performance of Microsoft (up +5.3%), Meta (down -14.5%), Amazon (down -16%) and Apple (down -16.1%) relative to the Zacks Tech sector (down -12.3%) and the S&P 500 index (down -9.1%).Apple’s underperformance has more to do with its China exposure than anything else. The company has good plans in place to shift iPhone assembly to India, particularly for shipments to the U.S. market. But the stock’s performance suggests that the market remains skeptical of the plan’s success.The other aspect of the company’s exposure to China is the market’s position as a significant contributor to revenues and earnings. To that end, Apple is not only faced with regular competitive pressures from local rivals, but also has to contend with its status as an American consumer brand in a Chinese environment when local consumers may be less inclined to patronize it on nationalist grounds.The chart below shows the Mag 7 group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Please note that estimates for the Mag 7 group have started coming under pressure lately after remaining very strong over the last two years. The better-than-expected Q1 earnings results have helped reverse this negative trend, at least for now. Today's +11% earnings growth expected this year is up from +9.9% earnings growth expected last week, but down from +15.7% that was expected three months ago.The chart below of aggregate full-year 2025 dollar earnings shows how this aggregate total has evolved over the past six to seven months.Please note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 23.9% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2025, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 18.3% in 2023. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 30.6% weight in the index. If this group of mega-cap companies was a stand-alone sector, it would be the second biggest in the S&P 500 index, just behind the Technology sector at 38.7% and above the Finance sector at 13.5%.Key Earnings Reports This Week We have over 1300 companies on deck to report results this coming week, including 94 S&P 500 members.The bellwethers reporting this week range from Ford, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Uber, DoorDash, and many others. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q1 results from more than 90% of the index’s total membership.Q1 Earnings ScorecardThrough Friday, May 2nd, we have seen Q1 results from 358 S&P 500 members or 71.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these 358 index members are up +13.4% from the same period last year on +4.3% revenue gains, with 72.6% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 60.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 earnings and revenue growth rates for these index members in a historical context.The comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.As you can see here, the EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 72.6% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78.8% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The revenue beats percentage is also tracking below the 20-quarter average, but by a larger amount.Estimates Come Under PressureLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 358 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +11.6% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period.The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for 2025 Q1 in the context of where growth has been over the preceding four quarters and what is currently expected for the following three quarters.We noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further as companies report results and talk up the extent of uncertainty around their near-term business outlook.Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. The ongoing market weakness is essentially a reflection of these diminished earnings expectations. The chart below shows how expectations for the current period have evolved since the start of the year.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.Estimates for full-year 2025 have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the negative revisions trend becoming very meaningful and widespread since mid-February 2025.Estimates have been cut for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Aerospace and Construction as the only sectors enjoying modest positive revisions since mid-February. Sectors suffering the biggest cuts to estimates since mid-February include Transportation, Energy, Autos, Basic Materials, Tech, Finance, and others.The chart below shows how full-year 2025 earnings growth expectations have evolved in recent weeks.For more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Earnings Expectations Shift Lower: A Closer LookThis article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:c2958d3d8094b:0-earnings-remain-resilient-but-outlook-softens/
Tap Mag-7 ETFs on Temporary US-China Trade Truce,1747133160000,"The group of tech giants — Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta  META — known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" has been battered by the tariff turmoil.  Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF  MAGS has lost 6.4% so far this year (as of May 12, 2025) against a loss of 0.3% seen in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.The latest U.S.-China temporary trade truce came as a surprising relief to the space. Responding to the trade deal, MAGS ETF surged 5.8% on May 12. The ETF has, in fact, surged 12.9% over the past month.The recent rebound follows a rough period for Big Tech after President Donald Trump announced a ""reciprocal tariff"" plan on April 2, which wiped out $2 trillion in cumulative market cap from the Magnificent Seven.Mag-7 Stock Performance Highlights Post US-China Trade TruceAmazon and Meta Platforms spearheaded a significant rally among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks on May 12 afternoon, following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China.Stock Performance Highlights Amazon surged 8.1% and Meta climbed 7.9% on May 12. Tesla gained 6.8%, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion. Apple rose 6.3%. NVIDIA jumped 5.4%. Google shares increased 3.4%. Microsoft added 2.4%.Trade Truce DetailsThe United States agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on Chinese imports. The United States cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered American levies from 125% to 10%.These reductions will last 90 days, following two days of high-stakes talks between the two nations. The new tariffs on small packages sent from China worth up to $800 have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement.Bullish Outlook for Tech SectorThe trade development is highly optimistic for tech stocks, particularly due to the easing of supply-chain concerns. Along with Apple, Tesla is also heavily dependent on Chinese parts and battery suppliers. No wonder, both shares surged. Moreover, Tesla is expected to debut its self-driving Taxi in June.Impact of China on Big TechAmazon : 30% of product value on its platform comes from China; Chinese advertisers made up 14% of ad revenues in 2024, per Raymond James, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Meta : Chinese advertisers contributed roughly 11% of total ad spending, Raymon James noted.Google : Chinese advertisers accounted for about 6% of ad revenues, Raymon James indicated.Apple : 90% of iPhones are manufactured in China, representing 17% of 2024 revenues .NVIDIA : Chinese clients make up between 20% and 40% of the company’s end customer base, according to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Any Wall of Worry?Despite the temporary truce, the United States has imposed export bans on NVIDIA’s H20 AI chips to China, which has pressured NVDA shares. Hence, many are of the view that the phase of group-wide Mag-7 rallies appears to be over, replaced by a more scrutinized stock selection. However, no one still underrates the opportunities in the Mag-7 group.ETF PicksAnd if you want to go for group-wide picks, you have options like MAGS,  Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF  MGK,  Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF  XLG and  iShares S&P 100 ETF  OEF to play on.Meta-heavy ETFs like Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF  FCOM can be played for specific stock preference. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY invests about 35% of its basket in Amazon and Tesla.While tensions are still present around chip restrictions (H20/NVDA), the stock cannot be ignored due to continued chip demand. So, keep a close look at the NVDA-heavy Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF  SHOC.And if you like the resilience in MSFT shares and the recent rebound in the Apple stock, you can tap iShares Global Tech ETF IXN.

Google’s smart glasses bet with Warby Parker could also benefit this other eyewear maker,1747834192000,"Google’s renewed push into the smart glasses market through new partnerships with Warby Parker and luxury fashion group Kering will also benefit EssilorLuxottica- the company behind Ray-Ban smart glasses made with Meta- and accelerate the broad adoption of smart glasses, analysts say. Both Warby Parker and Kering, in separate announcements on Tuesday, said they are working with Google to develop glasses embedded with artificial intelligence, using Android XR, a version of the Android operating system tailored for headsets and glasses.The collaboration with Warby Parker is particularly significant as Google is investing up to $75 million in the company’s product development and commercialization costs.The companies plan to unveil their first product line after 2025, with a series of offerings expected to follow.The two partnerships signal Google’s broader strategy to re-enter a market it helped pioneer, but exited early. Google Glass was once at the forefront of wearable innovation but was eventually shelved due to privacy concerns and tepid consumer interest.Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba described the Google-Warby partnership as a “dream scenario” and predicted rapid expansion of the smart glasses category. “We expect smartglasses growth to be exponential over the next few years, particularly given the product is squarely at the intersection of wearable technology and AI,” he wrote.Deal could accelerate adoption of smart glassesInvestor response to the announcements was swift. Warby Parker shares closed up 16% at $20.34 on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism that the collaboration could mark a turning point for the company’s growth. Shares of Innovative Eyewear, a smaller smart glasses maker, rose 12% to $3.02. Meanwhile, Vuzix, another competitor in the space, fell 3% to $2.46.Jefferies analysts said Google’s partnership with both Warby Parker and Kering to develop artificial intelligence-powered glasses could help accelerate the adoption of smart glasses.They said that Warby Parker is less influential than EssilorLuxottica, the eyewear which with its partner Meta, leads the smartglasses category.“However, seeing established companies work on smart glasses suggests they might become mainstream soon,” they add. Deal validates the success of EssilorLuxottica and Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glassesThe renewed interest in smart glasses comes as demand for AI-integrated wearables appears to be rising. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently reported a surge in demand for Ray-Ban smart glasses, with 2 million units sold by the end of 2024. A new model is expected to launch later this year.Equita Sim analyst Domenico Ghilotti said EssilorLuxottica should benefit from Google’s partnership as the move validates the success of Meta and EssilorLuxottica’s offering and underlines the growing importance of smart eyewear as a channel for deploying consumer AI. “The deal signals the expected reaction of players like Google to the commercial success of Ray-Ban smart glasses, which EssilorLuxottica develops with Meta Platforms,” Ghilotti says. It marks “a confirmation of the growing relevance of this product for the penetration of AI solutions,” the analyst adds.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:b340422be094b:0-google-s-smart-glasses-bet-with-warby-parker-could-also-benefit-this-other-eyewear-maker/
"The Score: Meta Platforms, McDonald's, Kohl's and More Stocks That Defined the Week — WSJ",1746220380000,"By Francesca FontanaThe Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them.Meta PlatformsSeveral ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants posted earnings — which lived up to the hype?Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results that reassured investors and boosted markets.Meta said growth would remain steady, assuaging concerns that tariffs would hurt the social-media company's digital-ads business. Microsoft indicated that big corporate clients aren't slashing their technology budgets just yet.Meta shares gained 4.2% Thursday, while Microsoft shares jumped 7.6%.The tech optimism faded after Apple and Amazon.com's quarterly reports Thursday.The iPhone maker's sales rose, but it said current tariff plans would add $900 million to costs this quarter. Amazon predicted a solid quarter, but the lower ends of its forecasts missed analysts expectations.On Friday, Amazon shares edged 0.1% lower, and Apple shares fell 3.7%.NvidiaThe U.S.-China chipmaking rivalry is heating up.Huawei Technologies is gearing up to test the Ascend 910D, its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, The Wall Street Journal reported.The Chinese company hopes the latest iteration of its Ascend AI chips will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, a popular chip used for AI training that was released in 2022.Washington has attempted to block Beijing, including cutting off access to some Western chip-making equipment. Huawei, which has emerged as China's champion in the field, has been on a U.S. trade blacklist for nearly six years.Nvidia shares fell 2.1% Monday.United Parcel ServiceUPS is slashing costs and shrinking its workforce.The package giant said it would cut 20,000 operational jobs this year, and it expects to close 73 leased and owned buildings this year.The moves come after UPS in January decided to reduce the amount of packages it delivers for Amazon.com, its biggest customer.Chief Executive Carol Tomé said the cost-cutting was timely, given uncertainty around tariffs.Last year, UPS — which has nearly 490,000 employees — closed 11 buildings and cut 12,000 jobs. About 330,000 of its workers are represented by the Teamsters.After edging 0.4% lower Tuesday, UPS shares declined 1.5% Wednesday.Kohl'sKohl's fired its chief executive for cause over deals he made with his lover, The Wall Street Journal reported.The c-suite shake-up came after the retailer discovered CEO Ashley Buchanan had instructed the company to enter into a ""highly unusual"" business deal involving Chandra Holt, according to people familiar with the situation. The pair currently live together in an upscale golf community in the suburbs of Dallas.Kohl's said Buchanan didn't disclose the relationship as required by its code of ethics. Buchanan will forfeit all equity awards from Kohl's and be required to reimburse the company on a prorated basis a signing bonus worth $2.5 million.Kohl's shares gained 7.6% Thursday.McDonald'sThe ""Golden Arches"" lost some luster as Americans cut back on spending.McDonald's posted a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue, driven in part by fewer guests visiting the fast-food chain's U.S. locations.Low-income consumers particularly reduced their budgets, but so did middle-income households, McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski told investors on a Thursday conference call. Higher-income consumers maintained their visits, illustrating the ""divided U.S. economy,"" he saidAs consumer spending slows, a number of restaurants have reported falling sales, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Domino's Pizza, and Starbucks.McDonald's shares fell 1.9% Thursday.BlockFintech company Block cut its annual guidance, flagging a ""pronounced shift"" in consumer spending.Block — the parent of platforms Cash App and Square — missed quarterly profit forecasts and said users of its Cash App Card had cut back on nonessentials like travel and media. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said the consumer behavior changes drove the majority of the miss.The company is now anticipating 12% growth in gross profit year over year — down from 15% — and expects 9.5% growth in gross profit to $2.45 billion for the second quarter.Dorsey believes Cash App's gross profit growth, and Block overall, will accelerate starting in the third quarter.Block shares plummeted 20% Friday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.43 billion people daily. Meta Platforms’ growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers. This is expected to drive top-line growth. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>> )Shares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past year (+34.9% vs. +23.5%). The company’s first-quarter 2025 results reflected solid capital markets performance and loan demand. Business expansion efforts, decent loan demand and higher rates support net interest income (NII). We expect NII (managed) to show a CAGR of 3% by 2027. While a solid resurgence in deal-making activities is likely to take time, a solid pipeline will drive the Investment Banking (IB) business. We expect IB fees to witness a CAGR of 2.1% by 2027. Yet the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will hurt fee income growth. The Zacks analyst estimate for the metric shows a 6.2% fall in 2025. As it invests in technology and marketing, expenses are expected to remain high. Our estimates for non-interest expenses imply a CAGR of 2.9% by 2027. Weak asset quality is a concern.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>> )Intercontinental Exchange’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry over the year-to-date period (+16.3% vs. +13.6%). The company’s top line benefits from its compelling product and service portfolio, the broad range of risk management services and strength in global data services. Continued strength in its energy franchise and improving recurring market data revenues are likely to keep growth on track. Strategic buyouts help it achieve cost synergies that are in sync with its aim of generating long-term value for shareholders. It is well-poised for growth due to accelerated digitization in the U.S. residential mortgage industry. Intercontinental Exchange also engages in the effective deployment of capital. However, expenses are likely to remain high in the near term. Foreign currency fluctuations and stricter regulations raise concerns.

Meta Shares Rise as Tariff Overhang Clears for Asia-Based Advertisers — WSJ,1747088280000,"By Meghan BobrowskyMeta's stock had a good day.Shares of the Facebook parent closed up nearly 8% after President Trump said the U.S. and China reached a deal to temporarily roll back tariffs. The social-media giant's chief financial officer said last month that the company had seen reduced ad spending from Asia-based e-commerce retailers in April. More than 10% of Meta's revenue came from China in 2024.Mark Mahaney, head of Evercore ISI's Internet research team, said the stock was up because uncertainty with its China business was the main tariff concern the company mentioned on its most recent earnings call.""The only area of weakness they called out was China-based advertisers,"" he said.The de minimus loophole--an exemption that previously waived tariffs on packages coming into the U.S. whose goods were valued at $800 or less--was closed earlier this month and remains closed. Retailers in China had previously taken advantage of the loophole.It is unclear how the closing of the loophole has affected or will continue to affect Meta's business.This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

"U.S., Chinese Markets Cruise on Cooling Trade Tensions",1747087260000,"Monday, May 12, 2025Markets posted one of its strongest sessions of 2025 so far. We’ve had a volatile first half of the year, and we might expect that volatility to continue. But with all the ups and downs, today’s big day into the green has brought the S&P 500 within 5% of its all-time trading high. The Dow and S&P 500 are within 1% of posting profits year to date.The Dow shot up 1160 points today, for a +2.81% gain — and it was the laggard among the major indexes. The S&P 500 grew +184 points, +3.26%. The Nasdaq, which one the day on strength in tech stocks, was up a whopping +779 points, +4.35%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained +68 points, +3.40%.Of course, the catalyst for this seismic shift comes from the agreement between the U.S. and China to pause their reciprocal tariffs (which had ballooned to +145% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and +125% on U.S. exports to China). Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META were both up +8% today, leading the way for “Mag 7” stocks.Chinese stocks also saw a bounce today, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining +3% today, for its best trading day since March. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar is back up to its one-month high, and Gold — which had been a demonstrative hedge when the equities market was melting away, just a few short weeks ago — is down -3% today.What to Expect from the Stock Market TomorrowThe big news tomorrow — though unlikely to make as big a splash as this tariff pause did today — is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for April. Headline month over month CPI is expected to provide the biggest swing: +0.2% versus -0.1% reported a month ago, +0.3% on core versus +0.1% for March. Year over year, headline is expected to remain steady at +2.4%, and steady at +2.8% on core year over year.These figures, should they come in as expected, would still be notably above the optimal levels the Fed targets for inflation. Market strength and an absence of economic troubles that harsh tariff policies set in motion will likely keep any interest rate cuts at bay for now anyway, with the probability of a June rate cut tumbling from 64.4% to 8.1% today. The highest probability for the first cut of 2025 is currently the September meeting. Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Google Showcased Its Latest Tech. Why AI Is All That Matters for Alphabet Stock. — Barrons.com,1747825020000,"Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works — camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI — as an alternative portal to the web — is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem — how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the ""AI Ultra"" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was ""not budging,"" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - ""We're in center position,"" Daly said. ""My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in."" - ""I am a person of action,"" Hammack said. ""But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands."" Bostic was more definitive. ""I don't have a recession in my outlook,"" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. ""I think I've done enough,"" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has ""already turned around,"" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said ""I did what needed to be done.""- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to ""hang tight and hold out"" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife.

For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This ""good daughter,"" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card.

S&P 500 Posts Weekly Climb as April Jobs Top Expectations,1746218573000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.9% this week as April jobs data came in above expectations. The market benchmark ended Friday's session at 5,686.67. The S&P slipped 0.8% in April, marking its third-consecutive monthly decline. The index is down 3.3% for the year on worries about the impacts of the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly the ongoing trade war with several countries including China. Data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed total nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000 in April, surpassing the consensus estimate compiled by Bloomberg for a 138,000 increase. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.2% in April, in line with the market view. By sector, industrials had the largest percentage increase of this week, climbing 4.3%, followed by a 4.2% rise in communication services and a 4% advance in technology. Financials and real estate were also strong, up 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. Carrier Global NYSE:CARR had the largest weekly percentage increase among industrials, climbing 19% as the company posted Q1 adjusted earnings per share and revenue above analysts' mean estimates. Carrier Global also boosted its 2025 adjusted EPS outlook and said it now sees full-year sales at the top end of its prior guidance range. In communication services, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META was the top gainer. The Facebook parent's shares rose 9.1% as the company, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter results and projected revenue growth for the ongoing three-month period on a sequential basis. Energy was the lone sector that posted a weekly decline, slipping 0.7%. The sector's drop came as crude oil futures fell on the week. Decliners included Targa Resources NYSE:TRGP , whose shares fell 8.9% as the company reported Q1 net income and revenue below consensus views. Next week's earnings calendar features Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Uber Technologies (UBER), Walt Disney (DIS), Shopify (SHOP) and ConocoPhillips (COP).

Stocks to Watch as the U.S. & China Reach a Trade Deal,1747086840000,"Stocks surged on Monday as the U.S. and China announced a deal to temporarily reduce their high reciprocal tariffs, leading to much optimism that a global economic recession may be avoided.Easing an ongoing trade war, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on China to 30% from 145%, with China reducing tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement will last 90 days, as the two sides work on building a sustainable, long-term trade relationship.The S&P 500 rose +3% in today’s trading session, with the Nasdaq spiking over +4%, as investors flock to big tech stocks that had sold off during rising trade tensions.The Mag 7 At the center of what has been a historic market rebound are the mega-cap big tech stocks, with Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Tesla TSLA leading the market gains on Monday and up over +6% respectively. It’s likely that analysts may become more bullish on Apple’s short-term outlook as most of the electronic giant’s production comes from China. A continued run-up in Apple, Amazon, and Meta stock looks fundamentally plausible, but it’s noteworthy that Tesla lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on a trend of declining earnings estimate revisions. Suggesting now may be a good time to fade the rally in Tesla stock is that TSLA has spiked +25% in the last month. Furthermore, Tesla has the highest P/E valuation among the Mag 7 at 161.4X forward earnings, with Alphabet GOOGL being the cheapest at 16.2X.Nvidia NVDA and Microsoft MSFT have started to gain nice momentum as well, although the latter was only up +2% today. Still, Microsoft is the only Mag 7 stock that currently has a buy rating with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while the others all land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) outside of Tesla’s strong sell rating. This comes as fiscal 2025 EPS estimates for Microsoft are up 2% over the last 60 days, with FY26 EPS estimates up 1%. Alibaba & TencentOptimistically, Chinese tech stocks have already benefited from higher investor sentiment before the tariff truce with the U.S., as Chinese President Xi Jinping has been more supportive of their independent growth. With regulatory issues being less of a concern to investors, Alibaba BABA and Tencent TCEHY are two Chinese tech stocks to pay attention to and currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Their ADR’s (American Depository Receipts) have been two of the top performers on U.S. stock exchanges this year, with BABA soaring nearly +60% year to date and TCEHY up over +20%. The strong price performance has been due to their artificial intelligence expansion, leveraging AI to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer experience, as Alibaba has seen higher e-commerce sales, and Tencent has benefited from growth in its gaming and cloud services. Retail Stocks Outside of Amazon and Apple, retailers like Nike NKE, Starbucks SBUX, and even Walmart WMT and Target TGT rely heavily on supply chain operations from China. Nike and Starbucks also generate a significant portion of their revenue from their operations within China, which would make better trade and political relations between the U.S. and China beneficial to their outlook.Nike and Walmart stock stand out with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Starbucks and Target have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Plus, China accounted for 14% of Nike’s revenue in 2024, with $5.5 billion coming from footwear sales alone, as shown in the chart below.Image Source: StatistaEnergy & Transportation Stocks Energy and transportation stocks will also be important to watch, as they could receive a continued boost in the following weeks thanks to today’s trade agreement. While geopolitical tensions can often cause an uptick in crude oil prices, the trade war between the U.S. and China had an adverse effect in regard to how the market saw future demand for travel and other activities that require higher energy production. Crude prices were up as much as +2% to over $62 a barrel but are still down 20% in 2025.Image Source: Trading Economics Bottom Line The U.S. and China trade agreement gave the market what it was looking for, as investors now have more reassurance that the global economy will be less impacted by higher tariffs. That said, keeping an eye on the progress that is hopefully made in the next 90 days will be critical, considering the U.S. and China are the world's two largest economies.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7a4eb6869094b:0-stocks-to-watch-as-the-u-s-china-reach-a-trade-deal/
Google's Partnership to Develop Smart Glasses Could Give the Category a Boost — Market Talk,1747824180000,"Google's partnership with both Warby Parker and Kering to develop artificial intelligence-powered glasses could help accelerate the adoption of smart glasses, Jefferies analysts write in a research note. EssilorLuxottica and Meta currently lead the category with the Ray-Ban smart glasses they jointly develop, the analysts say. Warby Parker is less influential than EssilorLuxottica in the industry, they say.

Temu and Shein Will Feel 'De Minimis' Pain. So Will These U.S. Companies. — Barrons.com,1746212520000,"By Sabrina EscobarThe Trump administration finally closed the so-called de minimis loophole for Chinese imports, taking a shot at the business models of Chinese-founded retailers such as Shein and Temu.But several American firms may get caught in the crossfire.The de minimis trade ushered in a whole new economy that revolved around shipping products directly from Chinese factories to consumers, creating new freight and advertising demands that benefited a host of companies, from Big Tech to FedEx.Now the loophole has officially closed, these firms are sounding the alarm, while the likes of Shein and Temu — which is owned by PDD Holdings — are navigating a blow to their business.The De Minimis TradeDe minimis is a customs law that allows imported goods valued below $800 to enter the country without incurring duties or formal customs procedures. Companies such as Shein and Temu capitalized on the policy to ship items from abroad directly to consumers in packages that fell under the threshold, helping them sidestep tariffs and keep prices low.There were over 1.36 billion shipments coming in under the de minimis exemption in fiscal 2024, according to Customs and Border Protection. Many of those were from retailers selling direct to consumers — and the practice isn't limited to Shein and Temu. Many others have since emulated the model, including Amazon.com.Starting Friday, however, goods mailed from China or Hong Kong that previously fell under de minimis are subject to a 120% tariff, or a fee ranging from $100 to $200 per item.Analysts say the change will likely result in higher prices for Shein and Temu products in the long run as the companies recalibrate their business models. But for now, the companies seem to be searching for ways to keep prices low.Social media posts over the past few days suggested Temu had increased shipping fees to account for the tariffs. The company put up a notice that it would be adjusting prices in late April. On Friday, however, Temu told Barron's by email that its pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model and recruits U.S. sellers onto the platform.All U.S. orders are now handled by local sellers and fulfilled within the country, meaning they aren't subject to import charges, the company added. Items on Temu's website Friday now have a tag denoting their shipping origination as ""local.""Shein didn't immediately respond to Barron's request for comment, but the company has been advocating for de minimis reform and has also been trying to source products from countries other than China for several years now.Bloomberg reported earlier this week the company had hiked prices across several categories. A notice on Shein's website Friday read: ""Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You'll never have to pay extra at delivery.""The companies likely imported products to U.S. warehouses earlier this year to get ahead of the policy changes, which could give them a buffer from having to aggressively raise prices, but that could change when inventory runs out.The Other CasualtiesAlthough companies such as Shein and Temu were the main targets of the de minimis policy change, some U.S. firms are getting swept up in the drama, too.For instance, tech companies such as Amazon and Etsy will be directly affected by the changes.Amazon opened its Shein rival, Haul, last fall. Haul shipments relied on de minimis to send products to U.S. consumers straight from Amazon's Chinese warehouse. Haul considered listing tariff charges on certain products, but an Amazon spokesperson said the idea was never approved. It was definitively scrapped after the White House lambasted the move as a ""hostile and political act.""Meanwhile, Etsy said on Wednesday the majority of its gross merchandise sales comes into the U.S. under the de minimis exemption, but just 1% of products are Americans buying directly from Chinese vendors, meaning the current change ""would not have any material impact"" on its finances. A bigger challenge would be if the exemption gets removed altogether, executives said, as it could result in higher import costs and shipment backlogs.Others in Big Tech may find themselves hurting from a loss of advertising dollars from companies like Shein and Temu, which have been big spenders in recent years.The de minimis change was the only reference that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made to the recent updates to trade policy on the company's latest earnings call, foregoing any other mentions of tariffs.""We're obviously not immune to the macro environment,"" he said. ""But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers.""Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the company had seen reduced spend in advertising from Asia-based e-commerce companies in anticipation of the de minimis reform. Snap's Chief Financial Officer Derek Andersen said the company had ""heard from a subset of advertisers that their spending has been impacted by the changes to the de minimis exemption.""The airfreight market could also come under pressure as tariffs get collected, because a good chunk of growth was driven by de minimis shipments, wrote Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory group, in an April 21 note.FedEx, UPS, and DHL, three of the largest airfreight companies, haven't disclosed how much of their business is tied to de minimis, but all have hinted the changes could lead to lower shipment volumes.UPS said in its April 29 earnings call that trade policy changes had factored into its decision to refrain from providing updates on its full-year guidance, and why its second-quarter outlook was muted (the company expects average daily volume to drop 9% year over year).DHL said that while it has been working to reduce its exposure to the de minimis trade, it will likely lead to a reduction in volume that will have an impact on results.But, executives added, they aren't expecting a complete wipe out of de minimis volumes because they will likely find other channels to bring items into the U.S., such as bulk shipping.Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street Logs Best Day in More Than Four Weeks After US-China Tariff Pact,1747083713000,"Wall Street's benchmark indexes posted their biggest one-day gains in more than four weeks on Monday after the US and China agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. The Nasdaq Composite closed 4.4% higher at 18,708.3, the S&P 500 climbed 3.3% to 5,844.2, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.8% to 42,410.1. All three notched their biggest daily percentage gains since April 9. Barring utilities, all sectors ended in the green, led by consumer discretionary with a 5.7% gain. Washington and Beijing reached an agreement on a 90-day suspension of reciprocal duties following their talks in Switzerland over the weekend. The two sides had been in a trade war since President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs early last month. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday he expects to meet with Chinese officials again ""in the next few weeks"" to continue trade negotiations, CNBC reported. The tariff cuts likely take a recession ""off the table for now,"" Wedbush Securities said in a Monday client note. Oxford Economics said that ""though the pause is temporary and risks to the outlook because of tariffs remain weighted to the downside, the agreement implies less of a drag on the economy through the rest of this year from three of the four shocks hitting it.""The so-called magnificent-7 group of stocks rallied, with Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN soaring 8.1%, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META advancing 7.9%, and Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA rising 6.8%. Apple NASDAQ:AAPL rose 6.3%, while Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA jumped 5.4%. Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG and Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT also logged gains. US Treasury yields were up, with the two-year rate soaring 10.7 basis points to 4.02% and the 10-year rate adding 8.8 basis points to 4.48%. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 1.7% at $62.04 a barrel. Oil prices jumped on ""hopes of demand boost from easing tensions between the world's two largest economies,"" D.A. Davidson said. S&P 500 companies' latest quarterly results showed the pace of earnings growth slowing down compared with data from about a week ago, while revenue expansion accelerated, Oppenheimer Asset Management said. NRG Energy NYSE:NRG shares surged 26%, the top gainer on the S&P 500, after the company agreed to acquire a portfolio of power assets from LS Power Equity Advisors in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $12 billion. Harley-Davidson NYSE:HOG shares rose 5.2%. The company lowered its estimated cost from tariffs on China following the 90-day suspension agreement with the US. Newmont NYSE:NEM shares slumped 5.9%, the worst S&P 500 performer. The company late Friday said it reduced its stake in Discovery Silver. Gold was down 3.1% at $3,240.80 per troy ounce, while silver dropped 0.4% to $32.77 per ounce.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250512:A3376762:0/

At the mid-point, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 30% and a sequential decline of approximately 7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.12 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 30.11%. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 93 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The earnings estimate indicates growth of 50% on a year-over-year basis.AMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.32%. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar).Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Stock Price and EPS SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.AMD’s Data Center & Client Segment Revenues to Grow Y/YAMD’s first-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from growth in both its data center and client segments, driven by continued demand for its EPYC processors and Ryzen chips. The data center segment, in particular, has been a major contributor to AMD’s success, and the company expects this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. AMD expects the Data Center segment’s revenues to significantly increase, driven by the strong sales of its data center chips that support hyperscalers and power AI and Generative AI applications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Data Center revenues is pegged at $3.4 billion, indicating an impressive year-over-year surge of 47.5%.The company is likely to see continued growth in its client business, driven by higher demand for Ryzen processors across desktop and mobile platforms. AMD’s collaborations, such as the one with Dell Technologies DELL for Ryzen Pro processors in commercial PCs, are expected to have bolstered growth in this segment in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Client segment revenues is pegged at $2.04 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 49.3%.Weak Embedded & Gaming to Hurt AMD’s Q1 ResultsAMD’s near-term prospects suffer from weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments. On a year-over-year basis, these segments' revenues are expected to have declined.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Embedded revenues is pegged at $570 million, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming revenues is pegged at $509 million, suggesting a massive 38.1% decline.AMD Stock Underperforms Sector & IndustryAdvanced Micro Devices shares have lost 17.9% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decrease of 9% and the Zacks Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s decline of 7.2%.YTD AMD Stock PerformanceThe AMD stock is not so cheap, as its Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales, Advanced Micro Devices is currently trading at 4.68X, higher than the Computer – Integrated Systems industry’s 2.90X.Price/Sales Ratio (Forward 12 Months)AMD Benefits From Rich Partner BaseAMD benefits from a rich partner base, which includes Microsoft MSFT, Oracle, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo, Meta Platforms META and IBM having Instinct platforms in production.The demand for AI accelerators like the Instinct MI300 series, especially from hyperscalers, is expected to continue growing, further boosting data center revenues in the first quarter of 2025. In the Data Center AI business, MI300X deployment increased with cloud partners, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft, IBM, Digital Ocean and Dell Technologies, among others.Meta Platforms used MI300X to power its Llama 405B frontier model on meta.ai. It added instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads.Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services. IBM announced plans to enable MI300X on its Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications.Dell Technologies started offering MI300X as part of its AI factory solution suite. DELL is providing multiple ready-to-deploy containers through its Dell Enterprise Hub on Hugging Face.ConclusionAMD’s expanding portfolio and strategic acquisitions are expected to have improved its top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter amid weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments, and fierce competition from NVIDIA.AMD has a Growth Score of C, which makes it unattractive for growth-oriented investors. Stretched valuation is another concern.AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

Should You Hold NVIDIA Stock as Meta & Microsoft Double Down on AI?,1746212400000,"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA stock gained nearly 2.5% on Thursday, buoyed by a renewed wave of optimism from two of its largest customers, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. Both tech giants reaffirmed, and in Meta Platforms’ case, raised their capital expenditure commitments toward AI infrastructure.This resurgence of AI-related investment could mark a key turning point for NVIDIA stock, which has pulled back 27% from its 52-week high of $153.13 attained on Jan. 7, 2025. With the renewed optimism about AI investment, the question arises: Should investors rush to buy more, or is holding the stock the smarter move right now?AI Spending Spree Could Reignite Demand for NVIDIA’s ChipsMicrosoft, a major cloud provider and longtime NVIDIA partner, confirmed during its third-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call that it will maintain its massive $80 billion capital expenditure plan for AI data centers, with more than half of that directed toward U.S. operations.Meanwhile, during its first-quarter 2025 earnings call, Meta Platforms increased its 2025 capital spending outlook to a range of $64-$72 billion, up from the prior $60-$65 billion range. The added spending will primarily go toward expanding data center capacity and AI infrastructure, both heavily reliant on NVIDIA’s high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs).Meta Platforms’ CFO, Susan Li, made it clear that the CapEx bump is driven by AI ambitions and infrastructure upgrades. Similarly, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood indicated that fiscal 2026 investments will grow, albeit at a slower pace, and be more closely aligned with short-term revenue gains, implying accelerated AI workload deployments.These commitments are strong signals that NVIDIA’s chips, especially its H100 and upcoming B100 GPUs, will remain in high demand as hyperscalers scale their AI platforms.AI Boom Driving NVIDIA’s Financial PerformanceNVIDIA’s products are at the center of the ongoing AI revolution, driving demand from hyperscalers, enterprises and cutting-edge startups alike. The data center end-market continues to be a powerhouse for NVIDIA. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues from the data center end-market grew 93% year over year to $35.58 billion and contributed 90.5% to the total sales.AI-driven workloads, cloud computing expansion and increasing enterprise adoption of AI models have turned NVIDIA’s high-performance chips into a necessity rather than a luxury. With businesses aggressively investing in AI infrastructure, NVIDIA remains positioned at the heart of this technological transformation.Financially, NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenues surged 78% year over year, while non-GAAP EPS climbed 71%. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance of $43 billion in revenues represents a staggering increase from $26.04 billion in the prior-year quarter.Analysts expect NVIDIA to maintain this momentum, forecasting fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenue growth of 48% and 24%, respectively. With earnings projected to rise 42% in fiscal 2026 and 27% in fiscal 2027, NVIDIA’s long-term investment case remains intact. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.9%.NVIDIA Corporation Stock Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNVIDIA Overvaluation Warrants a CautionValuation-wise, NVIDIA is overvalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of D.However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, NVDA shares are trading at 13.32X, higher than the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s 10.96X.Conclusion: Hold NVDA Stock for NowNVIDIA’s stock may be off its highs, but the AI megatrend is very much alive and is receiving fresh fuel from the likes of Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Their deep-pocketed commitments to AI infrastructure spending underscore NVIDIA’s strategic importance in the evolving tech landscape. However, its high valuation makes it vulnerable to short-term volatility. For now, holding the stock is the smartest approach.Currently, NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These companies are emerging as potential winners in Trump's trade war,1746205320000,"By James RogersThis earnings season, companies in some sectors have started spelling out the potential financial impact of tariffs, while others have withdrawn their outlooks citing too much uncertaintyThe fallout from President Trump's sweeping tariffs agenda is casting a long shadow over earnings season as companies wrestle with the unfolding trade war, but there are also glimmers of opportunity amid the uncertainty, according to LPL Financial.Despite the market turmoil, names in some sectors are spelling out the financial impact of tariffs, while others have pulled their guidance, saying that the economic outlook is too uncertain. A handful of names have even cited potential benefits from the tariffs climate.Set against this backdrop, Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted opportunities in a note released this week. He categorizes this current period as ""phase one,"" characterized as ""peak uncertainty and peak tariffs,"" with ""phase two"" the period ""after the tariff dust settles.""""We believe consumer staples, real estate, and gold are well positioned for the current phase of uncertainty,"" wrote Buchbinder.He acknowledged, however, that not all consumer staples companies will be immune.Domestic packaged food companies are relatively insulated thanks to specialty crops such as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados and chocolate falling within the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, he said. ""On the other hand, dollar stores and supercenters are not immune due to a reliance on goods from China and will be forced to raise prices or adjust supply chains after inventories are depleted,"" Buchbinder added.Related: GE Healthcare sees tariffs costing $500 million in 2025, then much less next yearBuchbinder said empty shelves are a real risk, and that imports of alcoholic beverages and spirits could be a point of pain. He also mentions the impact of cumulative price increases, ongoing sticky inflation and elevated consumer borrowing.""That said, given staples are more 'needs' than 'wants' and revenues typically hold up well in an economic slowdown, we'll put consumer staples in the phase-one winner category,"" he added.However, Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the parent of household brands including Pampers, Gillette, Crest and Tide, cut its earnings outlook last week amid worries about higher prices from tariffs and a slowing economy. Toothpaste and soap maker Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) also cut its guidance last week.Parts of the healthcare sector also stand to benefit from the current tariffs climate, according to LPL Financial.""It would be logical to put the defensive healthcare sector among the phase one winners, but pharmaceuticals are in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's trade policy,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""Sectoral tariffs could rattle the sector, pending successful country-level negotiations.""However, the analyst sees opportunity around medical devices. ""On the medical equipment side, tariff exposure is relatively limited, with the most exposed companies generating 12% or less of their revenue in China and most manufacturing housed in the U.S., so that group may be a phase one winner,"" he wrote.The healthcare sector has been breaking down the financial cost of tariffs in recent weeks.Medical technology company GE Healthcare Technologies Inc. (GEHC) said earlier this week that the impact of the global tariffs war will cost it around $500 million at current rates and cut its full-year profit outlook. And medical-device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT) estimated recently that tariffs will cost it ""a few hundred million dollars"" this year, but reaffirmed its full-year guidance.Related: Procter & Gamble sees consumers hit 'pause' amid tariffs, job-market uncertaintyLast week, drugmaker Merck & Co. (MRK) said that its reaffirmed 2025 outlook absorbs an estimated $200 million in additional costs for already implemented tariffs. Medical-technology and drug company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) estimated that tariffs could result in about $400 million in extra costs and raised its sales outlook.Financials are also a phase-one winner because of the sector's limited exposure to goods imports, according to LPL Financial, although cyclicality also makes them a potential winner in phase two.For phase two, LPL Financial sees the communication services sector as a potential winner, with ""honorable mentions"" for technology, consumer discretionary, and industrials.In communication services, LPL Financial points to solid first-quarter results from Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX).""The key risk, beyond regulatory pressures on the big internet companies, is that tariff rates don't come down as much as we anticipate, weighing on margins in this space, although the effects on the digital media segment of the sector are quite manageable,"" Buchbinder wrote.He believes the tech sector could easily grow earnings 20% this year as AI investment continues but says that technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. ""The sector has underperformed since July of 2024,"" wrote Buchbinder. ""We also worry about semiconductor industry disruptions from U.S.-China trade tensions,"" he added, noting that this has challenged Nvidia Corp.'s performance lately.Software appears better positioned for this environment than semiconductors, according to LPL Financial. The financial services company also notes that tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL) has significant operations in China that will not be cheap or quick to move away from.Related: Here's how GM is dealing with tariff uncertainty: pulling guidance, halting stock buybackMeanwhile, consumer discretionary, which sell what people ""want,"" is heavily impacted by the tariffs regime.""Tariffs on apparel makers, autos, and home construction materials (primarily lumber) are particularly biting, while policy uncertainty has hurt consumer confidence and contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending,"" wrote Buchbinder.On Thursday car giant General Motors Co. (GM) slashed its profit guidance and said that it expects tariffs to cost up to $5 billion.Elsewhere in consumer discretionary, Coca-Cola Co. (KO) kept its full-year profit outlook intact and described tariffs as ""manageable,"" while rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) cut its full-year outlook.Household products maker Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) said that tariffs could actually benefit its business and maintained much of its 2025 outlook. Consumer-facing washer and dryer maker Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) also said that it could be a ""winner"" under the new tariffs regime and kept its full-year guidance unchanged.However, airlines are a different story, with American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) pulling their guidance amid macroeconomic uncertainty.LPL Financial acknowledges that, while consumer discretionary is one of the sectors hardest hit by tariffs, it makes sense that it would benefit if levies come down.""But the uncertainty is still too high right now and a neutral stance seems prudent,"" Buchbinder wrote.-James RogersThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Amazon and Tech Stocks Rally. Stay Cautious. — Barrons.com,1747067160000,"By Angela Palumbo and Adam ClarkAmazon.com was leading the Magnificent Seven group of stocks on Monday as markets welcomed a truce on tariffs between the U.S. and China. Tech investors should keep in mind that there's still a long road ahead.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said early Monday that the U.S. and China have agreed to lower reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. Amazon shares were up 7.4% on the news. That outstripped gains for fellow Mag 7 members Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, which gives equal weight to the group of stocks, was up 4.9%.""With US/China clearly on an accelerated path for a broader deal we believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table in 2025 as investors will likely focus on the next steps in these trade discussions which will happen over the coming months,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Monday.It isn't hard to see why Amazon could be a beneficiary of a trade deal between the world's two largest economies. Many of the sellers on its e-commerce marketplace source their goods from China, and the reduction in tariffs will mean they can continue to do business.Amazon investors may also be breathing a sigh of relief over the possibility that spending on advertising may continue to be strong. About 30% of Amazon's first-party merchandise is sourced from China, and Chinese advertisers spent around $8 billion on Amazon advertising in 2024, according to Raymond James estimates.In recent weeks, Wall Street has been concerned that Asia-based advertisers were starting to show signs of weakness. The Trump administration removed a commonly used trade loophole called the de minimis exemption that allowed lower-cost imports to enter the U.S. without being subject to tariffs. Chinese companies, known for lower-priced items, may not want to put as much money into advertising if prices increase and consumers stop spending.If tariffs remain lower than threatened, those price increases may not emerge, and spending might not wane.In that scenario, other tech companies would also benefit. Meta and Alphabet both make a lot of money from advertising, and each of those tech giants said on their most recent earnings calls that they were starting to see Asia-based advertisers pull back on advertising. Snapchat parent Snap Inc., which makes almost all of its money from ads, withheld financial guidance in April due to economic uncertainty. That stock was up 7.3% on Monday.Before investors get too excited, it is important to remember that the news is all very fresh. It will take some time for advertisers to go back to their pre-tariff strength, and with a temporary trade deal, there is still uncertainty as to what could come next.The semiconductor industry was also performing well on Monday. Nvidia was up 3.7%, On Semiconductor was surging 9.6%, and Texas Instruments was climbing 8.4%. Wall Street was optimistic that the negotiations could lead to an outcome where electronic goods produced in China that use chips weren't taxed by the U.S. as heavily, and supply chains weren't as disrupted.However, there is more to the chip sector that investors should watch. First, the U.S. has imposed export controls on chips as it seeks to become the winner of the AI race. The Trump administration exempted semiconductors and other electronic products from the reciprocal tariffs, opting instead to target chips specifically through sector tariffs in the future.Secretary Bessent signaled those sector tariffs will still come, saying on CNBC on Monday that reciprocal tariffs have nothing to do with industry-specific tariffs for ""strategic necessities"" like semiconductors, steel, and some medicines.While the market rebounds and tech stocks soar, it's important to remember that there is much more that's likely to come in the months ahead.""This is a textbook recovery after the market's waterfall declines. Expect volatility as we approach the 90-day reciprocal tariffs deadline, "" Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote on Monday.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

The AI Diffusion Rule is Over. What That Means for Trump and China. — Barrons.com,1747747020000,"By Justin ShermanAbout the author: Justin Sherman is the founder and CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, a research and advisory firm, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.In a major trade and security pivot, President Donald Trump has scrapped his predecessor's so-called artificial intelligence diffusion rule that was set to be implemented last week. That rule, signed by President Joe Biden in his final days in office, added export controls on integrated circuits and AI models to countries such as China and Iran — with big exemptions for friendly nations such as Germany. Some U.S. AI and chip companies are cheering on this reversal, their present view reflecting that of a Commerce Department spokesperson: Biden's AI rule was ""overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation.""At face value, it seems the leading industry players and the U.S. government are on the same page: Companies want to build and sell chips and AI products globally, and the administration wants U.S. industry to boom. Both worry about Beijing's AI capabilities and threats to U.S. national security. Same talk, same page.But many chip and AI companies' talk about national security and China is more or less just that — talk. For some firms, talking about China and national security is simply a way to frame their own priorities, such as relaxing export controls or building data centers, in terms that land well with the current top policymakers. It seems like talking about Biden's diffusion rule as overly burdensome for companies — and therefore bad for national security — worked.When the rubber meets the road, however, AI and chip companies may not like the Trump administration's hawkish position on China, and the administration may not like companies' true views on national security issues. Whatever replaces the AI diffusion rule will expose those critical tensions.These commercial AI and national security concerns have been brewing under the surface for months. In 2024, many AI companies were trying to present themselves as moving in lockstep with the Biden administration vis-à-vis China. But the Biden administration's domestic work on trustworthy AI certainly caused friction with industry — particularly for those who would rather do away with safeguards. And some began whittling away at the national security narrative.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in July 2024 that closing off U.S. AI systems to China would be a mistake, as America's advantage comes from openness and fewer controls. Framed in the context of helping national security, the anti-regulatory argument spoke to a bigger policy concern: China. OpenAI, shortly thereafter, pitched the administration on a massive data center buildout, likewise framed as key to geopolitical competition. This kind of rhetoric, speaking to fears of ""falling behind"" in what many reductively call the ""AI race,"" also found a receptive audience in Washington. Biden started to put his executive order on data centers in motion.The apparent alignment between the government and commercial chip and AI firms changed with the flick of a pen. When the Biden team published the AI diffusion rule on Jan. 13, the backlash was swift from companies that were, a moment ago, speaking as if they backed the president's national security rationale.Nvidia released a statement that day calling the rule a misguided, unprecedented effort that ""threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide"" and ""squander America's hard-won technological advantage."" The rule is ""cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, "" but ""would do nothing to enhance U.S. security.""That rhetoric evidently worked on the new administration — and the benefits shortly flowed to investors. The day after Trump nixed the diffusion rule, Nvidia's stock rose 4.4%. AMD's stock rose 3.4%. But ditching Biden's order is a temporary resolve between these commercial and national security tensions, likely to be disrupted when the Trump administration rolls out the rule's replacement.A replacement program could relax chip and AI model technology exports to some countries favored by Trump, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and hugely ramp up limits for China. That will prompt industry concerns for chip companies wanting to sell in China and to maintain certain China-based supply chain points. Or a new program could soften restrictions below a certain compute or model performance threshold, but broadly curb exports of higher-end technologies in ways that impact a different vertical of industry sales.As a general rule, export restrictions focused on national security are going to both limit companies' overseas market opportunities and speak to issues that aren't companies' bread and butter. Just as some investment firms are skeptical of inbound and outbound investment screening, some leading chip and AI companies are unlikely to truly buy into the scope and degree of national security concerns about exports to China.So administration officials — particularly those most hawkish on Beijing — may find themselves in direct confrontation with chip and AI companies that are keen on continuing to sell high-end chips to Chinese buyers. The administration's concerns about AI diffusion to China through third countries may also conflict with companies that feel even countries with close ties to China aren't in fact China — and therefore aren't a risk. Officials could even encounter the same amount of pushback and criticism on a more relaxed export rule than the Biden administration faced on its more sweeping one. After all, the psychological treadmill kicks in, and even a more moderate set of rules will still raise the regulatory floor — and demand higher compliance costs and impact bottom lines.This isn't to say every chip and AI company is crying ""national security"" just to get on policymakers' calendars. Plenty of chip and AI companies build tech entirely or primarily for national security use cases. Some major AI vendors, such as Anthropic, supported the AI diffusion rule with tweaks. Last month, Anthropic said stronger export controls on chips were necessary to keep a competitive lead over China.It is healthy for commercial enterprises to have a range of views on geopolitical and national security issues, especially in a volatile global trade and geopolitical environment.But as the administration talks genuinely about the country's AI advantage over China, these tensions under the surface will bubble up again. Companies will have to navigate more uncertainty and new national security guidelines. And policymakers may have to confront public-private differences of opinion on China head-on.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Can S&P 500 ETFs Continue Their Winning Streak?,1746201600000,"After enduring a sharp downturn in early April due to aggressive U.S. tariff policies, the S&P 500 has staged a remarkable comeback. The index is on the verge of notching its longest winning streak since 2004, after registering its eighth consecutive winning session on Thursday. This underscores a renewed wave of investor confidence in the face of lingering economic uncertainty. The three ultra-popular ETFs tracking the index — Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV — gained about 6% each in the last eight days.The surge was primarily driven by strong earnings reports from major technology firms and easing concerns over trade tensions. Will the strong trend continue? Let’s delve deeper:Big Tech Earnings Lift OptimismStrong quarterly earnings reports from software giant Microsoft MSFT and Facebook parent Meta Platforms META spread strong optimism in the tech sector, the heart of the market rally last year. The dual earnings outperformance underscores that strong demand for AI is helping both companies navigate tariff-driven economic uncertainty (read: AI ETFs Set to Gain on Robust Meta, Microsoft Earnings). After the closing bell on Thursday, Amazon AMZN and Apple AAPL also announced quarterly results with the beat on both earnings and revenues. However, their shares are falling due to tariff uncertainties. Apple warned of a $900 million tariff headwind in the ongoing quarter. The good news is that Apple is shifting its assembly of all iPhones for the U.S. market to India as soon as next year. About 50% of iPhones for U.S. markets are now produced in India, while iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and other products are increasingly sourced from Vietnam.Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky issued a cautious outlook due to uncertain consumer demand in the face of President Trump's shifting tariff policies. Amazon faces significant exposure to Trump’s tariffs, primarily through its retail unit.Tariffs and Trade Deal TalksThe Trump administration seems to be softening its stance on tariffs, raising hopes of a resolution of the trade conflict. At a White House press conference last week, Trump called the current 145% reciprocal tariffs ""too high"" and said they would ""come down substantially."" Meanwhile, China is evaluating the possibility of starting trade negotiations with the United States. According to several reports, China might suspend its 125% tariff on some U.S. goods, which boosted market sentiment.Weak Economic ReadingsThe U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years due to a monumental pre-tariff import surge. GDP declined at an annualized rate of 0.3% during the first three months, more than the 0.2% decline expected by economists surveyed by BloombergU.S. manufacturing activity shrank the most since November in April. The manufacturing PMI revealed by the Institute for Supply Management dropped to a five-month low of 48.7 in April from 49.0 in March. Further, consumer confidence hit a five-year low last month. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to 86 in April, representing its lowest reading since May 2020 and the fifth consecutive decline. The decline was due to tumbling consumers’ expectations related to business conditions, employment prospects and future income, reflecting pessimism about the economy (read: Is Weak Consumer Sentiment Hurting Discretionary ETFs?). Encouraging Jobs ReportApril jobs data shows that the U.S. labor market remained resilient amid the tariff chaos. The economy added better-than-expected 177,000 jobs while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.Bottom LineWhile the current momentum is encouraging, ongoing uncertainties around trade policies and economic indicators suggest that volatility may persist.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:67d272df0094b:0-can-s-p-500-etfs-continue-their-winning-streak/
Stocks Rise Pre-Bell on US-China Trade Agreement; Investors Await Key Inflation Data,1747049962000,"The benchmark US stock measures were pointing higher before the opening bell on Monday as Washington and Beijing struck a deal to slash tariffs on each other's goods, while investors await key inflation data later in the week. The S&P 500 gained 2.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2%, and the Nasdaq climbed 3.8% in premarket activity. The S&P 500 and the Dow finished Friday's trading session in the red, while the Nasdaq Composite was little changed. The US and China on Monday agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods, effective Wednesday, following talks between officials in Switzerland over the weekend. China will reduce its tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%, while the US will lower duties on Chinese products to 30% from 145%. The new measures are effective for 90 days. ""We had very productive talks,"" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news conference, according to a CNBC report. ""We have reached an agreement on a 90-day pause and substantially move down the tariff levels.""Washington and Beijing have been engaged in a trade war after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new reciprocal tariffs on several nations on April 2. Last month, China raised its tariffs on US imports to 125% in response to Trump's move to hike duties on the Asian country's products to 145%. ""This is clearly just the start of a broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush Securities said in a Monday client note. US Treasury yields moved higher in premarket action, with the two-year rate increasing about 12 basis points to 4% and the 10-year rate gaining 7 basis points to 4.45%. With no economic reports scheduled for Monday, traders will be awaiting the consumer price index report for April on Tuesday, followed by the producer price index and the retail sales report for the same month on Thursday. Last week, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged and warned that upside risks to inflation and unemployment have increased. Fed Governor Michael Barr said Friday that the US government's trade tariffs were likely to raise inflation and unemployment, amid an expected economic slowdown. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler is scheduled to speak at 10:25 am ET. Shares of Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA jumped 7.5% pre-bell while Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA grew 4.8%.

Last quarter, Roku said it expected devices revenue to grow 12% from the previous year in 2025. On Thursday, the company said ""while tariff-related impacts to our Devices segment remain difficult to predict, we expect Devices revenue and gross profit loss to remain consistent with 2024 levels.""At the same time. President Donald Trump's tariffs have left companies unsure of what the economic environment will look like in the months to come. Roku management said on a call to discuss the results that it is starting to see advertisers shifting their budgets as a result. Other tech companies, including Snap, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, have made similar comments this earnings season.""While we remain confident in Roku's ability to create opportunities in this environment with its treasure trove of user data, uncertainty on advertising budgets could linger until tariffs are removed,"" Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a note on Friday. She rates Roku as Outperform with a $100 price target.There could be one bright spot for Roku, though. CEO Anthony Wood said on the call that advertisers have been shifting their focus to streaming channels from traditional TV""The good news for ROKU is the move to streaming is a wind at the back of results and if anything the move to streaming could accelerate in a potential weakening economy as consumers look to save money,"" Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote on Thursday.

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AI Agents Will Transform Customer Relationships, for Better or Worse — WSJ",1746878400000,"By Steven RosenbushAI agents are poised to make communication between businesses and their customers deeper, more open and more personal. That level of intimacy might be great, but as in any relationship, it creates the potential for hazard, too.The latest generation of AI agents are capable of taking action on behalf of people in a range of functions, including coding , customer service, legal services and booking an appointment with a healthcare provider. Their migration into popular messaging services such as WhatsApp opens up even more opportunities for businesses in the areas of sales, support, marketing and branding.There is a flywheel effect at work here. The AI agent has access to an enormous amount of data about users that makes it possible to tailor recommendations, information, and insights to their needs. And once they reside in a messaging app, they can create a continuing presence in the user's life, just like a person would.""Once an AI knows you and remembers your history, it stops feeling like a tool and starts to feel like a companion,"" says Conor Grennan, chief AI architect at New York University Stern School of Business. ""It starts to blur the line between an AI brand ambassador and just a friend who shares your taste.""But that is also where the potential peril lies. As AI agents become more like people, they are increasingly prone to the pitfalls of human relationships. Last year, for example, Air Canada was ordered to refund a customer after the airline's chatbot gave the wrong details about its bereavement policy. Air Canada said the technology was less sophisticated than more current AI. But it would be rash to assume that today's AI is beyond error.Consumers themselves might not trust an AI agent's answers, and could demand to speak to a human representative the way they do now when they reach automated customer-service phone lines.WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms is betting that combining AI agents and business messaging can provide a new pillar of growth.It has a lot riding on that bet. Meta, which paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014, last month raised its projected companywide capital spending for the year to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, largely on its artificial-intelligence investments.But AI chatbots could help get more businesses using the company's messaging products. It has a number of ways to cash in if they do, including the sale of ads on Instagram or Facebook that let users click to send messages over the regular WhatsApp app that they use everyday.WhatsApp created a specialized app for small businesses and an application programming interface, or API, for large businesses back in 2018, and their usage has been soaring in markets such as India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil, according to Meta's Nikila Srinivasan, vice president of product management for business messaging.Verizon began a WhatsApp campaign for Spanish-speaking customers in the U.S. last fall, according to Robyn Parks, the telecom giant's vice president of segment and local marketing. The campaign uses ads on Facebook or Instagram that give customers or potential customers the option to click to chat on WhatsApp, with an opportunity to move the communication to another channel.The company would typically expect a ""conversation start rate"" for an ad to be in the single digits. The WhatsApp campaign has been in the double digits, she said. Verizon said it also has ads on WhatsApp that direct customers to the Verizon website and app.And if a customer drops out of the conversation, Verizon can use the WhatsApp channel to try to re-engage via WhatsApp text, a process that she described as a ""warm callback."" That wouldn't be possible with advertising in a broadcast medium.""It's much more of a conversation,"" Parks said.Now imagine untold AI agents initiating those warm callbacks. It could be revolutionary — and risky for companies that don't learn to manage those agents with the same care that they manage people.Write to Steven Rosenbush at steven.rosenbush@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250510000577:0/

Infrastructure Surge to Lift Sterling Q1 Earnings: Buy or Hold?,1746198120000,"Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 5, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, Sterling delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9% and growing 13.2% year over year. Revenues grew 3% year over year to $498.8 million. Despite falling slightly short of guided revenue, the company managed to outperform in key profitability metrics, demonstrating its ongoing commitment to margin expansion. Gross margin for the quarter surpassed 21%, while adjusted EBITDA and operating income also expanded meaningfully, reinforcing the company's focus on execution and disciplined cost control.Sterling, a premier U.S. service provider specializing in transportation, civil construction, and e-infrastructure solutions, has an impressive track record of surpassing earnings expectations, exceeding the consensus mark in each of the last four quarters. The average surprise over this period is 16.2%, as shown in the chart below.How Are Estimates Placed for STRL?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter EPS has remained unchanged at $1.58 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a whopping 58% growth from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for revenues is $415.6 million, indicating a 5.6% year-over-year decline.For 2025, STRL is expected to register 34.6% EPS growth from a year ago. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)What the Zacks Model Unveils for SterlingOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Sterling for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: STRL has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Influencing Sterling’s Q1 PerformanceSterling has established itself as a major player in the booming e-infrastructure and transportation markets. The company’s strategic focus on high-margin projects, coupled with strong execution, has led to record earnings growth so far. With a robust backlog, ongoing federal infrastructure spending, and rising demand for data centers, Sterling appears well-positioned for another strong quarter.However, as is typical for Sterling, the first quarter is expected to be the company’s lowest revenue quarter of the year due to seasonal trends.Segment-wise, E-Infrastructure Solutions, STRL's largest and fastest-growing segment, accounted for 47% of fourth-quarter 2024 revenues. Its customers include Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Walmart Inc. WMT and Hyundai Motor Group. It is set to benefit from multi-year capital deployment in data centers, advanced manufacturing, and industrial sectors. Enhanced supply chain dynamics and a focus on large-scale, mission-critical projects will boost sales and margins. Data centers, now 50% of STRL’s E-Infrastructure backlog, play a crucial role in future growth, driven by the demand for AI technology advancements.Transportation Solutions segment (which accounted for 35% of total fourth-quarter 2024 revenues) is expected to benefit from strong broad-based demand and margin growth across its entire geographic footprint. The segment is expected to have benefited from robust state and local funding, the Infrastructure Bill's allocation of $643 billion for transportation programs (including $284 billion in incremental funding), and a $25 billion investment in airports over five years.Sterling’s Building Solutions segment (which accounted for 18% of total fourth-quarter 2024 revenues) is focusing on concrete foundations for residential and commercial projects. While Sterling’s overall outlook is strong, challenges persist in the residential construction market. Affordability concerns and high interest rates have kept potential homebuyers on the sidelines, limiting demand. Also, weather disruptions in Dallas and Fort Worth significantly hampered operations early in the quarter.Acquisitions have significantly contributed to STRL's growth by expanding its operations and boosting revenues. Strategic investments for profitability and efficient service execution, along with accretive buyouts, are anticipated to have driven substantial fourth-quarter growth.STRL Stock’s Price PerformanceSTRL stock has exhibited an upward movement in the past month and outperformed the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry and the broader Construction sector, as you can see below.Sterling’s 1-Month Price PerformanceSterling Stock’s 50-Day & 200-Day Moving AveragesSterling’s stock is trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). This suggests the stock has positive price momentum over both the short-to-medium term (50-day SMA) and long term (200-day SMA).Let's assess the value STRL offers to investors at its current levels. Despite the solid rally, STRL is trading slightly at a discount compared to the industry average, as shown in the chart below. The stock is trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 17.4—lower than the Zacks Engineering - R&D Services industry average of 17.73 but well above its five-year median of 11.33.Sterling’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) vs. IndustryWhy Should You Hold STRL Stock Now?As the infrastructure sector continues to grow, Sterling stands to benefit significantly due to its strong industry reputation and extensive experience with top-tier clients. The current capacity for data centers falls far short of meeting the rising demand driven by artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Sterling remains well-positioned due to its consistent earnings outperformance, strong margin execution, and exposure to growth drivers like data centers and infrastructure spending. Despite expected seasonal softness in the first quarter, full-year EPS is projected to grow more than 34% in 2025, backed by a robust backlog and strategic acquisitions.The stock’s upward momentum, trading above its 50- and 200-day moving averages, reinforces investor confidence. With a forward P/E of 17.4—slightly below the industry average—valuation remains reasonable. STRL reflects a balanced risk-reward profile at current levels.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e783aa41f094b:0-infrastructure-surge-to-lift-sterling-q1-earnings-buy-or-hold/
The Giants of Silicon Valley Are Having a Midlife Crisis Over AI — WSJ,1746869400000,"By Tim HigginsMiddle age hits hard — even for the Kings of Silicon Valley.One minute you're upending established industries as the young disrupter. The next, you're staring into the abyss, eating glass — as Elon Musk likes to say — watching the disruption at your door.Most, if not all, of the Magnificent Seven are in that position — weirdly trying at the same time to figure out the threat of artificial intelligence to their kingdoms.That dynamic has been on display the past few weeks: Alphabet's stock dropped more than 7% Wednesday after a senior Apple executive disclosed that Google search-traffic on its devices using Safari fell for the first time in 20 years. (Google later clarified it continues to see overall search growth, even from Apple devices.)For his part, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook is trying to buy time for his company, pushing investors during his latest earnings call to be patient with the iPhone maker's delays around AI features.Then there is Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg's attempt to paint a bright future for his ad-dollar juggernaut as something of an AI-buddy for the lonely.Even Musk seems to be sweating things as he returns from his DOGE sojourn to Tesla, seeking to counter a slide in the electric carmaker's stock price with promises of deploying driverless cars. ""We're not on edge of death — not even close,"" Musk told analysts recently.His protests sounded like that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" character about to be thrown on a pile of corpses: ""I'm not dead! ... I feel happy!""To be fair, none of these giants are dead — yet. And they have lots of reasons to feel happy — they are wildly profitable pillars of corporate America and together represent around $7 trillion of market value.Yet the crossroads they all stand at, collectively, and how they react, individually, look like ready-made case studies for a 21st century update of the classic business school book ""The Innovator's Dilemma.""Author Clayton Christensen tried to explain how new products or services displace existing players by creating new markets. It was a book that made the term ""disruption"" wildly popular in boardrooms — even if used in a way the late Christensen didn't always intend.The gist of his theory was that successful companies doing everything seemingly right can fail when smaller companies — not constrained by what has been — rise up, often with new technologies or processes. Think Netflix targeting through-the-mail subscribers versus Blockbuster's in-store model.Many turned to this book to explain the dot-com boom that helped usher in the current crop of Silicon Valley heroes. There are rough parallels today.Just as the internet was a new technology that could do lots of things, AI holds many promises. But in these early innings, it isn't clear how AI will be deployed — or by whom or when.Pets.com, for example, wasn't the winner many thought. That's the rub. Even Christensen had a hard time predicting disrupters, like Apple's iPhone.When the gadget came out in 2007, the Harvard professor didn't see it as a threat to phones. In fact, the device ushered in a new era of mobile computing and the App Economy.That app marketplace, however, might look a lot different if companies are reaching customers in different ways . AI agents, for example, could upend the App Store way of the world.So far, Apple's answer to AI has appeared to be heavy on the hype. ""We just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar,"" Cook told investors during Apple's recent earnings call about the delay.At least Google has an AI assistant, Gemini, though it's unclear if that chatbot will be enough to save its real business — advertising, which accounted for most of its revenue last year. That's a lot of ads sold off users clicking on links in a world where people increasingly ask a chatbot their questions, like: What is ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" about?Still, it might be surprising that no dominant platform seems to have a winning formula just yet.That gives hope to the likes of Sarah Guo, a young venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. She is trying to make her mark by investing in the next hot AI startup that might dethrone the big dogs.""There are many claims you can make strategically about why a company shouldn't exist: because Microsoft should build it or Apple should build or Google should build it,"" she told me during the recent episode of the "" Bold Names"" podcast. But, often for these established companies, she said, it can be hard ""being creative with a risky new product.""Just ask Google. The early days of Gemini were marred by apologies and promises to do better after its chat responses were seen as biased and — according to CEO Sundar Pichai — unacceptable. The rollout occurred amid concerns that startup OpenAI was ahead in the space, even though Google had been working on AI for a long while.""No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry's development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes,"" Pichai wrote at the time.Sometimes big breakthrough innovations, which we want to call disruptive, in fact help sustain existing businesses.Microsoft — with a market value that has again surpassed Apple — is looking pretty savvy having embraced AI for its workplace products. Nvidia, too, has been a big beneficiary of AI companies gobbling up its high-price chips needed for developing their models.Yet the emergence of China's DeepSeek and other new AI models that supposedly use far less pricey computing power raise new questions. It remains unclear where the value of the new technology will land.It's all such a dilemma. At least, nobody is dead — yet.Write to Tim Higgins at tim.higgins@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250510000497:0/
Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Pinterest Shows Strength in Uncertain Advertising Market — Barrons.com,1746808860000,"By Angela PalumboPinterest stock was climbing after the photo sharing platform gave better-than-expected revenue guidance despite continued uncertainty in advertising.Pinterest reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share on revenue of $855 million. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting earnings of 26 cents a share on revenue of $846.5 million.Despite the mixed results, shares were up 5.8% in afternoon trading on Friday to $29.52.Pinterest management said on its earnings call that it expects second-quarter revenue to be between $960 million and $980 million. That is above Wall Street expectations of $958.2 million.Pinterest's strong revenue guidance is a standout since — according to the company's latest 10-K filing — it makes a substantial amount of its revenue from advertising. Other companies that rely on advertising have warned that ad spending, specifically from Asia-based companies, is showing signs of weakness.This comes after the Trump administration removed the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed low-cost items to come into the U.S. without being exposed to tariffs.Asia-based companies spend a lot on advertising their inexpensive products, and if customers shop those products less as they increase in price, advertisers may pull back spending.Fellow social media company Snap also makes a lot of money from advertising, but withheld second-quarter guidance ""given the uncertainty with respect to how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead."" Meta Platforms and Alphabet also noted during their latest earnings conference calls that they are seeing weakness with Asia-based advertiser spending.Pinterest CFO Julia Donnelly said on the earnings call that the company has seen a reduction in ""spend from Asia-based e-commerce retailers in the U.S. given the change in the de minimis exemption.""""However, we've also seen a geographic diversification from some of those Asia-based retailers to our European and Rest of World user regions.

More Young People are Using Gen AI to Plan Trips — Market Talk,1747672500000,"Even as more users look to ChatGPT, Meta AI and Google's Gemini to research products and shop, relatively few are using the platforms to plan trips, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note. Younger cohorts, though, are increasingly turning to the applications for travel planning, with such usage growing at a faster clip than for their older peers in the last six months, the analysts said. Product innovation and improved commercial capabilities, like a Google digital travel agent or similar offering, will likely dictate the pace of adoption from here on out, the analysts say.

Why Nearly 20 Analysts Raised Meta Price Targets Post-Earnings,1746802020000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META rewarded investors with another strong post-earnings gain on May 1 . Shares rose over 4% after the release , and the company’s results extended its streak of beating expectations. Meta has now beaten Wall Street's sales estimates for 11 straight quarters . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] It also exceeded expectations for  adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the ninth quarter in a row . Overall, shares have gained by an average of more than 5% post-earnings over the last 10 quarters .However, a higher share price was far from the only good news investors received. According to forecasts tracked by MarketBeat, nearly 20 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the tech giant. To be fair, several individuals lowered their targets. Still, three times as many boosted them.So, what is driving the majority of analysts to become more bullish on Meta , and exactly how much upside do they see?JPMorgan Sees Good Reason for Meta’s Increased CapExOne major announcement coming from Meta was the company raising its capital expenditure (CapEx) guidance for 2025. Meta has been using CapEx spending to invest significantly in AI infrastructure that supports the growth of its business. Critics have targeted big tech companies for their tens of billions in CapEx spending on AI. However, Meta has been demonstrating extensive gains due to the implementation of AI in its advertising platform. Wall Street analysts are noticing this and showing support for Meta’s higher CapEx spending plans. The success of Meta’s AI initiatives is a key reason many are raising their price targets.Even though more CapEx spending means more cash leaving Meta’s pockets, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE:JPM expressed confidence in this move. They highlighted the company’s “solid results and execution along its AI roadmap” and its “ambitious long-term goals” as justifications for the higher spending.Analysts at Stifel noted Meta’s ongoing investment in artificial intelligence as a key driver of future growth. Piper Sandler believes that Meta’s AI initiatives are “a key factor in the company’s forward momentum."" They stated that the higher CapEx spending aims to fast-track the development and rollout of the technology needed for these initiatives. Truist Securities added that “Meta continues to justify its right to invest.""The fact that people are seeing more ads on Meta and that marketers are spending more on each ad provides evidence of Meta’s strong AI execution. From Q1 2023 to Q1 2025, the number of ad impressions on Meta’s apps is up by around 26% , indicating that marketers are buying a higher volume of ads. Comparing the same two periods, the price paid per ad is up around 17% . In economics, higher prices typically mean that demand should fall. The fact that Meta is raising its ad prices while also seeing higher ad demand demonstrates the huge value that marketers are getting out of its platform. Meta’s AI investments have led to significantly more time spent on its apps. This is a key reason why marketers are willing to direct more ads to them while also paying a higher price .Citi Sees Added AI Clarity as a Positive [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C brought up another key point. Meta laid out the five major growth opportunities it is pursuing through its AI strategy. This was the first time that Meta explained this in a structured format. Those opportunities are: “improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.""Analysts at Citi noted that this clear plan “strengthened confidence in [Meta’s] continued growth trajectory."" Although this may not seem like a big deal, companies often get rewarded for providing clarity around their business .Doing so allows investors to understand how well a company is actually executing. If a company executes well, this can lead to higher multiples. Because Meta is doing just that, adding clarity is a positive. However, it could also backfire if Meta stops executing well.Updated Targets Indicate Nearly 20% Upside in MetaOn average, Wall Street analyst price target updates tracked by MarketBeat after the May 1 earnings release indicate significant 12-month return potential in Meta shares. Compared to the stock’s May 8 closing price of just under $598 per share , these updates imply that shares could rise by over 18%.Overall, the rise in price targets for Meta comes down to one key point: the company is delivering strong results with its AI strategy . This should bolster investor confidence , just as it has done for many on Wall Street.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:ef2d0e56c094b:0-why-nearly-20-analysts-raised-meta-price-targets-post-earnings/
META: Meta Stock Can’t Rebound for Days After News Native ‘Behemoth’ AI Model Is Delayed,1747641865000,"Is Zuckerberg in trouble or is that another opportunity to buy the dip in big tech? According to WSJ, Meta’s engineers can’t come up with anything impressive for the launch of Behemoth. 📢 Meta Stock Can’t Catch a Break- Meta stock NASDAQ:META can’t shake off the selling pressure after it was slammed by investors on Thursday when a bad report came out. A Wall Street Journal story revealed internal struggles over the company’s flagship “Behemoth” AI model. - Shares of Meta dropped 0.6% on Friday, extending their Thursday loss of 2.4% when the news broke out. - Touted as the company’s jewel of Meta’s AI crown, the “Behemoth” project is now getting delayed. An April release got pushed back to May and the May release is now pushed back to fall or later. 🔥 Internal Troubles Loom- Engineers at the big tech giants, the WSJ said, can’t figure out how to make the model better so they’ve decided it’s not worthy of a push live just yet. What’s worse, and maybe more concerning, is that 11 of the 14 researchers who built the OG Llama model have bailed and are no longer with the Facebook owner. - Meta’s AI initiatives have been supporting the stock’s upside swing for months (if not a couple years already). In its latest earnings report, Zuckerberg’s tech titan raised its capital expenditures (capex) for 2025 to $72 billion from $60 billion , focusing the lion’s share of that pile of cash on AI gigs. 🔑 Meta’s Stock Performance- While the stock has been in a mild selloff mode, some money spinners have switched on their buy-the-dip mode. Loop Capital, for one, slapped a bullish price target on Meta stock Friday, predicting a 40% upside to $888 per share from the current $640 a pop. - Year to date, Meta stock has been doing much like the rest of the Magnificent Seven club — not too great. Shares of the company just recently turned positive, boasting a roughly 7% increase since trading kicked off for 2025.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/tradingview:8e7c40fdd094b:0-meta-meta-stock-can-t-rebound-for-days-after-news-native-behemoth-ai-model-is-delayed/

"3 Intriguing Tech Stocks to Watch After Earnings: CRWV, CSCO, CYBR",1747436040000,"There were a number of tech stocks that stood out in this week’s earnings lineup and are worth keeping an eye on as the broader market continues to rebound.Furthermore, three of these tech stocks are standing out in particular, thanks to their artificial intelligence capabilities, which are helping them take market share in their respective industries.CoreWeave – CRWVSpecializing in cloud computing for AI infrastructure, CoreWeave CRWV released its first quarterly report on Wednesday after going public in late March and was able to generate very bullish sentiment. Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave’s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems – CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco’s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco’s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco’s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion. Astonishingly, Cisco’s streak of reaching or exceeding the Zacks EPS Consensus (Quarterly) dates back to 2012 with Q3 EPS of $0.96 topping expectations of $0.91 and rising from $0.88 a share in the comparative quarter.Plus, Cisco announced it will be collaborating with the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), alongside Microsoft, BlackRock BLK, and Nvidia, to invest in scalable AI data centers.CyberArk Software – CYBRStrong financial results and growing demand for its identity security solutions have continued to push CyberArk Software CYBR stock higher as a leader in protecting enterprises from unauthorized access, fraud, and cyber threats. The integration of artificial intelligence into its identity security solutions has also lifted CyberArk’s services, establishing an AI center of Excellence to enhance threat detection and response capabilities.Trading over $350 a share, CYBR is up +35% in 2025. The stellar stock performance could continue with CyberArk reporting Q1 sales of $317.6 million on Tuesday, which soared 43% YoY and exceeded estimates of $305.66 million. Even better, EPS spiked 30% to $0.98 from $0.75 a share in Q1 2024. Blasting Q1 EPS expectations of $0.79, CyberArk has posted a very impressive average earnings surprise of 44.33% in its last four quarterly reports.Bottom Line There was a lot to like about CoreWeave, Cisco Systems, and CyberArk Software’s quarterly reports. It wouldn’t be surprising if these intriguing tech stocks drifted higher in the coming weeks, especially with market sentiment turning bullish again and AI likely to fuel their future growth.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:ad870ba6e094b:0-3-intriguing-tech-stocks-to-watch-after-earnings-crwv-csco-cybr/

Senate Is Set to Pass a Stablecoin Bill. Rules for Crypto Exchanges Will Be Harder. — Barrons.com,1747433880000,"By Joe LightThe crypto industry appears poised to grab its first major legislative victory as Congress moves closer to passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. Its next goal — legislation regulating exchanges and token issuers — might be a steeper hill to climb.As soon as Monday, the Senate plans to hold a key procedural vote on the so-called GENIUS Act. Among other provisions, the bill would require stablecoins, whose value is typically pegged to the dollar, to hold reserves of liquid, safe assets like Treasury bills. Issuers would also have to follow anti-money-laundering and terrorism finance rules and to give coin holders priority to recoup their money in a bankruptcy.Stablecoins underpin most of the $3.3 trillion market for Bitcoin and other crypto tokens. Rather than pay cash for a token, traders typically use stablecoins, which together have a market value of about $250 billion. The largest such token, called USDT, is issued by Tether Holdings. U.S.-based Circle Internet Financial issues USDC, the second-largest token, which was founded in partnership with crypto trading platform Coinbase Global.While stablecoins are currently used primarily for trading, issuers believe they could soon be a serious challenger to traditional payments networks. Their expectation is that they could also save consumers billions of dollars in fees on remittances and other expensive cross-border transactions.The bill requires 60 votes to move through the Senate, and earlier this month, it appeared the GENIUS Act would sail through with bipartisan support. Even though some Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), have been skeptical of the crypto industry push, many other lawmakers have warmed to the industry. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions and lobbying.The bill's recent troubles have hinged on two major issues. First is the potential for big technology companies like Meta Platforms to issue their own stablecoins. A second issue is President Donald Trump's business arrangements with the industry.A revised draft of the bill appears to throw up a roadblock to tech companies issuing stablecoins by requiring nonfinancial public companies to get special approval from a committee. However, the new bill doesn't address concerns that Trump and his family could directly profit from the tokens through its majority ownership of crypto firm World Liberty Financial, which has issued a stablecoin called USD1.A memo, titled ""Negotiations Win Summary,"" circulated among Democratic senators earlier this week, touting ""major victories"" won since early May, including the new Big Tech language. However, it remains to be seen whether the changes will be enough to ensure passage. The bill is expected to have an easier time in the House of Representatives, which won't require a supermajority for approval.A bigger problem for the crypto industry is what the stablecoin bill's troubles could mean for a separate push to approve legislation that would regulate crypto exchanges like Coinbase Global and the thousands of issuers of crypto tokens. During former President Joe Biden's administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase — as well as other exchanges and token issuers — for allegedly violating securities laws, charges that Coinbase denied.Trump's SEC promptly dismissed those cases with prejudice, meaning the same cases can't be brought back later. But there is a fear that a future administration could come back with similar allegations if a new law governing crypto market structure doesn't make clear what does and doesn't fall under the SEC's remit.""After this, getting market structure is even more important,"" said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on a conference panel this week with Gillibrand and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.).How to police crypto exchanges and issuers is a more controversial issue than stablecoins, even within the industry itself. Among the issues are how to decide when a token is sufficiently ""decentralized"" for it not to be subject to securities laws.Apart from the stablecoin venture, Trump or his family own or have ties to a Bitcoin mining firm, several ""meme"" coins and so-called nonfungible tokens, and a venture to launch crypto exchange-traded funds, giving many more reasons for Democrats to blanch at the swift passage of a comprehensive crypto bill.It took several near-death experiences for lawmakers potentially to squeak through stablecoin legislation. That might prove to have been the easy part.Write to Joe Light at joe.light@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Importantly, it will leave in place the 10% ""baseline"" tariff that the U.S. unveiled in April.Trump said the 10% baseline tariff is as low as the U.K. and other countries will see.Also, Lutnick announced that a U.K. company also agreed to buy $10 billion worth of airplanes from Boeing.""It's so good for both countries,"" Trump said, who added that the details will be finalized in ""coming weeks."" Trump has called the deal ""a full and comprehensive"" arrangement with the U.K. that will be the ""first of many.""The stock market extended its rally after the press conference. As of midday Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 1.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4%. Trump said he expected the market ""to really rally"" with the U.K. announcement, at one point advising investors they ""better go out and buy stocks now.""Trump said he was ""very close"" to striking more trade deals and pushed back on the idea that the U.K. deal was announced prematurely before many details had been hammered out.In a TruthSocial post, Trump said that the agreement will increase exports to the U.K. by $5 billion, while increasing market access for cereals, fruits, vegetables, soft drinks and chemicals, among other products. The post said that up to 100,000 of U.K. car imports would be subject to the 10% baseline tariff, as opposed to the increased tariffs on autos.Trump Says Talks With China Will Be Very SubstantiveThe U.K. deal comes just before talks with one of the U.S.'s biggest trade partners are set to begin.Trump said talks with China this weekend will be ""very substantive."" When asked if tariffs on the country could come down, he said they ""can't get any higher.""Many analysts have expected this weekend's meeting between U.S. officials and China to be more of an icebreaker. But Trump said: ""China wants to do something.""Trump also indicated that he might speak with Xi after the talks and that he might also be willing to reduce tariffs after the talks. A lot is riding on these talks, which could thaw the escalation between the two countries that has brought trade to almost a halt. Tariffs on Chinese imports are at 145% and Chinese imports on U.S. goods are at 125%.Trump also stressed he wants China to open up its markets to the U.S., and that would be among the topics Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would bring up at this weekend's talks. ""It would be great for friendship. People think I'm a militant guy. I'm not. Trade can bring greater friendship with China."" That runs counter to the growing concerns of a decoupling between the U.S. and China, fueled by some of the more hawkish members of the administration.The U.K. deal could fuel Chinese officials' fear that Trump keeps renegotiating deals even after one is struck. Peter Mandelson, U.K. Ambassador to the U.S., noted Trump's ""11th hour intervention"" phone call where he demanded ""even more out of this deal than we anticipated.""While both sides heralded the deal, details have yet to be ironed out. Trump said that, ""Over time, there will be adjustments made because we are flexible and think we could do better.""Trump Says U.K. Trade Deal Is First of Many. It Will Only Get Harder.The hope is that this is the start of a streak of bilateral agreements that will substantially bring down overall tariff levels before Trump's ""Liberation Day"" taxes take effect July 8. But there are good reasons the U.K. deal was the quickest and easiest to complete, and it doesn't necessarily guide the way for others.For one, the stakes are relatively low. Trump views trade deficits as damaging to the U.S., but America actually ran a surplus with Britain in the fourth quarter. To be sure, that was the first time that had happened since 2011, excluding the volatile quarters of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it shows that the U.K. sells only about as much to the U.S. as it buys.If Trump wants to get trade deficits down, a deal with the the U.K. won't make a big dent.Beyond that, the U.K. is only the fifth-biggest buyer of U.S. exports, behind Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan. And that doesn't account for the European Union, which represents 20 countries including Germany and France and which will be negotiating as a bloc.Second, the U.K. has some low-hanging fruit to offer as concessions. Besides easing restrictions on food and agricultural imports from the U.S., Britain also imposes a 2% tax on revenues of search engines, social media, and online markets that make money from U.K. users. That hits Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Google parent Alphabet.The details of the U.K. deal have yet to be announced, but it isn't obvious what other countries with trade surpluses with the U.S., such as China, India, and Vietnam, can put on the table.To be sure, Thursday's news is good news, especially for the British car, aerospace and pharmaceutical companies that export a lot to the U.S., such as Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, and AstraZeneca. Spirits maker Diageo, the owner of Johnnie Walker whiskey and Tanqueray gin, must also be breathing a sigh of relief.It's also a sign that deals are possible. But the real relief won't come until the Trump administration reaches agreements with even bigger trade partners.Maersk Cuts Container Market OutlookA.P. Moeller-Maersk stood by its full-year earnings guidance Thursday, but warned that trade tensions could hit global container market volumes.The Danish shipping giant still expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between $6 billion and $9 billion in 2025, but is now forecasting global container volume growth of between a 1% fall and a 4% rise. It had previously expected an expansion of 4%.""With trade tensions flaring up and uncertainty on the rise, global supply chains are once again in the spotlight,"" CEO Vincent Clerc said.The company's results are typically seen as a bellwether for global trade, so its gloomy forecast on volumes will do nothing to ease fears that ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China will weigh on demand. Maersk shares slid 1.4% in early trading.Toyota Warns Tariffs Will Dent ProfitToyota said that its annual profit will plunge on Thursday, warning that U.S. tariffs could dent its bottom line.The Japanese car maker's quarterly earnings topped analysts' forecasts, but it now expects its profit for the current fiscal year to tumble 35% to 3.1 trillion yen ($21.4 billion). It said the impact of Trump's levies in April and May had ""been tentatively factored in"" to its forecast for now. Toyota's American depositary receipts dropped 2.2% in early trading.Trump on Thursday lambasted Mattel and other companies that have said they plan to raise prices in response to tariffs or that have threatened to go to other countries. ""Let them go and we'll put 100% of tariffs on his toys and they won't sell one toy in the United States,"" said Trump, arguing that companies and countries can pick up the cost of tariffs rather than consumers.Tariffs Keep Fed on HoldWednesday's press conference following the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision confirmed that tariffs are the greatest unknown for policymakers. Chair Jerome Powell and colleagues kept rates on hold and said they're waiting before making the next move.For now, the economy is strong enough to give the Fed time. Markets are pricing in an 80% chance for another decision for unchanged rates in June and a 55% chance of a quarter-point cut in July.At Thursday's deal announcement, Trump continued to rail on Powell for not cutting rates, arguing that it would be like ""jet fuel"" if the Fed lowered rates and saying that Powell was always ""too late"" in interest-rate decisions.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%.

Meta's 5 Key Pillars for AI Growth—Zuckerberg's Bold Vision,1747420380000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:META] In its last earnings call, Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META made a concerted effort to add more transparency around its AI strategy .Mark Zuckerberg laid out the “ five major opportunities ” the company is pursuing through its AI investments. Analysts at Citigroup NYSE:C called this out as a significant positive .Understanding these opportunities is crucial to assessing whether the tech giant is living up to expectations going forward.How effectively Meta capitalizes on them will likely influence both investor confidence and the company’s long-term growth trajectory.Opportunities for the Here and Now: Advertising & App ExperiencesThe first opportunity is “ improved advertising ."" This is what Meta has already been doing and generating its great financial results from. The company essentially wants to make it as easy as possible for businesses to get customers.Meta’s technology is learning how to show the right ad to the right person at the right time . As it gets better, advertisers are paying more money per ad , demonstrating the value they are receiving. The company’s AI ad creation tools also saw 30% more usage last quarter. This shows that the tools are likely making it easier for marketers to create ads.The second opportunity is “more engaging experiences."" Essentially, Meta wants to increase the amount of time spent and the level of interaction with content on its apps. This would raise the value of advertising on Meta as users focus more on its apps than on other platforms. The company shares that  improvements to its content recommendation systems have led to a 6% to 35% increase in time spent on its various apps.Facebook started as a place where people shared mostly through written posts. However, image—and video-based content are far more engaging. Zuckerberg sees content progressing even further. People and the content they are watching will interact back and forth with each other in real time. He believes AI will be key in enabling the creation of this type of content. Seeing tangible examples of creators producing this type of content and successfully increasing engagement will be vital.Emerging Opportunities: Messaging Monetization, Meta AI, AI GlassesThe next opportunity is “business messaging.""   Billions of users and messages are sent across Meta’s WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram apps. However, messaging on these platforms is largely unmonetized at this point. Zuckerberg sees a future where companies generate sales through direct messaging customers. Companies in Thailand and Vietnam already do this extensively.However, they use human employees because the labor cost in these countries is low. Companies can use AI agents to message people to make this profitable in developed countries. This could create a large monetization opportunity for Meta. Continued user growth is important as investors await more details on this front. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:META] The fourth opportunity is Meta AI . This AI assistant was built into Meta’s apps and is now available as a standalone app . Meta AI now has almost 1 billion monthly active users. Ultimately, Zuckerberg wants to increase engagement as people talk to Meta AI and discover more content that interests them.This can lead to opportunities to show personalized product recommendations . He also anticipates a premium service , presumably some type of subscription. He says it will continue growing the platform for at least a year before thinking about revenue generation. As with business messaging, increased users and engagement will be important to see going forward.The final opportunity Zuckerberg outlined was “AI devices."" Specifically, he mentioned that glasses are the “ideal form factor” for AI and the metaverse. Zuckerberg believes that over the next five to ten years, many of the more than 1 billion people who wear glasses today will switch to AI glasses.He mentioned that sales of the company’s Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses tripled in the past year. It will be important to pay attention to seeing sales grow in this area and to see significant improvements in the technology.What This All Means for InvestorsNow that Meta has laid out this  AI framework , evaluating the company’s performance becomes easier.Investors should stay keenly aware of different metrics and commentary that indicate how well Meta is performing in each of these areas. When it comes to the emerging opportunities, investors also shouldn’t panic if results stagnate.Zuckerberg notes that the company does not need to succeed in all these areas to succeed overall. Zuckerberg gave markets a  clear score sheet to judge the company's performance with. Now, it's up to Meta to execute.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:a7e411511094b:0-meta-s-5-key-pillars-for-ai-growth-zuckerberg-s-bold-vision/
"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta",1746696240000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 8, 2025– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Q2 earnings estimates for the Tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier.""Tech Earnings Estimates Increase Again: What's Going On?Note: The following is an excerpt from this week'sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>Here are the key points:- Total Q1 earnings for the 419 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +12.2% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 73.7% beating EPS estimates and 61.8% beating revenue estimates. - We continue to believe that this earnings season is less about what companies earned in the first quarter of 2025 and more about sizing up the earnings impact of the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. This is starting to show up in declining estimates for the coming periods. - For 2025 Q2, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down more than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters. - Q2 earnings estimates for the Tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier.What's Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates?The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariffs uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +6.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter last month, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have also declined since the quarter got underway.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.8% in Q2 on +9.9% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed in recent days.In last week's report, regular readers saw this reversal in the Tech sector's revisions trend when we shared the evolution of the sector's full-year earnings growth expectations.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector's estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector's Q2 estimates at least prove that the shift to the annual growth pace isn't solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly the Mag 7 players that reported last week. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT , Alphabet GOOGL and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company's current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.We will be closely monitoring this curious turn in Tech sector estimates.The Earnings Big Picture While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven't been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage.Given all-around worries about the economy's growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:61b075fb2094b:0-zacks-earnings-trends-highlights-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta/
The Next Generation of AI Remains Elusive. All That CapEx Has Yet to Pay Off. — Barrons.com,1747414500000,"By Adam LevineOn Thursday The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platform's largest and most ambitious AI language model, Llama 4 Behemoth, would be delayed for the second time. Meta stock fell on the news, finishing Thursday down 2.4%.In delaying its next generation of language models, Meta has good company in AI start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic.OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 came out in November 2022 and shocked the world with its capabilities; it was the spark that set the AI world ablaze. Just a few months later, it released the much larger GPT-4, a big leap in capabilities.Observers projected this rate of progress into the future, leading to bold predictions of superintelligent computers within just a few years.But it's been two years since GPT-4's release, and GPT-5 is nowhere to be found. Anthropic announced a new Claude model, Opus, last June. It, too, isn't ready.Meta's Behemoth is set to be by far the largest AI model Meta has produced, and it looks like it is running into the same walls that OpenAI and Anthropic hit. The report from the Wall Street Journal said that Meta staffers were questioning ""whether improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release.""A Meta spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The company didn't respond to a request for comment from Barron's.With new large-language models bumping into technical roadblocks, the AI model makers have had to find other ways to make their chatbots perform better. New ""reasoning"" models, like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek r1, have long internal dialogues with themselves and work through problems step-by-step, checking itself as it goes along. They work well, but they're very slow.For example, Barron's asked OpenAI o3, ""Explain how much Meta is spending on AI data centers, and how much their pre-training runs for Llama 4 Behemoth cost."" o3 spent over four minutes talking to itself before spitting about a thousand-word answer. Meanwhile, all that ""thinking"" costs money; for developers, o3 is five times more expensive than OpenAI's best non-reasoning model.New, larger models offer the hope of an o3-type response, without four minutes of thinking.The disappointment from Meta investors on Thursday is compounded by the massive amounts of money the company is spending to make a new model happen. After spending $14 billion in capital expenditures in the first quarter, Meta projected it would spend another $50 billion to $58 billion on AI data centers in the remaining nine months of 2025. Training runs to create these very large models are expensive; Meta's research and development costs for the first quarter were up by 22% from the year before.Investors are still wondering when the payoff for all this investment comes. Advertising is the likely path for Meta to monetize AI, given that 98% of its total 2024 revenue came from advertising.But it's not on the near horizon. ""Our initial focus for Meta AI is really about building a great consumer experience, and that's frankly where all of our energies are kind of directed to right now,"" Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Meta's fourth quarter earnings call. ""There will, I think, be pretty clear monetization opportunities here over time.""More recently, CEO Mark Zuckerberg sounded optimistic about Meta's return on investment when it comes to AI spending. After laying out a range of monetization possibilities, he said, ""We don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.""Shares of Meta were down 1.4% in mid-day trading on Friday.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What's Behind the Surge in Options Income ETFs?,1747413720000,"Income-hungry investors have been piling into ETFs that use options to deliver juicy dividends. We've seen a surge in launches of these products recently, as providers employ innovative strategies to package derivatives within the ETF structure to meet rising investor demand.In addition to offering high yields, these strategies generally help reduce portfolio volatility. However, investors should remember that there’s no free lunch in investing. These products tend to perform best in sideways markets and often underperform during strong bull runs. That said, they can provide some downside protection when stocks fall.Quantitative Researcher Roni Israelov refers to these strategies as a “Devil’s Bargain.” His research shows that trading options to generate income can undermine long-term investment returns.This paper is Roni’s personal research and not a work product of Citadel.Our own analysis of the most popular derivatives-backed ETFs also suggests that investors may be leaving significant returns on the table in their pursuit of high income. Nevertheless, these products have attracted substantial inflows this year, as market volatility has shaken investor confidence.The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI uses proprietary research to select around 130 stocks and writes S&P 500 Index call options to generate income. Its top holdings include NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft MSFT, and Meta META.JEPI and its sister fund, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF JEPQ, are among the top asset gatherers this year.The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF DIVO aims to deliver high income from both dividends and covered calls. Its managers focus on high-quality large-cap companies with a history of dividend growth and write covered calls on individual stocks.While DIVO has outperformed JEPI, both have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term on a total return basis.JEPQ and the Global X Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF QYLD continue to underperform the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d14073830094b:0-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-options-income-etfs/

Estimates for the period have been coming down more than had been the case in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.- Q2 earnings estimates for the Tech sector appear to have reversed course over the last two weeks, with estimates starting to go back up after steadily coming down earlier.What’s Happening to 2025 Q2 Earnings Estimates? The start of Q2 coincided with heightened tariffs uncertainty following the punitive April 2nd tariff announcements. While the onset of the announced levies was eventually delayed for three months, the issue has understandably weighed heavily on estimates for the current and coming quarters.The expectation at present is for Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index to increase by +6.4% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues. The chart below shows how Q2 earnings growth expectations have evolved since the start of the year.While it is not unusual for estimates to be adjusted lower, the magnitude and breadth of the Q2 estimate cuts are greater than we have seen in the comparable periods of other recent quarters.Since the start of the quarter last month, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Transportation, Autos, Energy, Construction, and Basic Materials sectors.Estimates for the two largest earnings contributors to the index – Tech & Finance – have also declined since the quarter got underway.Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +12.8% in Q2 on +9.9% higher revenues. While these earnings growth expectations are materially below where they stood at the start of April, the revisions trend appears to have notably reversed in recent days. You can see this reversal in the sector’s revisions trend in the chart below.In last week's report, regular readers saw this reversal in the Tech sector’s revisions trend when we shared the evolution of the sector’s full-year earnings growth expectations. The updated version of that chart is reproduced here.Hard to tell at this stage how durable this reversal in the Tech sector’s estimates will prove to be, but the favorable turn in the sector’s Q2 estimates at least prove that the shift to the annual growth pace isn’t solely a function of strong positive Q1 earnings releases, particularly the Mag 7 players that reported last week. We can see this trend reversal in the estimates for Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and Meta META.The current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for Alphabet of $2.12 is down from $2.15 on April 4th, but is up from $2.08 on April 25th and $2.07 a week prior to that. Similarly, for Meta, the current Q2 EPS estimate of $5.84 is down from $5.94 on April 4th, but up from $5.70 on May 2nd and $5.51 on April 25th. The revisions trend for Microsoft is similar, though the company’s current Q2 estimate is modestly higher relative to where it stood at the start of April.We will be closely monitoring this curious turn in Tech sector estimates.The Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows expectations for 2025 Q1 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture for the S&P 500 index on an annual basis.While estimates for this year have started coming down lately, there haven’t been a lot of changes to estimates for the next two years at this stage. The chart below should give you a sense of how rapidly this year’s estimates are getting adjusted lower.Given all-around worries about the economy’s growth momentum, it is reasonable to expect these estimates to be lowered further in the days ahead as the tariffs impact starts showing up in data.The modestly negative GDP read for the first quarter of the year primarily reflected the anticipatory effects of the trade regime, with importers stocking up on supplies ahead of the new levies taking effect.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:4c076d49c094b:0-tech-earnings-estimates-increase-again-what-s-going-on/

"AI Is Hitting Search Traffic, Testimony Suggests. Google Stock Falls. — Barrons.com",1746648780000,"By Angela PalumboAlphabet stock fell sharply after Bloomberg reported that an Apple executive's testimony pointed to artificial intelligence taking market share from traditional search.Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, testified in a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google that searches in Apple browsers fell for the first time as people turn to AI for their search queries, according to Bloomberg.This comes as the Justice Department investigates a longstanding partnership between Apple and Alphabet, in which Alphabet pays billions for Apple to use Google as its default search partner.Apple, Alphabet, and the Justice Department didn't respond to requests for comment.Shares of Alphabet closed down 7.3% as the testimony fueled investor concerns that Google might lose its crown as the king of search. Rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, and Meta AI offer increasingly popular alternatives.In 2024, Alphabet added a warning to the risk section of its 10-K annual report. ""Other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy,"" the company said in the filing.Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes rates Alphabet as a Hold with a $166 price target. He wrote in a note on Wednesday that ""today could be a historic turning point in Alphabet sentiment.""""Just trust your eyes and ears — people are going to ChatGPT (and others) for search-equivalent queries more and more,"" Reitzes said.Meanwhile, in August, a U.S. judge ruled that Google was a monopolist in general search services and general text advertising. One potential remedy to that search monopoly could prevent the exclusive agreements that have made Google the default search engine on different devices, including the iPhone.Shares of Apple, whose profits would take a hit were it to lose the Google search deal, were down 1.1% Wednesday.Bloomberg also reported on Wednesday that Cue wants Google to remain the default for Safari. But Cue said Apple has had discussions with Perplexity to add the AI search company's offering to Safari, as well.Perplexity didn't respond to a request for comment.Apple and ChatGPT-parent OpenAI announced a partnership in June. At the time, Apple said it would begin integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, allowing users to access ChatGPT's capabilities.News Corp, the owner of Barron's publisher Dow Jones, has sued Perplexity AI alleging copyright infringement.

Why this investment bank sees more than 30% upside on Meta,1747400441000,"Investment banking firm Loop Capital maintained its bullish stance on Meta platforms with a target price of $888.This indicates a 38% upside from Thursday’s closing price.AI performance Loop Capital’s analysts said that Facebook’s parent company’s artificial intelligence-driven performance has made up for the drop in spending from Chinese advertisers. “We continue to see Meta as the best non-hardware example of tangible, right-now beneficiary of AI and think the stock will outperform the ‘mag-7’ peer group this year,” Loop Capital Analyst Rob Sanderson said. The analyst said the stock will be a beneficiary of non-hardware example of being a beneficiary of AI.The company increased its capital expenditure outlook for 2025 to invest more in data centres for AI. Meta plans to invest $72 billion in capital expenditure this year. While the analyst noted that current core AI investments are constrained by capacity, new data centre AI capacity is coming online. A behemoth concernThis positive note comes after a Wall Street Journal report said that Meta is delaying the rollout of its “Behemoth” large language model. The Behemoth model was first slated to come out in April 2025 but was later pushed to June and now to fall or later, the report said. According to the report, Meta’s engineers were concerned that Behemoth’s performance couldn’t match what the company’s public statements. Meta had touted that Behemoth outperformed similar AI models of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic in some tests. After the report came, Meta’s stock fell over 2% on Thursday. FTC monopoly caseMeta recently asked a federal judge to drop the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) case against the company. The company argued that the FTC failed to prove the antitrust case. FTC had accused Meta of dominating the social media market by buying out rival companies such as Instagram and WhatsApp to buy out the competition.The trial started in April, and the FTC is trying to show Meta was trying to buy out the competition a decade ago by pointing out emails of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg worrying about Instagram and WhatsApp’s growth. If the judge doesn’t drop the case, the trial may run into June as Meta is now presenting its own evidence against the charges. Meta stock continues to shineMeta stock has gained over 7% in the year so far, emerging as the second-best-performing stock among the magnificent seven cohort of stocks in that period. Microsoft is the best performing stock with a 8% gain and Apple has been the worst performing among the group with a 13% decline. Meta’s shares had gained over 28% in the last month as investors cheered strong Q1 results. The company had posted a 16% increase in revenue to $42.31 billion against an expected $41.40 billion. Its net income surged 35% to $16.64 billion.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:9ce1d334c094b:0-why-this-investment-bank-sees-more-than-30-upside-on-meta/

The figure surged 54.8% year over year. Revenues of $7.438 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.45% and increased 35.9% year over year, but declined 2.9% sequentially. The top-line growth benefited from robust Data Center and Client revenues that were partially offset by sluggishness in the Gaming and Embedded segments.AMD shares have risen 1.80% in pre-market trading, driven by strong growth in the key segments. In the year-to-date period, AMD shares have plunged 18.4%.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD Q1 Top Line Rides on Data Center GrowthData Center revenues surged 57.2% year over year to $3.674 billion, accounting for 49.4% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues decreased 4.8% year over year.AMD’s top line benefited from strong Instinct GPU shipments and robust EPYC CPU sales.In the first quarter of 2025, leading hyperscalers such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Google Cloud expanded their use of AMD EPYC CPUs. OCI Compute E6 shapes offered cost-to-performance gains, while Google Cloud launched C4D and H4D virtual machines for enhanced performance, scalability, and efficiency in general-purpose and HPC workloads.Exiting first-quarter 2025, AMD completed its acquisition of ZT Systems, combining its leadership in systems and racks with AMD’s powerful GPUs, CPUs, networking silicon, and open-source software to tap into the $500 billion data center AI accelerator market by 2028.In the first quarter of 2025, AMD expanded its partnerships with Meta Platforms META Dell Technologies DELL, Jio Platforms, Cisco Systems CSCO, Nokia and others to deliver advanced AI solutions and enhance infrastructure.AMD enhances support for frontier AI models on Instinct GPUs with ROCm software, offering day-zero support for the latest Meta AI Llama 4 and Google Gemma 3 models. Dell Technologies also announced the expansion of its AI for Telecom offering, powered by AMD.AMD, Jio Platforms Limited, Cisco, and Nokia have partnered to form a new Open Telecom AI Platform, aiming to deliver AI-driven solutions that enhance efficiency, security, and capabilities.AMD’s Client Revenues Ride on Ryzen and Mobile ProcessorsThe Client segment’s revenues soared 67.7% year over year to $2.294 billion, accounting for 30.8% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues decreased 0.8% year over year.AMD’s latest Ryzen CPUs, particularly those based on the Zen 5 architecture, have seen strong demand, especially for gaming and high-performance desktops and laptops. The launch of new products, like the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D, helped set sellout records and boosted the client segment.The sales of higher-end products, including Ryzen processors for both desktop and mobile, led to higher average selling prices and contributed positively to revenues.AMD Suffers From Weak Gaming & Embedded RevenuesThe Gaming segment’s revenues declined 29.8% year over year to $647 million, accounting for 8.7% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 14.9% year over year. The decline in year-over-year was primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenues.The Embedded segment revenues were $823 million, down 2.7% year over year and 10.8% sequentially. The segment accounted for 11.1% of total revenues.The decline can be attributed to a gradual recovery in demand across various markets, including test and measurement, communications, and aerospace. Additionally, inventory levels among customers in certain areas, such as the industrial sector, remained elevated, which contributed to the slower recovery.AMD’s Margins Expand Y/Y in Q1Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 140 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 53.7%, driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments’ revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 28.1% year over year to $2.213 billion.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 320 bps on a year-over-year basis to 23.9% in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and gross margin.AMD’s Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Remains StrongAs of March 29, 2025, AMD had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.310 billion compared with $5.132 billion as of Dec. 28, 2024.As of March 29, 2025, total debt was $4.16 billion compared with $1.72 billion as of Dec. 28, 2024.Operating cash flow was reported at $939 million compared with $1.299 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.Free cash flow was $727 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with $1.091 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the first quarter, free cash flow margin was 10%.In the first quarter of 2025, AMD returned $749 million to shareholders through a share repurchase program. The company has $4 billion remaining under its current authorization.AMD’s Q2 Guidance UnimpressiveAMD expects second-quarter 2025 revenues of $7.4 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 27%.For the second quarter, AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 43%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be nearly $2.3 billion.For 2025, AMD expects a strong demand environment to drive growth in both the Data Center and Client businesses, as well as a modest increase in the Gaming and Embedded businesses.

AppLovin and Boise Cascade have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1747398960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares AppLovin Corp. APP as the Bull of the Day and Boise Cascade BCC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AppLovin Corp. APP, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:AppLovin Corp. is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level.AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more.Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin’s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users “in-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond” to try to help them tap into a portion of “1.4 billion daily active users.”AppLovin’s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm’s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth.The Ad Tech Company’s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP’s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create “countless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user” to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current “static” experience, where “users see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,” to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company’s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP’s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26.Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin’s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin’s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices.APP has fought against all the allegations and is “fully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.”It hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining “Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.”AppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP’s two-year surge blows away Nvidia’s 360% and Meta’s 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech’s 40% and Meta’s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin’s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector’s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.Bear of the Day:Boise Cascade is one of the top North American producers of engineered wood products and plywood. BCC stock has tanked over 20% in 2025, driven by macroeconomic challenges, industry-specific headwinds, and operational pressures.The engineered wood products powerhouse missed our Q1 2025 earnings estimate by 22% on May 5. It also offered disappointing guidance as part of Boise Cascade’s extended trend of downward EPS revisions.What’s Going On with BCC Stock?Boise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022, before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and a slowing housing market.The company’s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively.Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted earnings dropped 59% YoY in the first quarter to $1.06 a share, missing our estimate by 22%. CEO Nate Jorgensen pointed to “constrained demand, difficult weather, and planned downtime at our Oakdale veneer and plywood mill” as part of its rough quarter and downbeat outlook.Boise Cascade's consensus 2025 earnings estimate has dropped 18% since its Q1 report. Its 2026 estimate has slipped 13% since then, and its overall negative earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company’s earnings are projected to fall another 31% YoY in 2025 on 2% lower sales.Stay Away from Boise Cascade Stock for Now?Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. The company also pays dividends and has a sturdy balance sheet.Investors might want to put Boise Cascade on their watchlists since it could be a longer-term winner. Unfortunately, BCC faces near-term headwinds driven by weak housing market demand, economic uncertainty, and more.Additional content:AppLovin Stock Plunges -26% in 3 Months: Is It a Buy Now?AppLovin Corp. has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry’s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP’s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin’s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand.Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP’s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin’s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP’s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the previous years.APP Is a BuyAPP presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its impressive financial performance and robust growth prospects. The company's recent results and strategic initiatives underscore its potential for continued success in the gaming and software sectors. AppLovin’s strong fundamentals, innovative technology and strategic growth initiatives position it as a leader in its industry. With a solid financial outlook and increasing analyst confidence, we recommend a ""Buy"" rating for APP stock to capitalize on its promising growth trajectory.APP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Zuckerberg's Grand Vision: Most of Your Friends Will Be AI — WSJ,1746610200000,"By Meghan BobrowskyMark Zuckerberg wants you to have AI friends, an AI therapist and AI business agents.In Zuckerberg's vision for a new digital future, artificial-intelligence friends outnumber human companions and chatbot experiences supplant therapists, ad agencies and coders. AI will play a central role in the human experience, the Facebook co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms has said in a series of recent podcasts, interviews and public appearances.""I think people are going to want a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do,"" Zuckerberg said Tuesday during an onstage interview with Stripe co-founder and president John Collison at Stripe's annual conference.Zuckerberg said on a podcast last week that he thinks the average person wants to have more friends and connections with other people than they currently do — and that AI friends are a solution.""The average American I think has, it's fewer than three friends, three people they'd consider friends, and the average person has demand for meaningfully more, I think it's like 15 friends,"" he said in the interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel.On a separate podcast with media analyst Ben Thompson, Zuckerberg continued: ""For people who don't have a person who's a therapist, I think everyone will have an AI.""When someone is making a purchase and needs to speak to a person from that business, an AI agent will be there to help them, Zuckerberg said Tuesday.The Tuesday talk capped a media blitz that included high-profile podcasts and public talks with fellow tech executives including Collison, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. While the Meta CEO has been a guest on podcasts before, the number and quick succession of appearances was rare.Zuckerberg has had mixed success predicting how people will interact with each other in the future. He struck gold with Facebook in the 2000s and made lucrative acquisitions with Instagram and WhatsApp a few years later. More than a decade later, in 2022, he declared that vast numbers of people in the future would interact in virtual worlds and with augmented reality. That bet has yet to come to fruition.The Meta CEO is now throwing resources at AI chatbots — both in its social media apps and in its hardware devices. Meta AI, as it is called, is accessible via Instagram and Facebook, as a stand-alone app and on Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg said Tuesday that nearly a billion people are using the feature now monthly.Zuckerberg said personalized AI isn't just about knowing basic information about a user, it's about ensuring chatbots behave as a good friend might.""You have a deep understanding of what's going on in this person's life, "" he said on Thompson's podcast.Some people, however, aren't buying into Zuckerberg's vision.""The very platforms that have led to our social isolation and being chronically online are now posing a solution to the loneliness epidemic, "" said Meghana Dhar, a former Instagram executive who thinks AI friends will only make such problems worse. ""It almost seems like the arsonist coming back and being the fireman.""Meta has allowed chatbots on its apps to offer a full range of social interaction, including ""romantic role-play,"" even with children, The Wall Street Journal reported.Stephen Schueller, a professor of psychological science at the University of California, Irvine, said AI chatbots cannot fully replace friends or therapists but there are circumstances where the bots might be helpful.""Most people don't have access to a therapist,"" he said. ""So for them, it's not chatbot versus therapist. It's chatbot versus nothing.""Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250507002724:0/
Meta Seeks Dismissal of FTC Case Alleging Illegal Social Media Monopoly,1747392911000,"Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META on Thursday filed a motion asking a federal judge to dismiss a case by the Federal Trade Commission accusing the social media giant of holding an illegal monopoly in social media. The FTC has sought to show that Meta illegally dominated the market for social media platforms used to share updates with friends and family via its WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions, Reuters reported. ""Recent data decisively refutes the claim that 'friends-and-family sharing' insulates Meta's apps from competition from (among many others) YouTube, iMessage, and, most dramatically, TikTok — a disruptive entrant that forced Meta to transform Facebook and Instagram or risk precipitous decline,"" Meta said in a Thursday court filing. ""The FTC has not carried its burden to prove that Meta has monopoly power,"" the filing showed. The FTC didn't immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250516:A3380158:0/
Court clash between Meta and NSO ends in $168 million defeat for spyware firm,1746566380000,"Meta Platforms won a $168 million verdict against the Israeli surveillance firm NSO, the company said Tuesday, capping a six-year arm wrestling match between America's biggest social networking platform and the world's best known spyware company. Meta had already won a December ruling finding that NSO had unlawfully exploited a bug in its messaging service WhatsApp to plant spy software on its users' phones. On Tuesday, a jury in California ruled that NSO owed Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages - and $167.3 million in punitive damages, Meta said. ""Today's verdict in WhatsApp's case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,"" Meta said in a statement. In its statement, NSO said it would ""carefully examine the verdict's details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal."" NSO, an Israeli firm that first drew global attention in 2016, has become ""a poster child for the surveillance industry and their abuses and impunity,"" said Natalia Krapiva, a senior lawyer with the human rights group Access Now. NSO has long argued that its software is used to track terrorists and pedophiles, but the firm has been implicated in abusive surveillance in countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and El Salvador. WhatsApp's lawsuit - which was filed in 2019 and at one point made its way to the Supreme Court - has been closely followed both by NSO's competitors in the surveillance technology space and by human rights advocates critical of the industry. Victims of state-backed hacking have struggled to hold suppliers of spy software accountable for what their customers do with their tools, while hacking firms have long worried that their products could draw legal sanctions. The WhatsApp verdict was a sign that both outcomes were possible, said Krapiva. ""This is something that will hopefully show spyware companies that there will be consequences if you are careless, if you are brazen, and if you act in such a way as NSO did in these cases,"" she said.Beyond sending a message to spyware merchants, the case also pulled back the curtain - ever so slightly - on the inner workings of NSO itself.The court heard about NSO's 140 person-strong research team, whose $50 million budget was in part devoted to exploiting security vulnerabilities in smartphones. An attorney for the company disclosed that its customers included Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico - rare on-the-record names from NSO's closely guarded client list.Much about the spyware company's targets and clients remains unknown, in part because the firm refused to hand over evidence. In her December ruling, District Judge Phyllis Hamilton accused NSO of having ""repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery and failed to obey court orders regarding such discovery."" The Guardian newspaper reported last year that Israeli officials had seized documents from NSO in an effort to prevent the files from making their way to U.S. court.""This whole case is shrouded in so much secrecy,"" Hamilton said during the trial. ""There's so much that's not known.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L1N3RE02Z:0-court-clash-between-meta-and-nso-ends-in-168-million-defeat-for-spyware-firm/"
