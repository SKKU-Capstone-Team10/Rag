Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

These 4 Top Investors Bought Over 6 Million Broadcom Shares in Q1,1747922400000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO is one of just 10 stocks globally with a market cap over $1 trillion as of May 21. This makes it one of the most closely watched stocks in the market. Retail investors and famous money managers have come to know this company well. It has played a key role in the AI infrastructure buildout, which has been driving the market higher for some time.Many big investors bought Broadcom in large amounts in Q1. This became clear when they released their 13F filings . That makes a good deal of sense, considering that Broadcom shares fell by more than 27% in Q1. The analysis below will detail some of the highest-profile investors who bought Broadcom in spades. It is important to note that the data on these purchases only extends to March 31. Thus, these investors could have sold or bought more Broadcom shares since. Still, knowing how investors felt about Broadcom and similar companies in Q1 can help retail investors understand how to view the stock going forward.AI Bubble Bear Grantham Owned Nearly 14x More AVGO Than NVIDIA in Q1A huge purchaser of Broadcom in Q1 was investor Jeremy Grantham. Grantham co-founded Grantham, May and Van Otterloo (GMO) and is the company’s long-term investment strategist. Grantham is often considered a contrarian investor, pushing back against overzealous market trends. Many consider him to have predicted the dot-com bubble around two years before it popped. Despite Grantham’s claims that AI investing is a bubble, Grantham’s GMO bought over 1.5 million shares of Broadcom in Q1. Additionally, many of the firm's biggest holdings are among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have invested tens of billions in AI infrastructure.Still, the big decline in Broadcom shares in Q1 could back up Grantham’s claims that the AI bubble would deflate. As of the May 21 close, Broadcom is trading only around 6% below its 2025 high. Assuming the stock stays near this level through the end of Q2, seeing GMO greatly reduce its Broadcom holdings in its Q2 13F would be a logical next step. This would indicate he actually sees Broadcom as part of the AI bubble and simply took advantage of it temporarily deflating in Q1. Interestingly, Grantham has just a $21 million position in NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , versus $291 million in Broadcom. Sure, NVIDIA only fell 19% in Q1, but this positioning indicates Grantham sees Broadcom as a relatively better value .Renaissance, Two Sigma, and Dalio Buy Over 5 Million Broadcom Shares CombinedAnother massive high-profile Broadcom buyer in Q1 was Renaissance Technologies , an investment firm many regard as the most successful hedge fund of all time. Renaissance purchased over 2.4 million shares of Broadcom in Q1, massively increasing the firm’s stake in the company. Renaissance is notoriously tight-lipped about its thoughts on the market, making it difficult to assert its thinking. However, depending on the data points looked at, one could argue that Renaissance may or may not still see value in Broadcom shares. [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Two Sigma Advisors and Bridgewater Associates are other notable investment companies that bought significant shares of Broadcom in Q1. They bought around 2.5 million and 280,000 shares, respectively. Two Sigma has become known as one of the pioneers of quantitative investing, relying largely on complex math and non-traditional data to invest. For many, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio needs no introduction. He is a prolific author, investing thought leader, and has built what was, at one time, the largest hedge fund in the world.At the end of Q1, Two Sigma held 3.9 million shares of Broadcom. The company hasn’t had even close to this big of a position since Q3 2024, when it held 3.6 million shares. Notably, Broadcom’s average closing price during that period was just $159. In Q1, that figure was $211. The company held more shares in Q1, when the average closing price was about 33% higher. This suggests it thinks Broadcom's intrinsic value has increased very significantly. However, whether it sees value in prices near $230 or higher is more questionable.Broadcom’s Big Gain in Q2 Could Reveal These Investors' True ThoughtsSince Broadcom’s shares now only trade marginally lower than their 2025 peak , these investors' next 13F filings could reveal at what price they are comfortable holding shares.If Broadcom remains near the $230 mark through the rest of Q2, continuing to hold their shares could indicate these investors see potential for the stock to test all-time highs near $250.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f0037420b094b:0-these-4-top-investors-bought-over-6-million-broadcom-shares-in-q1/
Does Broadcom's Expanding Portfolio Make the AVGO Stock a Buy?,1747844580000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have surged 37.2% in the past month. The company is benefiting from an expanding portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business, strong balance sheet and impressive free cash flow. Broadcom has outperformed its closest semiconductor peers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Marvell Technology MRVL, shares of which have returned 35.6%, 32.6% and 21%, respectively, over the same time frame.AVGO Stock’s PerformanceBroadcom’s strategy of updating its portfolio on a frequent basis has been a key catalyst. The company is expanding its portfolio with the launch of its third-generation 200G per lane (200G/lane) Co-Packaged Optics product line. In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C) This follows March showcase of 200G/lane DSP and SerDes, 400G optics, and PCIe Gen6 over optics products at the 2025 Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC). Strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

CRDO vs. AVGO: Which AI-focused Semiconductor Stock is the Better Buy?,1747831440000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. CRDO and Broadcom Inc. AVGO are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions essential for AI-driven data centers.The data center market is undergoing rapid transformation as organizations accelerate their digital initiatives, including the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, along with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This surge in digital activity has resulted in explosive data growth, placing significant pressure on existing data center infrastructure. Consequently, there is a rising need for advanced data processing and storage solutions to support AI workloads. This trend presents strong growth opportunities for companies like Credo and Broadcom.So, now the question arises: Which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let’s dive into the pros and cons for each company.The Case for CRDOCredo is gaining a strong market presence in both Ethernet and Active Electrical Cables (AECs) solutions specialized for data centers. AEC products experienced triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by their increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.Credo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. CRDO’s PCIe and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market.

The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Case for AVGOBroadcom is a diversified semiconductor company with a strong presence in AI chip development space. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. These hyperscalers are significantly ramping up investment in their next-generation frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators and AI data centers with larger clusters. AVGO noted that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Consequently, AVGO’s Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Apart from these three customers, AVGO is also working with four other hyperscalers to aid them in building their own customized AI accelerators.XPUs are necessary to train Generative AI (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. Its next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. AVGO is now planning to tape out the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.In the last reported quarter, semiconductor solutions revenues (55% of net revenues) totaled $8.2 billion, rising 11% year over year, driven by strong AI semiconductor revenues. AI-related revenues grew 77% year over year to $4.1 billion, which was a major driver of overall revenue growth. This growth was driven by higher shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers for AI applications.For second-quarter fiscal 2025, Broadcom expects revenues of $14.9 billion, while AI semiconductor revenues are projected to grow 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow 17% year over year to $8.4 billion.Price Performance and Valuation for CRDO & AVGOOver the past month, CRDO and AVGO have registered gains of 67.8% and 36.3%, respectively.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 15.50X, lower than AVGO’s 16.05X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO?Analysts have kept their earnings estimates unchanged for CRDO’s bottom line in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, for AVGO, there is a marginal upward estimate revision.CRDO or AVGO: Which is a Better Pick?Both CRDO and MRVL are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI driven data center market. CRDO at present flaunts a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.""We see Nvidia's leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,"" the analysts said.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"
Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals — Barrons.com,1747634400000,"By Tae KimAmid the gold rush to build data centers and AI models, Nvidia has sold the most sought-after tools, driving triple-digit annual sales growth and turning the company into a $3 trillion market value giant.For the most part, Nvidia sells a ""full-stack AI solution"" that includes computer processors, or CPUs, networking equipment, and the AI accelerator, also known as the GPU. It's inside an Nvidia-designed server rack. Together, these components helped to train and serve new AI models.But now Nvidia is taking a significant step toward opening its platform, allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chip. It offers the option for future Nvidia racks with, say, Nvidia and Qualcomm chips inside.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the move on Monday at the COMPUTEX trade show in Taiwan. The new system is called NVLink Fusion.""A tectonic shift is under way: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected — AI is being fused into every computing platform,"" Huang said. ""NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures.""Nvidia's current top-of-the-line GB200 NVL72 AI server rack system includes Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.Initial NVLink Fusion AI chip partners include MediaTek, Marvell, and AIchip. Fujitsu and Qualcomm are the initial CPU partners.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack scale architecture, we're advancing our vision of high-performance, energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Qualcomm Technologies CEO Cristiano Amon said in a press release.The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's ecosystem when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology.For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its server platform and to drive more revenue.There's one catch: Broadcom, which makes many of the custom AI chips for large tech companies, wasn't on Nvidia's initial partner list, though the company said more partners could be added in the future.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

QCOM Unveils Advanced Snapdragon 7 Chipset: Should You Buy the Stock?,1747419780000,"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QCOM recently introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. One of the significant improvements in the new platform is a 65% improvement in AI performance. This will ensure seamless support for various large language models, generative AI assistants and stable diffusion image generation on smartphones. A 30% faster GPU rendering will facilitate improved framerates and smoother gameplay. To improve the gaming experience, the company has included Snapdragon Elite Gaming features into the platform. 27% improvement in CPU performance will ensure seamless multitasking and enhanced system responsiveness.Qualcomm has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs such as HONOR and vivo have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.The solution brings several multimedia capabilities. New camera capabilities include video super resolution, hardware electronic image stabilization and advanced image processing features. The 3GPP release 17 for 5G, along with support for WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0, ensures seamless connectivity. Moreover, support for Snapdragon Sound technology, including Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network technology, ensures premium wireless audio quality.Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series is used primarily in mid-range smartphones. Availability of advanced camera capabilities, action-packed gaming and advanced on-device AI in the Snapdragon 7 series chip set will be a game changer for mid-range smartphone users.QCOM Rides on Portfolio Strength, Innovation and AI FocusThe company has ramped up its efforts to solidify its position in the rapidly growing AI domain. QCOM took the market by storm with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs, Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions. Qualcomm is also witnessing solid market traction in the automotive business. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, automotive revenues rose 59% to $959 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform.These developments suggest Qualcomm is moving beyond the smartphone industry by diversifying its portfolio and venturing into new high-growth verticals such as AI PC, AI data centers, automotive and edge AI industrial IoT technologies and solutions. Its strategy of continuous innovation and portfolio diversification will likely boost commercial prospects.Major Challenges for QCOMSamsung and Apple, Inc. AAPL, which have been major buyers of Qualcomm chips for several years, are now moving toward in-house chip development. Samsung has launched several mobile chips under its Exynos lineup, which are used in both the mid-range and premium smartphone segments. Apple has also introduced several chips for its smartphone and PC products. The company uses the A18 Pro chip for the iPhone 16 Pro series and the A18 for iPhone 16 models. Moreover, in the iPhone 16e model, Apple has replaced the Qualcomm modem previously used in iPhone 15 models with an in-house C1 modem. Such initiatives from long-standing customers are a major concern for Qualcomm.The company is also facing intense competition from MediaTek in the mid-range smartphone segment. In the network space, the company faces competition from Broadcom Inc. AVGO. Despite some major issues, Intel Corporation INTC continues to be the dominant player in the PC market. With innovative launches such as Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors, the company is gaining strong momentum in the AI PC domain. Despite enhanced power efficiency and connectivity of Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, Qualcomm has to match the seamless compatibility that Intel processors offer with existing software to gain a competitive edge. This is a complex endeavor.Qualcomm has an extensive presence in China. Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can significantly impact its operations. However, following negotiations, both the United States and China have decided to temporarily reduce tariffs. If they fail to reach a resolution within this period, tariffs may rise again. This will negatively impact QCOM’s operating margin.Price PerformanceQCOM shares have declined 21% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 20.7%. The company has outperformed Intel but underperformed relative to Broadcom. Intel has declined 32.7%, while Broadcom has surged 64.7%.Estimate Revision Trend of QCOMEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 0.34% to $11.8 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has decreased 1.85% to $12.21. This portrays mixed sentiments about the stock’s growth potential from investors.End NoteQualcomm intends to be the driving force in the next wave of AI innovations. The company’s effort to broaden its market reach beyond the mobile chipset market is an important step toward that direction. The future of AI innovation is not concentrated in a particular sector, but it is dispersed across a vast ecosystem. Hence, Qualcomm’s multi-dimensional approach is creating new revenue-generating opportunities in automotive, industrial IoT, data center, and edge AI domains while also strengthening its leadership position in the mobile chipset industry.However, aggressive competition in the smartphone chipset market and several of QCOM’s client strategy of in-house chip development are likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High exposure to the demanding environment of China is a major concern. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia and Broadcom",1747382280000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO.3 Reasons U.S. Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Broadcom vs. Marvell: Which Semiconductor Stock Has Greater Upside?,1747324080000,"Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL are key providers of semiconductor solutions for end markets, including AI-powered data centers and cloud service providers. Both offer custom AI accelerators (XPUs) that power AI deployment. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expects a double-digit growth rate in 2025, with semiconductor sales surging 19.1% to $627.6 billion in 2024. This offers significant growth opportunities for both Broadcom and Marvell.However, both AVGO and MRVL have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions amid tariff-related uncertainties. While Broadcom shares have climbed a modest 0.1% year to date, Marvell shares plunged 40.3%.AVGO and MRVL Stock’s PerformanceSo, Broadcom or Marvell, which is a better buy amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop? Let’s find out.Broadcom Rides on Strong Demand for XPUsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.MRVL’s Growing Data Center and Networking Market is PositiveMarvell’s custom AI silicon and electro-optics solutions have enabled it to become a leading player in the high-performance computing space. The company is benefiting from hyperscalers’ ramping up their use of custom silicon for AI workloads. In fiscal 2025, AI-based revenues crossed its $1.5 billion target, and Marvell expects to “very significantly” surpass its $2.5 billion AI revenue target in fiscal 2026. Marvell’s management is confident that revenues from its custom XPU solutions will continue expanding in fiscal 2027 and beyond.As AI workloads grow, data centers need enhanced networking and interconnect products. MRVL is capitalizing on this shift with its high-speed optical interconnects, including 800G PAM, 400ZR DCI, and its industry-first 1.6T PAM DSP (digital signal processor), which cuts down on optical module power usage by 20%.Furthermore, the shift from copper to optical connectivity in AI infrastructure represents a massive growth opportunity for the company. MRVL’s Co-Packaged Optics technology and its development of the industry's first 2nm silicon IP for cloud and AI workloads solidify its position in the next-generation networking space.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, MRVL’s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc.

3 Reasons US Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated,1747316940000,"2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.Image Source: CNNThe Nasdaq 100 is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Apple ( AAPL ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Broadcom ( AVGO ) have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative.Image Source: @subutrade.786 Fibonacci & Previous Resistance The S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.Image Source: TradingViewIn addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1ab6aa09a094b:0-3-reasons-us-equities-may-be-short-term-overheated/
Broadcom Set to Surge as AI Diffusion Rule Ends,1747316880000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Over approximately the last three weeks, markets have been on the rise big-time. The  S&P 500 closed just under $5,900 on May 14, just around 4% lower than the all-time high it reached in February. As market sentiment shifts, Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , a leading semiconductor stock , has emerged as a top beneficiary. Despite at one point being down nearly 38% in 2025, Broadcom is now just slightly in the green this year as of the May 14 close.The announcement of the trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted the stock. Shares jumped almost 12% within two days after the announcement. However, there were other highly positive recent pieces of news for Broadcom that the trade deal may somewhat overshadow.Most notable is that President Trump is ending the Biden-era “AI Diffusion Rule."" Its end has the potential to substantially benefit companies like Broadcom . So, what exactly was the AI Diffusion Rule , and what does its cancellation mean for Broadcom?Understanding the End of AI Diffusion, NVIDIA and AMD See Immediate BenefitThe purpose of the AI Diffusion Rule was to give the U.S. government extensive control over which countries can and cannot get access to advanced AI chips made by American firms . Specifically, it controls chips used to train advanced AI models.The rule categorized countries into three different tiers. Tier 1 countries included many of America’s closest allies. These countries face no restrictions. Tier 2 countries include most other countries. India, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were notable inclusions.These countries were limited in the number of chips they could buy. Tier 3 countries , which include adversaries like China and Russia, were not allowed to buy any advanced chips.Really, the government was trying to specifically prevent China and Russia from getting these chips to slow the advancement of their AI capabilities. With the ending of AI Diffusion , that isn’t likely to change. However, how the United States treats those Tier 2 countries is changing. NVIDIA's NASDAQ:NVDA announcement that it would sell 18,000 of its most advanced chips to Saudi Arabia on the same day the government eliminated the AI Diffusion rule provides evidence of this.Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a huge AI partnership in the country.Overall, the end of AI Diffusion means that chip companies with significant AI capabilities now have a much larger opportunity to sell their most advanced technology to these Tier 2 countries. Many of these countries are extremely wealthy, adding to the size of the opportunity . This extends to Broadcom, but in a slightly different way than NVIDIA and AMD.The End of AI Diffusion: Broadcom Waits Its Turn to CapitalizeBroadcom's custom chips are largely used for AI model inference, rather than primarily for AI model training. Training comes before inference. For countries like Saudi Arabia, this means they need time to train their models with NVIDIA and AMD chips . After that, Broadcom's chips can really make a difference. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO]Thus, the fact that NVIDIA and AMD are striking deals opens up the door for Broadcom to sell large amounts of chips to Tier 2 countries down the line. How long that might take is hard to say, but a big opportunity now exists for Broadcom nonetheless.The benefit to Broadcom comes even though the company hasn’t expressed concerns about AI Diffusion, at least with a specific set of customers. In the company’s last earnings call , Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon specifically asked about this.Rasgon asked whether AI diffusion would impact Broadcom’s design wins or shipments for the three big AI customers the firm is selling to in volume.In response, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said, “To answer your question directly, no, we don't have any concerns."" This underscores Broadcom’s focus on inference chips , which AI Diffusion did not directly impact. However, they were indirectly impacted because training comes before inference. So, with AI Diffusion ending, the positive impact on Broadcom comes from the expansion of its serviceable market.The End of AI Diffusion Adds Another Broadcom TailwindFor the reasons discussed above, Broadcom can win big due to AI Diffusion ending . Its chips now have a strong path forward to getting into the hands of some of these huge Tier 2 countries. But, cashing in will likely take time.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:bbce48cea094b:0-broadcom-set-to-surge-as-ai-diffusion-rule-ends/

Quality Growth Stocks Make Sense for an Uncertain Economy — Barrons.com,1747164480000,"By Jacob SonenshineThis time is a little different.When the market rallies, investors usually want to own the riskiest stocks. But right now, the winning formula has changed: The best names to buy are good-quality companies that also have high potential for growth.The S&P 500 is up 17% from the low point it hit in its nasty decline in April. Areas that lost the most when expectations about the economy soured have led the way, rebounding faster as the picture has brightened. The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce sky-high tariffs that were choking off trade between the countries, and the White House has indicated that deals with other countries are on the way.That would mean reduced tariffs, less inflation, and more spending by consumers and businesses.At this point, investors looking for stocks to buy at today's prices should avoid economically sensitive, riskier industries such as retail, restaurants, or financials. They are now a hair above their levels just before President Donald Trump unveiled surprisingly high tariffs against a wide range of countries in early April, meaning they are no longer reflecting much potential economic weakness.Yet harder times are still a possibility. While Trump has partially rolled back tariffs, a 10% baseline tariff rate remains in place. Interest rates, all the while, have remained around 4%, where they have now hovered across various maturities for a few years . High rates take time to push consumer spending down, so that is a continuing source of pressure on consumers.Economic growth is more likely to slow down than to significantly accelerate.Given all that, strategists at UBS screened for higher-quality companies that can increase their earnings regardless, reasoning those stocks are likely to perform best as the economy adjusts to President Donald Trump's trade war.The bank looked for companies with four qualities. They had to have a market capitalization of at least $10 billion, higher expected earnings growth than most publicly traded companies, and trade at forward price/earnings multiples closer to their historical averages than most stocks. Finally, companies had to be of higher ""operational quality"" than most businesses.The latter means they have characteristics that enable them to consistently increase earnings. Those include pricing power — the ability to lift prices without damaging demand — and high profit margins, which insulate a company from losing money during recessions.Stocks that make the cut can be expected to offer growth at a reasonable price, or GARP. UBS's screen yielded six names: Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company; Broadcom; Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks; Cintas, which supplies uniforms and cleaning supplies to businesses; Heico, the dominant maker of aircraft parts; and Salesforce, the provider of cloud-based sales software.Analysts expect sales at Salesforce to rise by just over 9% annually to $49.1 billion by 2027, according to FactSet. If the economy stumbles, some customers may scale back their investments in new cloud-based technologies as they watch their budgets, but any cuts are likely to be mild. Companies need the newest, fastest, and most cost efficient technologies to make the most of sales opportunities.That is where Salesforce comes in. Its artificial intelligence agents give customers a reason to pay higher subscription prices for its software products, so its revenue growth is higher than for the average S&P 500 company.If the company remains disciplined with costs, that would help profit margins increase, sending earnings per share up about 13% annually over the coming three years, according to FactSet. That compares with the 11% in growth in the aggregate earnings expected for companies in the S&P 500.That kind of profit growth would likely push the stock higher because its price/earnings ratio isn't likely to drop much from its current level. Salesforce trades at about 25 times the earnings per share expected for the coming 12 months, about 14 points below its five-year average of about 39 times. The S&P 500 sells for 21 times, compared with the five-year average of 20 times.Buy GARP stocks.

NYSE:NET , the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application.AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.Palo Alto Networks® NASDAQ:PANW , the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations.Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete. The best-selling platform surged past $1 billion cumulative bookings in FY25 Q2, making it our fastest offering to reach this milestone. Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks doubled down on cloud security with the introduction of Cortex Cloud, converging its industry-leading CNAPP and CDR capabilities on the unified Cortex platform.Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) recently announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats.Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries.CrowdStrike NASDAQ:CRWD recently released its 2025 State of SMB Cybersecurity Report, uncovering a widening gap between cybersecurity awareness and readiness among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While 93% of SMBs consider themselves knowledgeable about cybersecurity risks and 83% report having a plan in place, just 36% are investing in new tools – and only 11% have adopted AI-powered defenses.Based on insights from SMB decision-makers across industries and company sizes, the research reveals that despite rising awareness, most SMBs still lack the budget, tools and in-house expertise to stop modern threats. With attacks becoming more advanced and frequent, SMBs need protection that’s easy to use, affordable to deploy and built to scale with their business.About FN Media Group:At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #tickertagpressreleases #pressreleasesFollow us on Facebook to receive the latest news updates: https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmediaFollow us on Twitter for real time Market News: https://twitter.com/FNMgroupFollow us on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/DISCLAIMER: FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates Financialnewsmedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia. ""Everything needs an accelerator,"" they wrote.

Micron vs. Broadcom: Which Stock is the Smarter Semiconductor Bet?,1747058760000,"Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO are both entrenched in high-growth semiconductor arenas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and cloud infrastructure, but they take radically different paths to capture value. Micron is a dominant memory chip maker, while Broadcom specializes in networking, custom silicon and infrastructure software.Both companies have seen share price fluctuations in 2025 amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While MU shares have risen 2% year to date, AVGO dropped 10.2%. Yet with AI adoption accelerating, which stock stands out as the smarter semiconductor investment today? Let’s find out.Micron: AI Memory Boom Aids, Margin Worries LingerMicron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, Micron revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Despite Micron's efforts to capitalize on rising AI-related demand, margin pressures and pricing challenges raise red flags. While Micron’s top-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was impressive, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Broadcom: Profitable, Predictable and Primed for AIMeanwhile, Broadcom offers investors a more diversified and durable growth profile. The company is deeply embedded in next-generation AI infrastructure through its custom application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) and high-performance networking chips, which are fueling its top-line growth.Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require a complex integration of compute, memory and I/O capabilities to achieve the essential performance at lower power consumption and costs. Broadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion.What’s more impressive is that Broadcom is already sampling the world’s first 3nm XPU chips and plans to launch a 2nm version using advanced 3.5D packaging later this year. The company targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. It believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric.Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Super Micro Computer, has been a key catalyst.From a financial perspective, Broadcom consistently delivers gross margins above 70% and operating margins above 60%, driven by its high-value custom silicon business and enterprise software portfolio. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP EPS soared 45.5% on 25% higher revenues. Looking forward, Broadcom expects total revenues in the second quarter to surge 19% year over year to $14.9 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: MU Picks Up Steam, AVGO Holds SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Micron’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 41% and 433%, respectively. However, the estimate revision trend for MU’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS has remained highly volatile.Micron EPS Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 21% and 36%, respectively. However, unlike Micron, estimates for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS have demonstrated a steady upward revision trend. This stability is a testament to the company’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.Broadcom EPS Estimate Revision TrendValuation: MU is Cheaper, but AVGO Deserves the PremiumMicron is trading at a forward sales multiple of 2.24X, way below Broadcom’s 14.48X.Broadcom does seem pricey compared to Micron. However, AVGO’s higher valuation is backed by superior profitability and a structurally more diversified business. The company boasts steady gross and operating margins compared to MU’s more variable margin profile.Micron’s falling profitability raises questions about its ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Conclusion: Broadcom is the Better Long-Term PlayBoth Micron and Broadcom are riding the same megatrends — AI, cloud and data centers — but they’re doing so from vastly different positions of strength.Micron has upside potential due to its leadership in AI memory. However, that promise is being weighed down by margin pressure and pricing volatility. It’s still a play on memory cycles more than a structural AI winner.Meanwhile, Broadcom brings more stability to the table with strong fundamentals, durable earnings, and a balanced mix of AI-driven hardware and enterprise software. While its valuation is higher, it’s supported by margin strength and earnings consistency.So, for investors seeking a smarter semiconductor bet amid global uncertainty, Broadcom remains the more compelling choice.Currently, AVGO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared to MU, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"The Score: Disney, Berkshire Hathaway, Ford and More Stocks That Defined the Week — WSJ",1746825000000,"By Francesca FontanaThe Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them.Walt DisneyInvestors celebrated Disney's plans for a new theme park.The entertainment behemoth's seventh global park is to be built in Abu Dhabi, an expansion of its lucrative Experiences business into a new market.Disney also posted strong earnings, saying that its U.S. theme parks attracted more guests and higher spending from visitors in the March quarter.The company's parks in China and France have helped boost its other businesses, including its streaming platforms and its film and TV studios.Disney and its rivals continue to face issues such as declining cable-TV usage and underperformance at the box office. A new threat has also emerged: President Trump's recent comments calling for 100% tariffs on films produced outside of the U.S.Disney shares jumped 11% Wednesday, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Berkshire HathawayThe Oracle of Omaha is retiring.At the conclusion of Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3, legendary investor Warren Buffett said he plans to step down as chief executive in December.Greg Abel, who has been on deck to succeed Buffett as CEO since 2021, will take the reins on Jan. 1. Buffett will remain the conglomerate's chairman.Buffett, who is 94, has led the company for the past 60 years. His retirement announcement surprised shareholders, as many thought that Buffett would remain CEO until his death.Berkshire shares lost 5.1% Monday.Ford MotorFord and Mattel joined the growing group of companies scrapping annual guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.Ford on Tuesday reported a steep decline in quarterly profit and suspended its annual guidance, saying it couldn't predict the full impact of President Trump's levies. The automaker said tariffs could cut $1.5 billion from a key measure of profit.Mattel also scrapped its annual forecast. The maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels said it could increase U.S. toy prices, as the company is bracing for a $270 million tariff hit. Mattel is also moving more of its production out of China.Ford shares rose 2.7% Tuesday, while Mattel gained 2.9%.Cleveland-CliffsAs President Trump seeks to build up American steel demand, one of the major U.S. steelmakers is shrinking.Cleveland-Cliffs on Wednesday said it would pause or slow operations at six plants after posting a wider first-quarter loss and lower revenue. The production cuts and changes in operations are expected to affect about 2,000 jobs and save the steelmaker $300 million a year.While steel prices climbed as customers bought up steel ahead of Trump's tariffs on imported metal, that rally has stalled. Now, buyers are holding off on placing big orders in an uncertain U.S. economy.Cleveland-Cliffs shares plummeted 16% Thursday.BroadcomU.S. chip stocks got a boost, thanks to the possibility of a reprieve from tight export controls.The Trump administration plans to overhaul controversial regulations that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips individual countries can buy, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.A White House spokeswoman said that the Commerce Department plans to replace the rule — commonly known as AI diffusion — which was set to go into effect May 15.The decision is a temporary boon for the tech titans, but many executives are still bracing for tight restrictions. The Trump administration recently cracked down on Nvidia selling a specialized AI chip to China, causing the company to take a $5.5 billion charge.Broadcom shares rose 1.5% Thursday.BoeingThe new U.S. trade deal with the U.K. includes some good news for Boeing.President Trump on Thursday announced that his administration and the U.K. had made a trade deal pact, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a British airline would buy $10 billion worth of Boeing planes.In exchange for the U.K. purchasing the jets and giving American farmers greater access to U.K. markets, the Trump administration agreed to roll back tariffs imposed on British steel and automobiles. The U.K. is also cutting tariffs on some U.S. beef imports and on ethanol.On Friday, British Airways owner IAG said it has ordered 32 Boeing planes, confirming purchases touted by Lutnick the day before.Boeing shares gained 3.3% Thursday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

Wolfspeed Stock Plunges as Analysts Weigh In. Chip Maker's Debt Is the Worry. — Barrons.com,1746805020000,"By Brian SwintShares of semiconductor maker Wolfspeed plunged Friday as Wall Street analysts issued negative research on the stock.Earnings that came in line with expectations weren't enough to reassure investors concerned with the company's debt levels.The problem is that Wolfspeed, which produces silicon wafers in the U.S., was promised $750 million under former President Joe Biden's Chips Act. Receiving it may be a problem as President Donald Trump tries to undo his predecessor's work. At the same time, the company has a $575 million payment due to creditors next year.Short interest in Wolfspeed, a measure of how much of a company's stock has been borrowed for bets that the price would drop, has taken off this year. The shares went through a short squeeze last month as investors bid up the stock price, forcing short sellers to buy to close out their bearish bets.Wolfspeed is slimming down its management team by 30%, the company said Thursday during its first earnings call with new CEO Robert Feurle. Chairman Tom Werner said the company is still working with lenders ""to address our capital structure so that Wolfspeed has a strong financial foundation."" Executives didn't take questions from analysts.CFO Neill Reynolds, on the earnings call, said Wolfspeed will start naming the risk of continuing as a ""going concern"" in future filings as it negotiates with creditors, possibly in court.Wolfspeed shares plunged 26% to $3.30 Friday. The stock has traded as high as about $7.50 this year and as low as about $2.50. Shares have lost more than 80% in the past 12 months.William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer suspended coverage of the company, withdrawing the firm's previous Market Perform rating.Others stuck with coverage but downgraded the shares.""Wolfspeed faces significant financial challenges in a sluggish macro environment with financial losses, high leverage, Chips Act funding challenges underpinning doubts over going concern,"" said Atif Malik, an analyst at Citigroup. The bank cut its target price to $3 from $7 and downgraded the stock to Sell.J.P. Morgan analysts Samik Chatterjee and Joseph Cardoso downgraded the stock to Underweight in a note Friday morning, without giving a price target. It will be hard for the company to reach its goal of generating positive cash flow in the coming fiscal year, they wrote.Over at Charter Equity Research, analyst Jack Egan rates the shares Market Underperform. ""Difficulties refinancing the debt, continued cash burn and slowing demand in materials increased the specter of bankruptcy and will depress the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Egan wrote.Piper Sandler analysts led by Harsh Kumar weren't as pessimistic, but did move their price target to $6 after the results. ""WOLF has many steps ahead of itself to complete its turnaround but is course-correcting appropriately at this time,"" they wrote in a note.Wolfspeed competes with chip makers like Alpha & Omega and Indie Semiconductor, both of whose shares rose Friday. All are substantially smaller than well-known chip companies such as Nvidia, Intel, and Broadcom.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

CRDO Tanks 33% in 3 Months: Should You Hold the Stock or Make an Exit?,1746798420000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd CRDO stock has slipped 33.3% over the past three months, significantly more than the Electronic-Semiconductors industry’s decline of 16.4%. The broader Computer and Technology sector and S&P 500 Composite have registered declines of 11.5% and 7.8%, respectively, over the same time frame. The markets since April have been affected by evolving U.S. trade policy and diminishing macroeconomic visibility. Price PerformanceCRDO gained 6.1% yesterday and closed trading at $51.39, but the stock is down 41% below its 52-week high of $86.69. This is likely to spook investors as they contemplate how to strategize their investment now. The natural question is: Should you stay invested or exit now? Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this AI stock and see whether it is worth staying invested or not.AI Boom to Drive CRDO Top LineCredo is a provider of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the data infrastructure market. Amid exponential data growth and rapid AI proliferation, market demand for faster and energy-efficient connectivity solutions continues to increase. This bodes well for Credo.One of Credo’s key strengths lies in its Active Electrical Cables (AEC) product line, which posted triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The growth is driven by its increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.CRDO Focuses on Product LaunchesCredo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include a portfolio of PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. The company expects the PCIe products to considerably expand its total addressable market. This expansion into PCIe connectivity further solidifies the company's competitive positioning in the high-performance computing and AI markets.Momentum in the optical business, particularly for Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. In April 2025, CRDO unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.Growing Demand for RetimersCRDO’s PCIe retimers and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo Technology for significant future revenue growth. CRDO Provides Strong Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO reported $135 million in revenues, up 87% sequentially and 154% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%. This surge was mainly driven by its largest hyperscale customer, which significantly scaled the production of AI platforms, reflecting the growing demand for AI-powered connectivity solutions.Challenges Aplenty for CRDODespite Credo’s strong performance and innovative solutions, several challenges pose headwinds to its prospects. CRDO’s business is heavily tilted toward AI-related infrastructure and the hyperscale cloud market spending. While these segments are currently experiencing high growth, they are also cyclically dependent on AI capex spending, which could decelerate after initial buildouts.Credo’s non-GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter surged 16% sequentially to $43.8 million, primarily due to higher headcount. Increasing costs could become a problem if the revenue growth does not keep pace.In the last reported quarter, 86% of revenue came from a single end customer. This intense customer concentration risk can impact revenues as the company becomes highly vulnerable to the loss of business from those clients. To diversify its base, CRDO added that it has two additional hyperscalers in qualification and has already achieved volume production with three others. The company expects to ramp up with these two hyperscalers in fiscal 2026.These factors, along with increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties, may impact CRDO’s growth trajectory. Credo competes with semiconductor giants like Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc . MRVL.Analysts also seem wary as reflected in unchanged revisions for earnings estimates in the past 60 days. CRDO Falls Steeper Than PeersCRDO’s 33.3% decline is also much steeper than peers like Broadcom and Cirrus Logic, Inc .

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

These 4 Top Investors Bought Over 6 Million Broadcom Shares in Q1,1747922400000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO is one of just 10 stocks globally with a market cap over $1 trillion as of May 21. This makes it one of the most closely watched stocks in the market. Retail investors and famous money managers have come to know this company well. It has played a key role in the AI infrastructure buildout, which has been driving the market higher for some time.Many big investors bought Broadcom in large amounts in Q1. This became clear when they released their 13F filings . That makes a good deal of sense, considering that Broadcom shares fell by more than 27% in Q1. The analysis below will detail some of the highest-profile investors who bought Broadcom in spades. It is important to note that the data on these purchases only extends to March 31. Thus, these investors could have sold or bought more Broadcom shares since. Still, knowing how investors felt about Broadcom and similar companies in Q1 can help retail investors understand how to view the stock going forward.AI Bubble Bear Grantham Owned Nearly 14x More AVGO Than NVIDIA in Q1A huge purchaser of Broadcom in Q1 was investor Jeremy Grantham. Grantham co-founded Grantham, May and Van Otterloo (GMO) and is the company’s long-term investment strategist. Grantham is often considered a contrarian investor, pushing back against overzealous market trends. Many consider him to have predicted the dot-com bubble around two years before it popped. Despite Grantham’s claims that AI investing is a bubble, Grantham’s GMO bought over 1.5 million shares of Broadcom in Q1. Additionally, many of the firm's biggest holdings are among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have invested tens of billions in AI infrastructure.Still, the big decline in Broadcom shares in Q1 could back up Grantham’s claims that the AI bubble would deflate. As of the May 21 close, Broadcom is trading only around 6% below its 2025 high. Assuming the stock stays near this level through the end of Q2, seeing GMO greatly reduce its Broadcom holdings in its Q2 13F would be a logical next step. This would indicate he actually sees Broadcom as part of the AI bubble and simply took advantage of it temporarily deflating in Q1. Interestingly, Grantham has just a $21 million position in NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , versus $291 million in Broadcom. Sure, NVIDIA only fell 19% in Q1, but this positioning indicates Grantham sees Broadcom as a relatively better value .Renaissance, Two Sigma, and Dalio Buy Over 5 Million Broadcom Shares CombinedAnother massive high-profile Broadcom buyer in Q1 was Renaissance Technologies , an investment firm many regard as the most successful hedge fund of all time. Renaissance purchased over 2.4 million shares of Broadcom in Q1, massively increasing the firm’s stake in the company. Renaissance is notoriously tight-lipped about its thoughts on the market, making it difficult to assert its thinking. However, depending on the data points looked at, one could argue that Renaissance may or may not still see value in Broadcom shares. [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Two Sigma Advisors and Bridgewater Associates are other notable investment companies that bought significant shares of Broadcom in Q1. They bought around 2.5 million and 280,000 shares, respectively. Two Sigma has become known as one of the pioneers of quantitative investing, relying largely on complex math and non-traditional data to invest. For many, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio needs no introduction. He is a prolific author, investing thought leader, and has built what was, at one time, the largest hedge fund in the world.At the end of Q1, Two Sigma held 3.9 million shares of Broadcom. The company hasn’t had even close to this big of a position since Q3 2024, when it held 3.6 million shares. Notably, Broadcom’s average closing price during that period was just $159. In Q1, that figure was $211. The company held more shares in Q1, when the average closing price was about 33% higher. This suggests it thinks Broadcom's intrinsic value has increased very significantly. However, whether it sees value in prices near $230 or higher is more questionable.Broadcom’s Big Gain in Q2 Could Reveal These Investors' True ThoughtsSince Broadcom’s shares now only trade marginally lower than their 2025 peak , these investors' next 13F filings could reveal at what price they are comfortable holding shares.If Broadcom remains near the $230 mark through the rest of Q2, continuing to hold their shares could indicate these investors see potential for the stock to test all-time highs near $250.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f0037420b094b:0-these-4-top-investors-bought-over-6-million-broadcom-shares-in-q1/

In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Case for AVGOBroadcom is a diversified semiconductor company with a strong presence in AI chip development space. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. These hyperscalers are significantly ramping up investment in their next-generation frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators and AI data centers with larger clusters. AVGO noted that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Consequently, AVGO’s Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Apart from these three customers, AVGO is also working with four other hyperscalers to aid them in building their own customized AI accelerators.XPUs are necessary to train Generative AI (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. Its next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. AVGO is now planning to tape out the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.In the last reported quarter, semiconductor solutions revenues (55% of net revenues) totaled $8.2 billion, rising 11% year over year, driven by strong AI semiconductor revenues. AI-related revenues grew 77% year over year to $4.1 billion, which was a major driver of overall revenue growth. This growth was driven by higher shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers for AI applications.For second-quarter fiscal 2025, Broadcom expects revenues of $14.9 billion, while AI semiconductor revenues are projected to grow 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow 17% year over year to $8.4 billion.Price Performance and Valuation for CRDO & AVGOOver the past month, CRDO and AVGO have registered gains of 67.8% and 36.3%, respectively.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 15.50X, lower than AVGO’s 16.05X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO?Analysts have kept their earnings estimates unchanged for CRDO’s bottom line in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, for AVGO, there is a marginal upward estimate revision.CRDO or AVGO: Which is a Better Pick?Both CRDO and MRVL are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI driven data center market. CRDO at present flaunts a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Consequently, in terms of Zacks Rank, AVGO seems to be a better pick at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70a692c5f094b:0-crdo-vs-avgo-which-ai-focused-semiconductor-stock-is-the-better-buy/
"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015.

"Market Chatter: Intel Considers Divesting Networking, Edge Businesses",1747733728000,"Intel NASDAQ:INTC has contemplated selling its network and edge businesses, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter. The chipmaker is considering a potential sale because the businesses in its former NEX group no longer seem relevant to the focus that Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan has adopted for the company, two sources told the news agency. The unit will no longer help Intel's core strategy, Reuters reported, citing a source. The company may sell its networking business because Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and other firms have a tight grip on key parts of that market, according to the report. Intel has not yet launched a formal deal process for the unit, or solicited bidders, Reuters reported, citing two sources. The company recently interviewed investment bankers to pick an adviser for the sales process, though it has not yet hired a banker, according to the report.

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"
Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals — Barrons.com,1747634400000,"By Tae KimAmid the gold rush to build data centers and AI models, Nvidia has sold the most sought-after tools, driving triple-digit annual sales growth and turning the company into a $3 trillion market value giant.For the most part, Nvidia sells a ""full-stack AI solution"" that includes computer processors, or CPUs, networking equipment, and the AI accelerator, also known as the GPU. It's inside an Nvidia-designed server rack. Together, these components helped to train and serve new AI models.But now Nvidia is taking a significant step toward opening its platform, allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chip. It offers the option for future Nvidia racks with, say, Nvidia and Qualcomm chips inside.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the move on Monday at the COMPUTEX trade show in Taiwan. The new system is called NVLink Fusion.""A tectonic shift is under way: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected — AI is being fused into every computing platform,"" Huang said. ""NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures.""Nvidia's current top-of-the-line GB200 NVL72 AI server rack system includes Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.Initial NVLink Fusion AI chip partners include MediaTek, Marvell, and AIchip. Fujitsu and Qualcomm are the initial CPU partners.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack scale architecture, we're advancing our vision of high-performance, energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Qualcomm Technologies CEO Cristiano Amon said in a press release.The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's ecosystem when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology.For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its server platform and to drive more revenue.There's one catch: Broadcom, which makes many of the custom AI chips for large tech companies, wasn't on Nvidia's initial partner list, though the company said more partners could be added in the future.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

QCOM Unveils Advanced Snapdragon 7 Chipset: Should You Buy the Stock?,1747419780000,"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QCOM recently introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. One of the significant improvements in the new platform is a 65% improvement in AI performance. This will ensure seamless support for various large language models, generative AI assistants and stable diffusion image generation on smartphones. A 30% faster GPU rendering will facilitate improved framerates and smoother gameplay. To improve the gaming experience, the company has included Snapdragon Elite Gaming features into the platform. 27% improvement in CPU performance will ensure seamless multitasking and enhanced system responsiveness.Qualcomm has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs such as HONOR and vivo have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.The solution brings several multimedia capabilities. New camera capabilities include video super resolution, hardware electronic image stabilization and advanced image processing features. The 3GPP release 17 for 5G, along with support for WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0, ensures seamless connectivity. Moreover, support for Snapdragon Sound technology, including Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network technology, ensures premium wireless audio quality.Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series is used primarily in mid-range smartphones. Availability of advanced camera capabilities, action-packed gaming and advanced on-device AI in the Snapdragon 7 series chip set will be a game changer for mid-range smartphone users.QCOM Rides on Portfolio Strength, Innovation and AI FocusThe company has ramped up its efforts to solidify its position in the rapidly growing AI domain. QCOM took the market by storm with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs, Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions. Qualcomm is also witnessing solid market traction in the automotive business. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, automotive revenues rose 59% to $959 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform.These developments suggest Qualcomm is moving beyond the smartphone industry by diversifying its portfolio and venturing into new high-growth verticals such as AI PC, AI data centers, automotive and edge AI industrial IoT technologies and solutions. Its strategy of continuous innovation and portfolio diversification will likely boost commercial prospects.Major Challenges for QCOMSamsung and Apple, Inc. AAPL, which have been major buyers of Qualcomm chips for several years, are now moving toward in-house chip development. Samsung has launched several mobile chips under its Exynos lineup, which are used in both the mid-range and premium smartphone segments. Apple has also introduced several chips for its smartphone and PC products. The company uses the A18 Pro chip for the iPhone 16 Pro series and the A18 for iPhone 16 models. Moreover, in the iPhone 16e model, Apple has replaced the Qualcomm modem previously used in iPhone 15 models with an in-house C1 modem. Such initiatives from long-standing customers are a major concern for Qualcomm.The company is also facing intense competition from MediaTek in the mid-range smartphone segment. In the network space, the company faces competition from Broadcom Inc. AVGO. Despite some major issues, Intel Corporation INTC continues to be the dominant player in the PC market. With innovative launches such as Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors, the company is gaining strong momentum in the AI PC domain. Despite enhanced power efficiency and connectivity of Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, Qualcomm has to match the seamless compatibility that Intel processors offer with existing software to gain a competitive edge. This is a complex endeavor.Qualcomm has an extensive presence in China. Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can significantly impact its operations. However, following negotiations, both the United States and China have decided to temporarily reduce tariffs. If they fail to reach a resolution within this period, tariffs may rise again. This will negatively impact QCOM’s operating margin.Price PerformanceQCOM shares have declined 21% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 20.7%. The company has outperformed Intel but underperformed relative to Broadcom. Intel has declined 32.7%, while Broadcom has surged 64.7%.Estimate Revision Trend of QCOMEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 0.34% to $11.8 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has decreased 1.85% to $12.21. This portrays mixed sentiments about the stock’s growth potential from investors.End NoteQualcomm intends to be the driving force in the next wave of AI innovations. The company’s effort to broaden its market reach beyond the mobile chipset market is an important step toward that direction. The future of AI innovation is not concentrated in a particular sector, but it is dispersed across a vast ecosystem. Hence, Qualcomm’s multi-dimensional approach is creating new revenue-generating opportunities in automotive, industrial IoT, data center, and edge AI domains while also strengthening its leadership position in the mobile chipset industry.However, aggressive competition in the smartphone chipset market and several of QCOM’s client strategy of in-house chip development are likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High exposure to the demanding environment of China is a major concern. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia and Broadcom",1747382280000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO.3 Reasons U.S. Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Broadcom vs. Marvell: Which Semiconductor Stock Has Greater Upside?,1747324080000,"Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL are key providers of semiconductor solutions for end markets, including AI-powered data centers and cloud service providers. Both offer custom AI accelerators (XPUs) that power AI deployment. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expects a double-digit growth rate in 2025, with semiconductor sales surging 19.1% to $627.6 billion in 2024. This offers significant growth opportunities for both Broadcom and Marvell.However, both AVGO and MRVL have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions amid tariff-related uncertainties. While Broadcom shares have climbed a modest 0.1% year to date, Marvell shares plunged 40.3%.AVGO and MRVL Stock’s PerformanceSo, Broadcom or Marvell, which is a better buy amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop? Let’s find out.Broadcom Rides on Strong Demand for XPUsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.MRVL’s Growing Data Center and Networking Market is PositiveMarvell’s custom AI silicon and electro-optics solutions have enabled it to become a leading player in the high-performance computing space. The company is benefiting from hyperscalers’ ramping up their use of custom silicon for AI workloads. In fiscal 2025, AI-based revenues crossed its $1.5 billion target, and Marvell expects to “very significantly” surpass its $2.5 billion AI revenue target in fiscal 2026. Marvell’s management is confident that revenues from its custom XPU solutions will continue expanding in fiscal 2027 and beyond.As AI workloads grow, data centers need enhanced networking and interconnect products. MRVL is capitalizing on this shift with its high-speed optical interconnects, including 800G PAM, 400ZR DCI, and its industry-first 1.6T PAM DSP (digital signal processor), which cuts down on optical module power usage by 20%.Furthermore, the shift from copper to optical connectivity in AI infrastructure represents a massive growth opportunity for the company. MRVL’s Co-Packaged Optics technology and its development of the industry's first 2nm silicon IP for cloud and AI workloads solidify its position in the next-generation networking space.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, MRVL’s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc. Price and ConsensusBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. QuoteHowever, the consensus mark for Marvell’s fiscal 2026 earnings has declined by a penny to $2.76 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 75.16% growth over fiscal 2025.Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMarvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. QuoteBoth AVGO’s and MRVL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Marvell’s average surprise of 4.25% is better than AVGO’s surprise of 3.44%, reflecting a good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: MRVL is Cheaper Than AVGOBoth Marvell and Broadcom are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Marvell shares are trading at 6.54X, lower than AVGO’s 16.12X.MRVL and AVGO ValuationAVGO is a Better Buy Right NowBroadcom’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential. Marvell’s near-term prospects are dull, as customers are rescheduling orders to manage excess chip inventories. The U.S. government’s export restriction on certain Chinese customers is likely to continue to be an overhang on Marvell’s top line.Currently, Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared with Marvell, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Broadcom Set to Surge as AI Diffusion Rule Ends,1747316880000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Over approximately the last three weeks, markets have been on the rise big-time. The  S&P 500 closed just under $5,900 on May 14, just around 4% lower than the all-time high it reached in February. As market sentiment shifts, Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , a leading semiconductor stock , has emerged as a top beneficiary. Despite at one point being down nearly 38% in 2025, Broadcom is now just slightly in the green this year as of the May 14 close.The announcement of the trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted the stock. Shares jumped almost 12% within two days after the announcement. However, there were other highly positive recent pieces of news for Broadcom that the trade deal may somewhat overshadow.Most notable is that President Trump is ending the Biden-era “AI Diffusion Rule."" Its end has the potential to substantially benefit companies like Broadcom . So, what exactly was the AI Diffusion Rule , and what does its cancellation mean for Broadcom?Understanding the End of AI Diffusion, NVIDIA and AMD See Immediate BenefitThe purpose of the AI Diffusion Rule was to give the U.S. government extensive control over which countries can and cannot get access to advanced AI chips made by American firms . Specifically, it controls chips used to train advanced AI models.The rule categorized countries into three different tiers. Tier 1 countries included many of America’s closest allies. These countries face no restrictions. Tier 2 countries include most other countries. India, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were notable inclusions.These countries were limited in the number of chips they could buy. Tier 3 countries , which include adversaries like China and Russia, were not allowed to buy any advanced chips.Really, the government was trying to specifically prevent China and Russia from getting these chips to slow the advancement of their AI capabilities. With the ending of AI Diffusion , that isn’t likely to change. However, how the United States treats those Tier 2 countries is changing. NVIDIA's NASDAQ:NVDA announcement that it would sell 18,000 of its most advanced chips to Saudi Arabia on the same day the government eliminated the AI Diffusion rule provides evidence of this.Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a huge AI partnership in the country.Overall, the end of AI Diffusion means that chip companies with significant AI capabilities now have a much larger opportunity to sell their most advanced technology to these Tier 2 countries. Many of these countries are extremely wealthy, adding to the size of the opportunity . This extends to Broadcom, but in a slightly different way than NVIDIA and AMD.The End of AI Diffusion: Broadcom Waits Its Turn to CapitalizeBroadcom's custom chips are largely used for AI model inference, rather than primarily for AI model training. Training comes before inference. For countries like Saudi Arabia, this means they need time to train their models with NVIDIA and AMD chips . After that, Broadcom's chips can really make a difference. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO]Thus, the fact that NVIDIA and AMD are striking deals opens up the door for Broadcom to sell large amounts of chips to Tier 2 countries down the line. How long that might take is hard to say, but a big opportunity now exists for Broadcom nonetheless.The benefit to Broadcom comes even though the company hasn’t expressed concerns about AI Diffusion, at least with a specific set of customers. In the company’s last earnings call , Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon specifically asked about this.Rasgon asked whether AI diffusion would impact Broadcom’s design wins or shipments for the three big AI customers the firm is selling to in volume.In response, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said, “To answer your question directly, no, we don't have any concerns."" This underscores Broadcom’s focus on inference chips , which AI Diffusion did not directly impact. However, they were indirectly impacted because training comes before inference. So, with AI Diffusion ending, the positive impact on Broadcom comes from the expansion of its serviceable market.The End of AI Diffusion Adds Another Broadcom TailwindFor the reasons discussed above, Broadcom can win big due to AI Diffusion ending . Its chips now have a strong path forward to getting into the hands of some of these huge Tier 2 countries. But, cashing in will likely take time.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:bbce48cea094b:0-broadcom-set-to-surge-as-ai-diffusion-rule-ends/

Why Shares Are Suddenly Surging. — Barrons.com,1747234200000,"By Brian SwintWolfspeed, the semiconductor firm that is trying to restructure its debt, looked set to rise for a third consecutive day Wednesday after a report that negotiations among creditors are happening.Apollo Global Management, one of the biggest holders of Wolfspeed's $6.5 billion of debt, is in talks with investment bank Moelis about a restructuring, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The stock plunged 26% Friday after the company said that it faces the risk of not being able to continue as a ""going concern"" on its latest earnings call.Wolfspeed rose 0.5% to $3.89 in Wednesday morning trading after gaining 16% on Tuesday and 1.8% Monday. Coming into the session, it was down almost 6% over the past five days and 42% lower in 2025.Wolfspeed makes silicon-carbide technology for use in the automotive industry and would stand to benefit from renewed interest in chips and artificial intelligence. Its problem is that it was due for funding under President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act that now looks doubtful under President Donald Trump. It has been one of the most shorted stocks on the market this year--short selling is when traders bet that the price of shares will fall.Other chip stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Big names Nvidia, AMD, and Arm were all rising, while others such as Broadcom and Intel were lower. Smaller chip maker Alpha & Omega was falling while peer Indie Semiconductor was rising. The Nasdaq was up 0.4%.Wolfspeed didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Quality Growth Stocks Make Sense for an Uncertain Economy — Barrons.com,1747164480000,"By Jacob SonenshineThis time is a little different.When the market rallies, investors usually want to own the riskiest stocks. But right now, the winning formula has changed: The best names to buy are good-quality companies that also have high potential for growth.The S&P 500 is up 17% from the low point it hit in its nasty decline in April. Areas that lost the most when expectations about the economy soured have led the way, rebounding faster as the picture has brightened. The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce sky-high tariffs that were choking off trade between the countries, and the White House has indicated that deals with other countries are on the way.That would mean reduced tariffs, less inflation, and more spending by consumers and businesses.At this point, investors looking for stocks to buy at today's prices should avoid economically sensitive, riskier industries such as retail, restaurants, or financials. They are now a hair above their levels just before President Donald Trump unveiled surprisingly high tariffs against a wide range of countries in early April, meaning they are no longer reflecting much potential economic weakness.Yet harder times are still a possibility. While Trump has partially rolled back tariffs, a 10% baseline tariff rate remains in place. Interest rates, all the while, have remained around 4%, where they have now hovered across various maturities for a few years . High rates take time to push consumer spending down, so that is a continuing source of pressure on consumers.Economic growth is more likely to slow down than to significantly accelerate.Given all that, strategists at UBS screened for higher-quality companies that can increase their earnings regardless, reasoning those stocks are likely to perform best as the economy adjusts to President Donald Trump's trade war.The bank looked for companies with four qualities. They had to have a market capitalization of at least $10 billion, higher expected earnings growth than most publicly traded companies, and trade at forward price/earnings multiples closer to their historical averages than most stocks. Finally, companies had to be of higher ""operational quality"" than most businesses.The latter means they have characteristics that enable them to consistently increase earnings. Those include pricing power — the ability to lift prices without damaging demand — and high profit margins, which insulate a company from losing money during recessions.Stocks that make the cut can be expected to offer growth at a reasonable price, or GARP. UBS's screen yielded six names: Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company; Broadcom; Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks; Cintas, which supplies uniforms and cleaning supplies to businesses; Heico, the dominant maker of aircraft parts; and Salesforce, the provider of cloud-based sales software.Analysts expect sales at Salesforce to rise by just over 9% annually to $49.1 billion by 2027, according to FactSet. If the economy stumbles, some customers may scale back their investments in new cloud-based technologies as they watch their budgets, but any cuts are likely to be mild. Companies need the newest, fastest, and most cost efficient technologies to make the most of sales opportunities.That is where Salesforce comes in. Its artificial intelligence agents give customers a reason to pay higher subscription prices for its software products, so its revenue growth is higher than for the average S&P 500 company.If the company remains disciplined with costs, that would help profit margins increase, sending earnings per share up about 13% annually over the coming three years, according to FactSet. That compares with the 11% in growth in the aggregate earnings expected for companies in the S&P 500.That kind of profit growth would likely push the stock higher because its price/earnings ratio isn't likely to drop much from its current level. Salesforce trades at about 25 times the earnings per share expected for the coming 12 months, about 14 points below its five-year average of about 39 times. The S&P 500 sells for 21 times, compared with the five-year average of 20 times.Buy GARP stocks. They are just a better deal than the ones that are, well, the riskiest.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

NYSE:NET , the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application.AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.Palo Alto Networks® NASDAQ:PANW , the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations.Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete. The best-selling platform surged past $1 billion cumulative bookings in FY25 Q2, making it our fastest offering to reach this milestone. Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks doubled down on cloud security with the introduction of Cortex Cloud, converging its industry-leading CNAPP and CDR capabilities on the unified Cortex platform.Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) recently announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats.Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries.CrowdStrike NASDAQ:CRWD recently released its 2025 State of SMB Cybersecurity Report, uncovering a widening gap between cybersecurity awareness and readiness among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While 93% of SMBs consider themselves knowledgeable about cybersecurity risks and 83% report having a plan in place, just 36% are investing in new tools – and only 11% have adopted AI-powered defenses.Based on insights from SMB decision-makers across industries and company sizes, the research reveals that despite rising awareness, most SMBs still lack the budget, tools and in-house expertise to stop modern threats. With attacks becoming more advanced and frequent, SMBs need protection that’s easy to use, affordable to deploy and built to scale with their business.About FN Media Group:At FN Media Group, via our top-rated online news portal at www.financialnewsmedia.com, we are one of the very few select firms providing top tier one syndicated news distribution, targeted ticker tag press releases and stock market news coverage for today’s emerging companies. #tickertagpressreleases #pressreleasesFollow us on Facebook to receive the latest news updates: https://www.facebook.com/financialnewsmediaFollow us on Twitter for real time Market News: https://twitter.com/FNMgroupFollow us on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/financialnewsmedia/DISCLAIMER: FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates Financialnewsmedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.

"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia. ""Everything needs an accelerator,"" they wrote.

Micron vs. Broadcom: Which Stock is the Smarter Semiconductor Bet?,1747058760000,"Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO are both entrenched in high-growth semiconductor arenas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and cloud infrastructure, but they take radically different paths to capture value. Micron is a dominant memory chip maker, while Broadcom specializes in networking, custom silicon and infrastructure software.Both companies have seen share price fluctuations in 2025 amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While MU shares have risen 2% year to date, AVGO dropped 10.2%. Yet with AI adoption accelerating, which stock stands out as the smarter semiconductor investment today? Let’s find out.Micron: AI Memory Boom Aids, Margin Worries LingerMicron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, Micron revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Despite Micron's efforts to capitalize on rising AI-related demand, margin pressures and pricing challenges raise red flags. While Micron’s top-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was impressive, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Broadcom: Profitable, Predictable and Primed for AIMeanwhile, Broadcom offers investors a more diversified and durable growth profile. The company is deeply embedded in next-generation AI infrastructure through its custom application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) and high-performance networking chips, which are fueling its top-line growth.Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require a complex integration of compute, memory and I/O capabilities to achieve the essential performance at lower power consumption and costs. Broadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion.What’s more impressive is that Broadcom is already sampling the world’s first 3nm XPU chips and plans to launch a 2nm version using advanced 3.5D packaging later this year. The company targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. It believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric.Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Super Micro Computer, has been a key catalyst.From a financial perspective, Broadcom consistently delivers gross margins above 70% and operating margins above 60%, driven by its high-value custom silicon business and enterprise software portfolio. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP EPS soared 45.5% on 25% higher revenues. Looking forward, Broadcom expects total revenues in the second quarter to surge 19% year over year to $14.9 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: MU Picks Up Steam, AVGO Holds SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Micron’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 41% and 433%, respectively. However, the estimate revision trend for MU’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS has remained highly volatile.Micron EPS Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 21% and 36%, respectively. However, unlike Micron, estimates for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS have demonstrated a steady upward revision trend. This stability is a testament to the company’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.Broadcom EPS Estimate Revision TrendValuation: MU is Cheaper, but AVGO Deserves the PremiumMicron is trading at a forward sales multiple of 2.24X, way below Broadcom’s 14.48X.Broadcom does seem pricey compared to Micron. However, AVGO’s higher valuation is backed by superior profitability and a structurally more diversified business. The company boasts steady gross and operating margins compared to MU’s more variable margin profile.Micron’s falling profitability raises questions about its ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Conclusion: Broadcom is the Better Long-Term PlayBoth Micron and Broadcom are riding the same megatrends — AI, cloud and data centers — but they’re doing so from vastly different positions of strength.Micron has upside potential due to its leadership in AI memory. However, that promise is being weighed down by margin pressure and pricing volatility. It’s still a play on memory cycles more than a structural AI winner.Meanwhile, Broadcom brings more stability to the table with strong fundamentals, durable earnings, and a balanced mix of AI-driven hardware and enterprise software. While its valuation is higher, it’s supported by margin strength and earnings consistency.So, for investors seeking a smarter semiconductor bet amid global uncertainty, Broadcom remains the more compelling choice.Currently, AVGO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared to MU, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wolfspeed Stock Plunges as Analysts Weigh In. Chip Maker's Debt Is the Worry. — Barrons.com,1746805020000,"By Brian SwintShares of semiconductor maker Wolfspeed plunged Friday as Wall Street analysts issued negative research on the stock.Earnings that came in line with expectations weren't enough to reassure investors concerned with the company's debt levels.The problem is that Wolfspeed, which produces silicon wafers in the U.S., was promised $750 million under former President Joe Biden's Chips Act. Receiving it may be a problem as President Donald Trump tries to undo his predecessor's work. At the same time, the company has a $575 million payment due to creditors next year.Short interest in Wolfspeed, a measure of how much of a company's stock has been borrowed for bets that the price would drop, has taken off this year. The shares went through a short squeeze last month as investors bid up the stock price, forcing short sellers to buy to close out their bearish bets.Wolfspeed is slimming down its management team by 30%, the company said Thursday during its first earnings call with new CEO Robert Feurle. Chairman Tom Werner said the company is still working with lenders ""to address our capital structure so that Wolfspeed has a strong financial foundation."" Executives didn't take questions from analysts.CFO Neill Reynolds, on the earnings call, said Wolfspeed will start naming the risk of continuing as a ""going concern"" in future filings as it negotiates with creditors, possibly in court.Wolfspeed shares plunged 26% to $3.30 Friday. The stock has traded as high as about $7.50 this year and as low as about $2.50. Shares have lost more than 80% in the past 12 months.William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer suspended coverage of the company, withdrawing the firm's previous Market Perform rating.Others stuck with coverage but downgraded the shares.""Wolfspeed faces significant financial challenges in a sluggish macro environment with financial losses, high leverage, Chips Act funding challenges underpinning doubts over going concern,"" said Atif Malik, an analyst at Citigroup. The bank cut its target price to $3 from $7 and downgraded the stock to Sell.J.P. Morgan analysts Samik Chatterjee and Joseph Cardoso downgraded the stock to Underweight in a note Friday morning, without giving a price target. It will be hard for the company to reach its goal of generating positive cash flow in the coming fiscal year, they wrote.Over at Charter Equity Research, analyst Jack Egan rates the shares Market Underperform. ""Difficulties refinancing the debt, continued cash burn and slowing demand in materials increased the specter of bankruptcy and will depress the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Egan wrote.Piper Sandler analysts led by Harsh Kumar weren't as pessimistic, but did move their price target to $6 after the results. ""WOLF has many steps ahead of itself to complete its turnaround but is course-correcting appropriately at this time,"" they wrote in a note.Wolfspeed competes with chip makers like Alpha & Omega and Indie Semiconductor, both of whose shares rose Friday. All are substantially smaller than well-known chip companies such as Nvidia, Intel, and Broadcom.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

CRDO Tanks 33% in 3 Months: Should You Hold the Stock or Make an Exit?,1746798420000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd CRDO stock has slipped 33.3% over the past three months, significantly more than the Electronic-Semiconductors industry’s decline of 16.4%. The broader Computer and Technology sector and S&P 500 Composite have registered declines of 11.5% and 7.8%, respectively, over the same time frame. The markets since April have been affected by evolving U.S. trade policy and diminishing macroeconomic visibility. Price PerformanceCRDO gained 6.1% yesterday and closed trading at $51.39, but the stock is down 41% below its 52-week high of $86.69. This is likely to spook investors as they contemplate how to strategize their investment now. The natural question is: Should you stay invested or exit now? Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this AI stock and see whether it is worth staying invested or not.AI Boom to Drive CRDO Top LineCredo is a provider of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the data infrastructure market. Amid exponential data growth and rapid AI proliferation, market demand for faster and energy-efficient connectivity solutions continues to increase. This bodes well for Credo.One of Credo’s key strengths lies in its Active Electrical Cables (AEC) product line, which posted triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The growth is driven by its increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.CRDO Focuses on Product LaunchesCredo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include a portfolio of PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. The company expects the PCIe products to considerably expand its total addressable market. This expansion into PCIe connectivity further solidifies the company's competitive positioning in the high-performance computing and AI markets.Momentum in the optical business, particularly for Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. In April 2025, CRDO unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.Growing Demand for RetimersCRDO’s PCIe retimers and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo Technology for significant future revenue growth. CRDO Provides Strong Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO reported $135 million in revenues, up 87% sequentially and 154% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%. This surge was mainly driven by its largest hyperscale customer, which significantly scaled the production of AI platforms, reflecting the growing demand for AI-powered connectivity solutions.Challenges Aplenty for CRDODespite Credo’s strong performance and innovative solutions, several challenges pose headwinds to its prospects. CRDO’s business is heavily tilted toward AI-related infrastructure and the hyperscale cloud market spending. While these segments are currently experiencing high growth, they are also cyclically dependent on AI capex spending, which could decelerate after initial buildouts.Credo’s non-GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter surged 16% sequentially to $43.8 million, primarily due to higher headcount. Increasing costs could become a problem if the revenue growth does not keep pace.In the last reported quarter, 86% of revenue came from a single end customer. This intense customer concentration risk can impact revenues as the company becomes highly vulnerable to the loss of business from those clients. To diversify its base, CRDO added that it has two additional hyperscalers in qualification and has already achieved volume production with three others. The company expects to ramp up with these two hyperscalers in fiscal 2026.These factors, along with increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties, may impact CRDO’s growth trajectory. Credo competes with semiconductor giants like Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc . MRVL.Analysts also seem wary as reflected in unchanged revisions for earnings estimates in the past 60 days. CRDO Falls Steeper Than PeersCRDO’s 33.3% decline is also much steeper than peers like Broadcom and Cirrus Logic, Inc . CRUS. Broadcom and Cirrus Logic have declined 11.6% and 6.5%, respectively. However, Marvell’s stock has declined 48.9% in the same time frame. CRDO Trades at a PremiumCredo Technology stock is also not so cheap, as its Value Style Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 12.92, higher than the Electronic-Semiconductors sector’s multiple of 6.97.In comparison, Broadcom trades at a forward 12-month P/S multiple of 14.46, while Cirrus Logic and Marvell Technology are trading at a multiple of 2.76 and 5.71, respectively.Hold CRDO for NowWhile Credo appears well-positioned in the AI-driven connectivity space, there are several factors that could exert downward pressure on the stock. Key concerns include customer concentration, competitive pressures, stretched valuation, and overreliance on AI spending.CRDO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5a0015f9b094b:0-crdo-tanks-33-in-3-months-should-you-hold-the-stock-or-make-an-exit/

Nvidia and 29 Other Stocks to Play AI — Barrons.com,1746732720000,"By Teresa RivasWhile tariffs have caused tech stocks to bend, they won't break, a longtime bull says. It's all thanks to artificial intelligence.The technology sector has been one of the harder-hit areas during the 2025 market downturn. Even as stocks have started to rebound amid hopes for tariff negotiations, the Nasdaq Composite is still down more than 8% year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's loss, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund is off some 13%.Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that tech's underdog status won't last. Perhaps most obviously, the artificial intelligence genie can't be put back in the bottle. AI is becoming increasingly mainstream, whether it's people talking to chatbots, retailers using it to personalize their promotional efforts, or companies hoping to improve efficiency and productivity.In short, the AI revolution will continue to play out for years to come. That's the stance of Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime tech bull. He calls AI the fourth industrial revolution in a new note Thursday, arguing that ""it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.""That creates an opportunity for multiple companies — and their investors — to win. He highlights 30 tech companies that he says will be long-term winners across six areas: hyperscalers, software, consumer internet, cybersecurity, autonomous and robotics, and semiconductors and hardware.Often thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" of AI, semiconductors and hardware makers are the second largest group in his list. They have also been some of the most well-known AI beneficiaries, including Nvidia — Ives calls co-founder Jensen Huang the ""godfather of AI.""Naturally Ives still likes the stock, along with Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. He says AMD will continue to strengthen its position and gain market share, and Taiwan Semi — the world's leading chip foundry — will make it a beneficiary of the global increase in AI investments. In addition, Micron has ""an enviable position within memory,"" while Broadcom, the world leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cloud and AI, will benefit from the buildout of these technologies.More than 15% of cloud services now include some AI component, making hyperscalers another area of huge investments. Major companies in the space ""are expected to spend $325 billion+ in 2025 through AI capital expenditures, representing 40% year-over-year growth and over $100 billion year-over-year increase as data center buildouts continue with the AI Arms Race only just beginning,"" Ives writes."" Microsoft is currently in the driver's seat,"" he says, adding that Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, and Oracle aren't far behind.With both people and businesses ramping up their use of AI, consumer internet companies stand to benefit, too, Ives says. Positives could include AI customer service, to improved search, personalization of ads, and dynamic pricing.His favorite picks stateside are Apple — he estimates about a quarter of the world's population will eventually access AI through an Apple device — and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is still seeing strong underlying demand. Among Chinese stocks, he highlights Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu. It's becoming ""clearer [Alibaba] could be one of the winners in the China AI Arms Race,"" he writes, while Baidu is another major Chinese player poised to do well.Robotics is another key area, as the ""global autonomous vehicle market size is expected to reach $3.22 trillion by 2033 representing a 36% compound annual growth rate,"" Ives writes. Tesla's robo-taxis earn it a spot here, while nuclear energy start-up Oklo will help meet the increasing power demands of automation.Of course, all of these advancements make cybersecurity more important than ever. Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and CyberArk Software are his picks here.Software is the largest category, as 1 billion apps will be with generative AI by 2028, Ive says, noting ""the software era of AI use cases [is] already under way."" Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, IBM, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Adobe, Pegasystems, MongoDB, C3.ai, Elastic, Innodata, and SoundHound are on his list of winners.Tariffs remain a worry, though Ives predicts they won't dent the AI revolution in the long run.He isn't the only optimist on this front. 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere writes Thursday that investors will likely return to megacap tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven because the U.S. economy will likely avoid a recession, though it might slow.""High-quality, monopolistic companies with strong earnings momentum are favorable in our base case of an economic muddle through, especially after large price drawdowns,"" he writes.Time to ask ChatGPT if tech is cheap enough to buy the dip.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Chips Stocks Rise as U.S. Plans to Overhaul Curbs on AI Chip Exports,1746716580000,"By Kelly CloonanChip stocks rose across the board as the Trump administration plans to overhaul export regulations on U.S. chip companies.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.8% to $104.20 on Thursday. Intel rose 2.3%, while Qualcomm and Broadcom both ticked up around 1%. Nvidia shares remained flat.The Commerce Department plans to replace a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips countries like India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel can buy, a spokeswoman said.The rule, commonly known as AI diffusion, had been set to go into effect May 15. It aimed to prevent other countries from routing U.S. chips to adversaries like China, but was seen as controversial across the tech industry. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle argued it would harm American companies' business prospects abroad without doing much to hinder China.Other regulations appear to remain for now, though. The Trump administration recently issued new export-licensing requirements covering Nvidia's H20 chips, which the company said would result in a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings. AMD's MI308 processors also are affected, with the company expecting charges of $800 million.Write to Kelly Cloonan at kelly.cloonan@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010812:0-chips-stocks-rise-as-u-s-plans-to-overhaul-curbs-on-ai-chip-exports/
Nvidia Stock Wavers as Trump Plans to Scrap Biden's Chip-Export Rules — Barrons.com,1746716340000,"Adam ClarkNvidia and other semiconductor stocks were rising Thursday as the Trump administration said it plans to scrap regulations that would limit exports of artificial-intelligence chips worldwide.Nvidia shares were down 0.3% at $116.71 in Thursday morning trading, after gaining more than 3% the previous day. Advanced Micro Devices stock was gaining 2.6%, and Broadcom stock was rising 0.4%.Chip makers were rising after the Commerce Department said Wednesday afternoon that it doesn't intend to implement AI processor restrictions drawn up under the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported . The curbs were set to go into effect on May 15 and would have limited sales more widely than existing sanctions on exports to China.The so-called ""AI diffusion"" rules were expected to reduce the long-term market for AI chips by as much as 10%, according to analysts at BofA Securities.""We welcome the administration's leadership and new direction on AI policy. With the AI Diffusion Rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, "" Nvidia said in an emailed statement.However, it isn't clear if the overhaul will lead to alternative rules on chip exports, which could potentially be even more onerous. The White House has considered including AI-processor limits as part of bilateral agreements with individual countries, according to the report.More information could come with President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Middle East next week, where AI chip exports are likely to be on the agenda.""We generally expect that Trump will increase the total of chips allowed to be sold globally, starting with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but this could also come with more enforcement to prevent the diversion of banned chips to China,"" wrote Raymond James analyst Ed Mills in a research note.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Top U.S. Firms May Set the Course for Productivity,1746715260000,"By Matt GrossmanNew analysis suggests that cutting-edge tech giants and other standout companies have pushed the economy forward more than previously understood.In a new paper, researchers at McKinsey found that a relatively small handful of top businesses have done far more to accelerate workplace productivity than the vast sea of their competitors.Productivity measures how much workers accomplish, on average, during a standard shift: an important variable in determining whether the economy can thrive and grow without generating inflation.Many economists have figured that America's solid productivity improvements in the past decade grew out of a massive agglomeration of tiny tweaks at millions of businesses. In fact, what happens inside some of the U.S.'s megacaps likely weighs quite a bit heavier, according to McKinsey.Researchers at the consulting firm's internal research arm studied how much each of a set of more than 8,000 firms in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany added to the overall group's productivity between 2011 and 2019. They found in a report published Wednesday that in the U.S., just 5% of companies contributed 78% of the productivity growth that the entire U.S. group achieved over those eight years.As might be expected, tech giants including Amazon.com, Nvidia and Broadcom were prominent among the outperformers. In other industries, superstar retailers such as Home Depot have moved the ball forward, as have, perhaps more surprisingly, big air carriers such as United Airlines, McKinsey thinks.By the research team's thinking, each of these productivity superstars harnessed breakaway capabilities to transform the way its workers get things done. Home Depot's logistics, pricing and IT infrastructure, for example, have allowed its retail workers to produce far more value on the job than cashiers at mom-and-pop hardware stores ever could.That's not to say broader factors don't also play a part. The American culture of enterprise and the U.S.'s relatively permissive rules for businesses foster an environment that makes those innovations possible, said Olivia White, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, which produced the report.""It's very much going to be the fruit of both the regulatory environment in the country and also the ecosystem among the companies,"" White said. ""The way the whole system works really, really matters.""Data published Thursday by the Labor Department showed that productivity fell by 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, after rising by 1.7% in 2024's fourth quarter. It was the first quarterly decline in productivity in almost three years.Because explaining productivity is so subtle, many economists don't pay that much attention to changes from quarter to quarter. Over 2023 and 2024, U.S. productivity growth averaged about 2.6% per year, well above other big economies' track record.During those years, American productivity outperformance fueled a remarkable stretch of resilient growth coupled with falling inflation, a pairing that lifted the U.S. as a magnet for global investment. Yet there's been no deep consensus among economists on what set the U.S. apart.Competing explanations have included an intensive shortage of workers that hit during the postpandemic boom, which forced companies to deploy limited staff more productively. Others have argued that a large cohort of newly created businesses gave rise to thousands of new sandboxes where bosses could rethink how work gets done.McKinsey's research casts some doubt on those ideas. During the 2010s at least, McKinsey's new work suggests, U.S. productivity growth had a lot more to do with seismic changes that originated from a small posse of standouts.The firm also cites bold moves such as how Broadcom shifted its strategy to focus on infrastructure software, rather than just semiconductors, as turning points in the U.S. productivity story. Similarly, workers who played a part in Apple's smartphone business were helping to develop a genuinely life-changing and remarkably profitable product.Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010576:0-top-u-s-firms-may-set-the-course-for-productivity/

Nvidia Stock Leaps on Report Trump Will Relax AI Chip Export Curbs — Barrons.com,1746648660000,"Adam Clark and Liz MoyerNvidia stock jumped late in Wednesday's trading session after a report the Trump administration could relax export curbs on artificial intelligence chips.Shares of Nvidia closed up 3.1%. Other chip stocks also rallied after a Bloomberg report said President Donald Trump would overturn AI chip export curbs put into place by the Biden administration that were set to go into effect.Earnings from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer indicated healthy demand for artificial-intelligence chips, but they also highlighted risks from export restrictions and the transition to new infrastructure.Positive signs came from rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, which reported better-than-expected earnings, and gave sales guidance ahead of expectations in a report on Tuesday. Shares of AMD rose 1.8% on Wednesday.AMD warned that U.S. export controls on semiconductors would cost the company $1.5 billion in revenue this year, in a reminder of the threat hanging over the chip industry.Nvidia has already disclosed that its first-quarter results will include a $5.5 billion charge associated with inventory and purchase commitments related to the H20 chip for the Chinese market, following the imposition of licensing requirements. Analysts at Jefferies have suggested that will translate to around a $10 billion hit to revenue.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated the market in China for AI chips will be $50 billion in a few years, and warned that restriction on semiconductors exports wouldn't limit Chinese military capacity, in comments late on Tuesday to attendees of the Milken Institute annual meeting.Elsewhere, AI-server maker Super Micro reported earnings and revenue at the top end of its guided range on Tuesday, but provided disappointing guidance for the current quarter, noting some customers were delaying decisions. Super Micro sells servers that house Nvidia chips, and it said the issue partly related to the transition between Nvidia's older Hopper hardware and its new Blackwell processors.""We remain very confident with our midterm and long-term growth.

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

Marvell Stock Falls Sharply. What's Hurting the Former AI Chip Favorite. — Barrons.com,1746627960000,"By Adam ClarkMarvell Technology was falling sharply Wednesday after the company postponed its investor day in the face of market uncertainty.It's another blow for a stock which has lost its status as a favored play on the artificial-intelligence trend.The designer of data-storage and networking chips said it had decided to postpone its previously scheduled investor-day event from June 10 to an unspecified future date in 2026, citing ""the dynamic macroeconomic environment,"" in a statement late on Tuesday.At the same time, Marvell reaffirmed the midpoint of first-quarter revenue guidance and narrowed its range. It expects revenue of about $1.875 billion, with a range of plus or minus 2%.The stock was down 8.9% at $55.75 on Wednesday. That's set to add to a 45% drop this year so far through Tuesday's close, which has wiped out all of Marvell's gains from 2024.Marvell became a market darling last year alongside peer Broadcom as investors bet that its clients — which analysts believe include Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft — would spend heavily on the company's custom chip designs as they sought alternatives to Nvidia hardware.However, poorly received guidance alongside quarterly earnings in March sunk the stock as investors soured on AI plays amid tariff uncertainty. Marvell has also been hit by concerns that it might lose out on designing the next generation of Amazon's custom Trainium AI chips.""The postponed investor day will only add to the wall of worry that has developed around the name, particularly around Marvell's ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] opportunity following reports that Taiwanese competitor Alchip has won Amazon's next-generation Trainium 3 project,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji in a research note.Marvell did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.However Naji still sees opportunity in the shares, reiterating an Outperform rating on Marvell stock. He noted the company now trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 times his forecast for its 2025 earnings and 18 times its forecast 2026 earnings — a far cry from the forward earnings multiple of more than 40 times it carried late last year.""While at these levels the stock is not expensive, we worry that the shares may be range-bound until investor confidence in Marvell's custom chip pipeline improves,"" Naji wrote.Investors might hope for some reassurance at a June 17 webinar focused on the future of custom silicon technology for AI infrastructure, which Marvell said it would hold.""While we are encouraged that the company still plans to address its custom silicon opportunity, where the firm noted 'great progress,' we also read into the indefinite rescheduling of its investor day as a likely negative indicator for the firm's near-term upcoming July quarter outlook,"" wrote Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree in a research note.Acree lowered his estimates for Marvell's revenue for its fiscal 2026 year — ending Jan. 31 2026 — to $8.11 billion from $8.19 billion previously and his full-year earnings per share forecast to $2.74 from $2.80.The Benchmark analyst lowered his target price to $95 from $135. However, he kept a Buy rating on the stock and recommended investors take advantage of the weak share price.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

Broadcom Stock Gets a Lift on Hyperscaler Earnings & CapEx Boost,1746618300000,"Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ:AVGO continues to be a central player in the AI infrastructure build-out, and recent developments across the tech landscape may strengthen its growth outlook. Despite lingering market concerns about the pace and durability of AI-related spending, recent earnings season delivered a series of encouraging signals. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Several major technology firms reported strong momentum in their AI businesses, along with plans to maintain or increase capital expenditures tied to AI infrastructure.These announcements matter for Broadcom. As a supplier of high-performance networking components and custom silicon that help power large-scale AI deployments, Broadcom’s fortunes are tightly linked to the investment cycles of its largest customers.And while questions around competitive pressures and spending slowdowns have weighed on sentiment in recent months, investor response suggests a shift in tone: since the first of these earnings reports was released on April 24, Broadcom shares have climbed 7% through the May 6 close .The rebound reflects growing confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track—and that Broadcom remains well-positioned to benefit.AI Strength at Google & Meta Signal AI Strength for BroadcomTwo companies known as hyperscale customers of Broadcom are Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOGL , Google's parent company, and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META . Both companies posted strong results, largely due to the AI-centric parts of their business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud segment saw strong revenue growth of 28%. AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions were key drivers of this increase. The company also confirmed its CapEx spending forecast . It plans to allocate $75 billion , much of which will go to AI infrastructure through calendar 2025. The company also said that, like Q4 2024, Cloud demand exceeded capacity this quarter, another sign that CapEx spending isn’t tailing off.Meta also posted better-than-expected results . Its revenue grew at a solid 16% clip, and the price paid per ad increased by 10%. This indicates that the value of advertising on Meta’s apps continues to increase, likely driven by the AI investment the company is making. Meta also provided several examples showing that its AI investments are driving more engagement in its apps. Adding to the optimism around the AI story is the fact that the company actually increased its CapEx guidance for 2025 by 9%. The firm now expects to spend $68 billion at the midpoint.Both of these results are good signs for Broadcom . They show that these AI hyperscale customers are seeing their investment in the technology lead to tangible results. Amid concerns that AI spending could slow down due to the DeepSeek revelations, these companies are in no way signaling that this is actually the case. This is key for Broadcom , considering that big reductions in AI infrastructure spending would be very bad news for the stock. The fact that Broadcom shares sold off over 17% in just one day after the DeepSeek news broke evidences this. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:AVGO] Microsoft’s CapEx to Keep Growing: Could It Be Broadcom’s Next Customer?Microsoft’s NASDAQ:MSFT results also boost Broadcom's confidence , but in a somewhat different way. Microsoft reported a 33% increase in revenue from its Azure cloud business. AI is becoming a larger part of Azure’s growth. Three quarters ago, AI accounted for less than a quarter of the growth in Azure. That percentage has risen every quarter since. In the latest results,  almost half of Azure's growth came from AI . [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Additionally, Microsoft reaffirmed its CapEx spending through the fiscal year ending in June at $80 billion. For the company’s next fiscal year, it has yet to release exact CapEx forecasts . However, the figure will be more than $80 billion. On the earnings call, the company said that compared to fiscal 2025 levels, “ we expect CapEx to grow. ” However, it did mention that the growth rate in CapEx would slow.Microsoft isn't a confirmed customer of Broadcom's AI chips. Still, rising AI demand and growth CapEx support Broadcom's investment case . It shows that investments in AI, which are a huge driver of revenue growth for Broadcom , are paying off. This means that hyperscalers are likely to keep spending on AI, providing a robust source of revenue for Broadcom. Aside from its current hyperscale customers, Broadcom is also in talks to develop custom AI chips for four other hyperscalers. At some point, news could break that Microsoft is one of these firms.Amazon Adds to Optimism, Broadcom’s AI Demand Can Keep HummingFurther good news came from another hyperscaler, Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN . The company noted its AI business is growing at triple digits from the previous year and referenced that demand still exceeds capacity.The company didn’t change its CapEx guidance from $100 billion for calendar 2025. Amazon is not a Broadcom customer, but the reasons for optimism are similar to those related to Microsoft.The AI-related news coming from these hyperscalers provides strong reassurance about Broadcom's growth story . Seeing the AI train continue to chug along for some time is key to the success of Broadcom's stock. Looking forward, it appears the engine will continue to see more coal shoveled into its firebox.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:79fc3da9d094b:0-broadcom-stock-gets-a-lift-on-hyperscaler-earnings-capex-boost/

These 4 Top Investors Bought Over 6 Million Broadcom Shares in Q1,1747922400000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO is one of just 10 stocks globally with a market cap over $1 trillion as of May 21. This makes it one of the most closely watched stocks in the market. Retail investors and famous money managers have come to know this company well. It has played a key role in the AI infrastructure buildout, which has been driving the market higher for some time.Many big investors bought Broadcom in large amounts in Q1. This became clear when they released their 13F filings . That makes a good deal of sense, considering that Broadcom shares fell by more than 27% in Q1. The analysis below will detail some of the highest-profile investors who bought Broadcom in spades. It is important to note that the data on these purchases only extends to March 31. Thus, these investors could have sold or bought more Broadcom shares since. Still, knowing how investors felt about Broadcom and similar companies in Q1 can help retail investors understand how to view the stock going forward.AI Bubble Bear Grantham Owned Nearly 14x More AVGO Than NVIDIA in Q1A huge purchaser of Broadcom in Q1 was investor Jeremy Grantham. Grantham co-founded Grantham, May and Van Otterloo (GMO) and is the company’s long-term investment strategist. Grantham is often considered a contrarian investor, pushing back against overzealous market trends. Many consider him to have predicted the dot-com bubble around two years before it popped. Despite Grantham’s claims that AI investing is a bubble, Grantham’s GMO bought over 1.5 million shares of Broadcom in Q1. Additionally, many of the firm's biggest holdings are among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have invested tens of billions in AI infrastructure.Still, the big decline in Broadcom shares in Q1 could back up Grantham’s claims that the AI bubble would deflate. As of the May 21 close, Broadcom is trading only around 6% below its 2025 high. Assuming the stock stays near this level through the end of Q2, seeing GMO greatly reduce its Broadcom holdings in its Q2 13F would be a logical next step. This would indicate he actually sees Broadcom as part of the AI bubble and simply took advantage of it temporarily deflating in Q1. Interestingly, Grantham has just a $21 million position in NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , versus $291 million in Broadcom. Sure, NVIDIA only fell 19% in Q1, but this positioning indicates Grantham sees Broadcom as a relatively better value .Renaissance, Two Sigma, and Dalio Buy Over 5 Million Broadcom Shares CombinedAnother massive high-profile Broadcom buyer in Q1 was Renaissance Technologies , an investment firm many regard as the most successful hedge fund of all time. Renaissance purchased over 2.4 million shares of Broadcom in Q1, massively increasing the firm’s stake in the company. Renaissance is notoriously tight-lipped about its thoughts on the market, making it difficult to assert its thinking. However, depending on the data points looked at, one could argue that Renaissance may or may not still see value in Broadcom shares. [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Two Sigma Advisors and Bridgewater Associates are other notable investment companies that bought significant shares of Broadcom in Q1. They bought around 2.5 million and 280,000 shares, respectively. Two Sigma has become known as one of the pioneers of quantitative investing, relying largely on complex math and non-traditional data to invest. For many, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio needs no introduction. He is a prolific author, investing thought leader, and has built what was, at one time, the largest hedge fund in the world.At the end of Q1, Two Sigma held 3.9 million shares of Broadcom. The company hasn’t had even close to this big of a position since Q3 2024, when it held 3.6 million shares. Notably, Broadcom’s average closing price during that period was just $159. In Q1, that figure was $211. The company held more shares in Q1, when the average closing price was about 33% higher. This suggests it thinks Broadcom's intrinsic value has increased very significantly. However, whether it sees value in prices near $230 or higher is more questionable.Broadcom’s Big Gain in Q2 Could Reveal These Investors' True ThoughtsSince Broadcom’s shares now only trade marginally lower than their 2025 peak , these investors' next 13F filings could reveal at what price they are comfortable holding shares.If Broadcom remains near the $230 mark through the rest of Q2, continuing to hold their shares could indicate these investors see potential for the stock to test all-time highs near $250.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f0037420b094b:0-these-4-top-investors-bought-over-6-million-broadcom-shares-in-q1/
TSM Stock Soars 20% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1746558000000,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM has seen its share price soar 19.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 16.2% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit, or continue holding the stock?What Drove TSM Stock Higher?Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s recent rally stemmed from broader market optimism. Whispers of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations significantly boosted market sentiment in late April. Protracted trade tensions had previously dampened global economic forecasts and corporate earnings expectations due to tariffs and retaliatory measures.Hints of a potential deal suggested easing tensions, possible tariff reductions and smoother international trade flows. This improved outlook fostered investor confidence, leading to a rally in the equity market as fears of further economic disruption subsided and prospects for global growth seemed brighter.Semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Broadcom, Inc. AVGO, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, were the prime gainers from this rally as they had witnessed a tremendous selloff previously following the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. Over the past month, shares of Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA soared 30.5%, 21.2% and 16.3%, respectively.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI Boom Boosts TSM’s ProspectsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continues to dominate the semiconductor foundry space with its technological superiority and production scale. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has placed Taiwan Semiconductor at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle.The company has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players like NVIDIA, Marvell Technology and Broadcom.In 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, making up a mid-teen percentage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s total revenues, and the momentum is far from over. The company expects AI-related sales to double again in 2025, with an impressive 40% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. This positions TSM as the undisputed backbone of AI-driven technological advancements.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has started 2025 on a strong note by reporting overwhelming first-quarter results, wherein revenues surged 35% year over year to $25.53 billion, while net income jumped 53% to nearly $11 billion. This growth was driven by explosive demand for its 3nm and 5nm nodes, which together contributed nearly 58% of total wafer revenues.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s first-quarter EPS also jumped 53.6% to $2.12 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. The stock beat the consensus mark for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. QuoteTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is not only growing but also scaling at an unprecedented pace to capitalize on the AI-driven growing demand for advanced chips. The company is set to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, far outpacing its $29.8 billion investment in 2024. The bulk of this spending, around 70%, is focused on advanced manufacturing processes, ensuring TSM stays ahead of the curve.TSM Stock Trades at Attractive ValuationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.51, below the sector average of 23.84. This reasonable valuation, coupled with the company’s growth potential, offers an appealing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing also trades at a lower P/E ratio than other semiconductor players, including Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA trade at P/E ratios of 27.74, 20.95 and 24.8, respectively.Near-Term Risks Persist for TSMDespite its strengths, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing faces near-term headwinds. Higher energy prices in Taiwan, following a 25% electricity hike in 2024, pose a considerable challenge, especially as advanced nodes demand greater power.Softness in key markets like PCs and smartphones also dampens near-term prospects. These traditionally strong revenue drivers are projected to see only low single-digit growth in 2025, limiting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s growth despite rising AI demand.Additionally, rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are other concerns. These new facilities, while strategically important for diversification, are expected to dilute gross margins by 2-3% annually over the next three to five years due to higher labor and utility costs, coupled with lower initial utilization rates.Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, further cloud the outlook. With significant revenue exposure to China, export restrictions and supply-chain disruptions could pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s operations.Conclusion: Hold TSM Stock for NowTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s technological leadership and strategic investments make it a compelling long-term player in the semiconductor space. However, short-term challenges, including rising costs, tariff wars and geopolitical risks, warrant caution. For now, holding TSM stock remains the most prudent strategy, allowing investors to benefit from its industry leadership while navigating near-term uncertainties.Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Does Broadcom's Expanding Portfolio Make the AVGO Stock a Buy?,1747844580000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have surged 37.2% in the past month. The company is benefiting from an expanding portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business, strong balance sheet and impressive free cash flow. Broadcom has outperformed its closest semiconductor peers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Marvell Technology MRVL, shares of which have returned 35.6%, 32.6% and 21%, respectively, over the same time frame.AVGO Stock’s PerformanceBroadcom’s strategy of updating its portfolio on a frequent basis has been a key catalyst. The company is expanding its portfolio with the launch of its third-generation 200G per lane (200G/lane) Co-Packaged Optics product line. In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C) This follows March showcase of 200G/lane DSP and SerDes, 400G optics, and PCIe Gen6 over optics products at the 2025 Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC). Strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

This zero-day options craze could finally be coming to popular stocks like Nvidia and Tesla. Here's what to know.,1746543180000,"By Joseph AdinolfiNasdaq has asked the SEC for permission to list options tied to a handful of popular stocks that would expire on Mondays and WednesdaysAn earlier version of this story incorrectly named Scott Bauer's firm.A surge in trading of so-called ""zero days to expiry"" - or ""0DTE"" - options has contributed to an options-market boom over the past few years, drawing in both sophisticated investors and amateur speculators.During the trading week, investors have been limited to trading 0DTE contracts tied to stock-market indexes like the S&P 500 and a handful of popular ETFs, including the Invesco QQQ Trust.But after a long wait, they could soon be coming for popular stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)In a filing published late last week, Nasdaq Inc. officially asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to expand offerings of option contracts tied to a handful of individual stocks. If the SEC signs off, the exchange would be allowed to list options tied to a select group of stocks that expire on Mondays and Wednesdays, giving traders two more opportunities per week to trade option contracts on the edge of expiration.""It's probably been a long time in the making,"" Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy and a former floor trader on a major options exchange, told MarketWatch.Currently, options tied to individual common stocks only expire on Fridays, while contracts tied to some stock-market indexes and highly liquid ETFs have more frequent expirations.Although a Nasdaq executive declined to comment on the exchange's plans, traders and industry experts who spoke with MarketWatch said that, if all goes well, contracts expiring on Tuesdays and Thursdays could soon follow.""They're not pure 0DTEs in the sense that they're not listed every day, but it's getting pretty close,"" Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics, told MarketWatch.See: 2024 was another record-breaking year for options trading. What's on tap for the industry in 2025.What is a '0DTE' option?Any option due to expire at the end of a session is considered a 0DTE contract. Technically, every option becomes a 0DTE on the last day of its life.Traders who spoke with MarketWatch have said the appeal of these contracts lies in the small chance of an outsize gain. If the market pushes them into the money before they expire, it could lead to a large windfall for a trader who had bought them minutes or hours earlier.Back in 2022, popular exchange operators like Cboe Global Markets expanded offerings tied to the S&P 500 and a few popular ETFs to allow traders to trade 0DTE contracts every day of the trading week. The change helped accelerate a boom in options trading that had begun shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic.The average daily trading volume in these extremely short-dated contracts has been climbing steadily since. 0DTE volumes in S&P 500 index options hit a record during the first quarter of 2025, according to Cboe data.A Cboe analyst estimated that roughly 50% to 60% of the average daily activity in S&P 500 0DTE contracts involves amateur individual investors, although the exact share is difficult to determine precisely.Their rise has coincided with a surge in activity across the broader U.S. equity-options market. According to the Options Clearing Corporation, the industry's main clearinghouse, more than 12 billion contracts changed hands in 2024, setting a record for the fifth year in a row.It appears another record could follow in 2025, with the industry already on track to top 14 billion contracts traded, according to Henry Schwartz, vice president of market intelligence at Cboe.'We're working closely with everybody'The SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny Nasdaq's request once the filing is published in the Federal Register, which had not yet happened as of Tuesday morning. A representative for the SEC didn't return a request for comment from MarketWatch.Once approved, these options could start trading within days.Nasdaq's decision to request the change was the culmination of a lengthy process by exchanges, brokerage platforms, market makers and other options-industry players. The goal was to figure out the best way to introduce more short-dated contracts tied to shares of individual stocks in a manner that would minimize risks for the industry and its customers.Ultimately, the exchange decided that Monday and Wednesday contracts wouldn't be listed on any day when the underlying company is due to report quarterly earnings. This should help to limit the chances that volatile swings in stocks after the closing bell could complicate trade settlements, a Nasdaq representative said.""We're working closely with everybody to make sure we're doing this in a safe and responsible way,"" said Greg Ferrari, a senior vice president at Nasdaq within the market platforms division.The changes proposed by Nasdaq would only allow Monday and Wednesday expirations for a handful of stocks and one additional ETF. As of January 2025, only contracts tied to Nvidia, Tesla, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) would be eligible for the Monday and Wednesday listings, along with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF XLF.'Lottery tickets'Options-market activity has been trending toward shorter-dated contracts for years, said OptionMetrics' DeSimone.At the same time, the advent of free-to-trade electronic brokerages has helped inspire a new generation of amateur individual investors to try their hand at options trading.Making it easier to trade 0DTE tied to individual stocks could accelerate both of these trends, DeSimone said. While institutional players still dominate index options, individual traders are more active in the single-stock space, DeSimone said.DeSimone cautioned that anybody interested in trading these products should keep their risk profile in mind. Some in the industry have likened 0DTE contracts to ""lottery tickets"" that offer a small chance of a large payout, and a high likelihood that the contract will expire worthless.JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, parent of brokerage tastytrade, pushed back against this characterization, calling it hyperbolic. He said many investors trade 0DTE options as part of spread strategies involving more than one contract, allowing them to more precisely manage their risk. Nasdaq and others have said that 0DTEs can help large traders more tactically manage their risk.""I think people are excited for the opportunity, but again I think we'll need to do some more education regarding exercise and assignment risk,"" Kinahan said. ""We have to continue to educate as to what the risks of these are, especially after the close.""-Joseph AdinolfiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

CRDO vs. AVGO: Which AI-focused Semiconductor Stock is the Better Buy?,1747831440000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. CRDO and Broadcom Inc. AVGO are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions essential for AI-driven data centers.The data center market is undergoing rapid transformation as organizations accelerate their digital initiatives, including the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, along with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This surge in digital activity has resulted in explosive data growth, placing significant pressure on existing data center infrastructure. Consequently, there is a rising need for advanced data processing and storage solutions to support AI workloads. This trend presents strong growth opportunities for companies like Credo and Broadcom.So, now the question arises: Which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let’s dive into the pros and cons for each company.The Case for CRDOCredo is gaining a strong market presence in both Ethernet and Active Electrical Cables (AECs) solutions specialized for data centers. AEC products experienced triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by their increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.Credo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. CRDO’s PCIe and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo for significant future revenue growth.Momentum in the optical business, particularly Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. It recently unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Case for AVGOBroadcom is a diversified semiconductor company with a strong presence in AI chip development space. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. These hyperscalers are significantly ramping up investment in their next-generation frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators and AI data centers with larger clusters. AVGO noted that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Consequently, AVGO’s Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Apart from these three customers, AVGO is also working with four other hyperscalers to aid them in building their own customized AI accelerators.XPUs are necessary to train Generative AI (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. Its next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. AVGO is now planning to tape out the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.In the last reported quarter, semiconductor solutions revenues (55% of net revenues) totaled $8.2 billion, rising 11% year over year, driven by strong AI semiconductor revenues. AI-related revenues grew 77% year over year to $4.1 billion, which was a major driver of overall revenue growth. This growth was driven by higher shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers for AI applications.For second-quarter fiscal 2025, Broadcom expects revenues of $14.9 billion, while AI semiconductor revenues are projected to grow 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow 17% year over year to $8.4 billion.Price Performance and Valuation for CRDO & AVGOOver the past month, CRDO and AVGO have registered gains of 67.8% and 36.3%, respectively.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 15.50X, lower than AVGO’s 16.05X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO?Analysts have kept their earnings estimates unchanged for CRDO’s bottom line in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, for AVGO, there is a marginal upward estimate revision.CRDO or AVGO: Which is a Better Pick?Both CRDO and MRVL are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI driven data center market. CRDO at present flaunts a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Consequently, in terms of Zacks Rank, AVGO seems to be a better pick at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70a692c5f094b:0-crdo-vs-avgo-which-ai-focused-semiconductor-stock-is-the-better-buy/
Bull of the Day: Credo Technology (CRDO),1746523200000,"Credo Technology Group (CRDO) is a key supplier of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the hyperscale datacenter, 5G carrier, enterprise networking, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI/ML markets.Credo is located in the center of the AI revolution in San Jose, CA.With sales growing 120% this fiscal year to $425 million, one of Credo's high demand products is their line of Active Electrical Cables (AEC) which provide high-speed connectivity solutions to data centers and enterprises with heavy AI and cloud computing needs.Credo also makes Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chipsets to facilitate high-bandwidth data transfer with low energy usage.Credo's largest and most strategic customers are leading hyper-scalers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon who use Credo's AECs to support AI and cloud infrastructure.And its biggest competition comes from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) in connectivity solutions for the AI Economy.NVIDIA is the AI Market MakerAs I've said for almost eight years, Jensen & Co. have been creating new industries we didn't even know we needed. Once modern data enterprises and research universities caught on to what GPU-CUDA ""massively parallel architectures"" could do for them, they literally created new uses cases by the thousands per year.When you can simulate anything, use synthetic data to do so, and then run billions of iterations on your experimental idea in a matter of hours, innovation happens much faster.Thus Jensen talks about 1,000-fold advances in science, engineering, and social challenges. And then you understand why NVIDIA (NVDA) power tools are in such demand for the Global 2000 corporations, plus universities, plus nation-states who need to secure and ""mine & model"" their own data.In my NVIDIA (NVDA) ""Top Picks"" video on April 21, I compared the new Huawei supercomputer offering to NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72.And one of my points of focus was on the high-speed, low-latency connectivity required for these new rack-scale architectures. I didn't mention Credo, but I'm very curious about how closely they are working together since Jensen likes that ""copper is cheaper"" and perfectly still useful for direct connections between GPUs in racks.A Fly in the AnointmentThis all sounds great for Credo going forward, especially as they are projected to grow EPS this fiscal year by a whopping 600%!But the stock was richly valued before their Q3 FY2025 (ended April) report. Right now at an $8 billion market cap on forward sales of over $500 million, they are conservatively trading over 16X sales.By early March when they reported, CRDO shares had been cut in half from $80 to $40 in just a month just to get back down to earth at 16X sales. So it's safe to say they were trading near 30X sales in Q1 near the stock highs above $80.Part of the big pessimism -- or realism -- even before the trade war tumult, was that Credo's Q3 38% EPS beat and giant 12.5% revenue beat was built around a single large customer who may have contributed as much as 85% of that topline: Amazon.While they didn't disclose Amazon (AMZN) as the big kahuna in their operations, many analysts had sufficient reason to suspect this was the case.""As we shared last quarter, we had seven customers that contributed more than 5% of revenue,"" said Credo Chief Financial Officer Dan Fleming. ""And going forward, we expect that three to four customers will be greater than 10% of revenue in the coming quarters and fiscal year, as additional hyperscalers ramp to more significant volumes.""I think Credo can keep growing and we won't see another quarter so dependent on one large company.What Makes Credo's AECs More Efficient Than Other Cables?Credo's Active Electrical Cables (AECs) stand out for their efficiency and performance in modern data center environments, especially compared to traditional Direct Attached Copper (DAC) and Active Optical Cables (AOC). Here are the key factors:1. Substantial Power SavingsCredo’s AECs consume about 50% less power than traditional DACs and significantly less than AOCs, making them highly energy efficient.For example, their second-generation HiWire LP SPAN AECs reduce power consumption by nearly half while increasing cable reach by 40% compared to the previous generation.2. Thinner, More Flexible CablesCredo’s AECs use thinner copper (as slim as Cat 6 cables), reducing cabling volume by up to 75% compared to passive DACs. This makes them easier to route and manage in dense data center environments.The thinner, lighter cables also support longer distances and tighter bend radii, which is critical for modern rack-to-rack and server-to-switch connections.3. Superior Performance and ReliabilityIntegrated digital signal processors (DSPs) and retimers in Credo’s AECs deliver better signal integrity, enabling higher data rates (up to 800G and 1.6T) over longer distances without degradation.These cables offer extreme reliability, with Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) ratings up to 100 million hours, minimizing downtime and maintenance.4. Plug-and-Play SimplicityCredo’s AECs are hot-swappable and easy to deploy, providing a drop-in replacement for AOCs and DACs without the need for additional components or complex configuration.They also support advanced features like dual Top-of-Rack (TOR) redundancy for enhanced reliability in hyperscale data centers.5. Lower Environmental ImpactBy reducing power consumption and using less plastic and copper, Credo’s AECs help customers decrease their environmental footprint.Relentless Connectivity Innovation for AINow that you know Credo's key ""connector"" role in the AI economy, let me highlight recent press releases that you should go find on their website if you are interested in learning more...March 18: Credo and XConn to Showcase Seamless GPU Cluster at NVIDIA GTCMarch 26: Credo to Showcase AI Scale Out Fabric Featuring Credo Optical DSPs at OFC 2025March 27: Credo Named a Winner of the 2025 Top Workplaces USA AwardApril 1: Credo Unveils the Lark Family - Setting a New Benchmark for Low-Power 800G Optical DSPsIf their innovation cadence maintains like this, I'm sure their big customer wins will keep growing.

While the stock is off to a rough start for Q1, his description of their business was exceptional so I want to share it for your own due diligence...Credo aims to break bandwidth barriers in the data infrastructure market. It provides secure, high-speed connectivity solutions that deliver improved power efficiency as data rates and corresponding bandwidth requirements increase exponentially throughout the data infrastructure market.Specifically, Credo’s SerDes and DSP chips optimize data transfer by enabling high-speed, error-free communication within data centers, while its HiWire Active Electrical Cables (AECs) provide efficient, high-bandwidth connections between servers to support AI workloads and large-scale data processing.Many important trends are driving the data infrastructure market, such as cloud workloads, streaming video, 5G wireless deployment, the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), and, most notably, the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. These trends have all created an explosion of data that has stressed existing infrastructure and forced a major shift.(end of Sheraz Mian observations)The rapid adoption of AI and the need for efficient data center connectivity are driving increased demand for Credo’s products among top-tier builders of the AI Economy.Credo is expanding its customer base to include all the major technology firms -- from Apple to Tesla -- and multiple large enterprises in energy and education in the midst.Bottom line on CRDO: If Sheraz hadn't put Credo on my radar, I might not have studied it enough. Now that I know better, I think its a buy in the $40s.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d8dd6423c094b:0-bull-of-the-day-credo-technology-crdo/
"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.""We see Nvidia's leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,"" the analysts said.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia Stock Falls. Here's What's Weighing on the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1746454380000,"By Adam Clark and Tae KimNvidia stock was falling on Monday as investors assess Big Tech spending on its processors and balance that against potential restrictions on the chip maker's exports.Shares were down 0.7%, at $113.71, in early trading. The stock rose 2.6% on Friday.Nvidia stock rose more than 5% over the past five trading sessions and 17% in the past month, helped by technology companies Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.com all repeating their intention to invest heavily in artificial-intelligence infrastructure, which includes Nvidia's chips.However, Nvidia could be facing a 20% reduction in the long-term $500 billion total addressable market for its hardware from U.S. restrictions on its exports, according to BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya.""China is about half of this, based on China's direct contribution to global cloud capex. The other 10 [percentage] points is variable and will depend on how strictly the U.S. administration implements AI diffusion rules,"" Arya wrote in a research note.Arya kept a Buy rating and $150 target price on Nvidia stock.In April, Nvidia disclosed that future sales of its H20 AI accelerators to China would require a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is generally viewed as unlikely to be granted.Nvidia is now working on the design of its AI chips in order to make a processor that can be exported to China under U.S. restrictions as soon as June, technology-focused news outlet The Information reported over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment on the report.On Monday, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar also quantified the ""worst case"" scenario if Nvidia's top data center customers cut back on spending because of a difficult economic environment over the next year.Kumar estimates 6.5% of the chip maker's data-center revenue — worth about 40 cents of earnings per share — would be lost. Using a 25 times earnings multiple, the stock's downside price would be $76.25.On the flip side, Kumar figures the upside scenario would lead to a price of $177.45.Trading was mixed for two other chip makers.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Moody's, Broadcom, Microsoft and CoreWeave",1747743960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Moody's MCO, Broadcom AVGO, Microsoft MSFT and CoreWeave CRWV.U.S. Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech BoomsIn poker, a ""tell"" is a player's subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, ""If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?""Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market's resilient reaction to the Moody's downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Market Chatter: Intel Considers Divesting Networking, Edge Businesses",1747733728000,"Intel NASDAQ:INTC has contemplated selling its network and edge businesses, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter. The chipmaker is considering a potential sale because the businesses in its former NEX group no longer seem relevant to the focus that Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan has adopted for the company, two sources told the news agency. The unit will no longer help Intel's core strategy, Reuters reported, citing a source. The company may sell its networking business because Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and other firms have a tight grip on key parts of that market, according to the report. Intel has not yet launched a formal deal process for the unit, or solicited bidders, Reuters reported, citing two sources. The company recently interviewed investment bankers to pick an adviser for the sales process, though it has not yet hired a banker, according to the report. Intel didn't immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250520:A3381640:0/

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar)Astera Labs, Inc. Stock Price and EPS SurpriseAstera Labs, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Astera Labs, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Have Influenced Q1 PerformanceAstera Labs’ first-quarter 2025 revenues are likely to have benefited from increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers and data center infrastructure. Strong momentum across its three key product families, Aries, Taurus, and Leo, is likely to have contributed well. The Aries peripheral component interface express (PCIe) retimers and Taurus Ethernet product lines are expected to have driven significant revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. With continued adoption across AI platforms and general-purpose compute systems, these products are likely to have sustained high demand in the first quarter. Revenues from Taurus 400 gig Ethernet solutions are expected to have contributed significantly to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by both AI and general-purpose compute infrastructure applications.The expansion of the Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch family, which is already generating preproduction shipments, is expected to have contributed positively in the first quarter.ALAB Stock Underperforms Sector and IndustryALAB shares have plunged 45.1% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decrease of 8.9% and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 15.2%. The underperformance can be attributed to concerns over the lower-than-expected gross margin driven by a shift in product mix toward hardware-based solutions. Along with this, a broader market weakness in the tech sector and persistent fear over mounting tariffs by the current government have added to the pressure.YTD ALAB Stock PerformanceALAB Stock is Currently OvervaluedALAB stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 15.36X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 5.71X.Price/Sales Ratio (Forward 12 Months)ALAB Benefits From Expanding PortfolioALAB’s expanding portfolio is expected to have been a key catalyst. The company recently announced the ramp-up of production for its purpose-built PCIe6 connectivity portfolio, which includes gearbox solutions, fabric switches, retimers, and active cable modules. It aims to enhance the performance, scalability, and efficiency of AI and cloud infrastructure systems while supporting longer-distance connectivity with optical media for advanced AI platforms. Benefits from this announcement are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.ALAB’s expanding portfolio is expected to have helped it fend off competition from other industry players like Broadcom AVGO, which is also making strong efforts in the PCIe Retimer market.In February 2025, Broadcom announced the availability of its end-to-end PCIe Gen6 portfolio, advancing AI infrastructure solutions through successful interoperability testing with Micron and Teledyne LeCroy.Additionally, Broadcom’s introduction of scalable, high-performance, and low-power 400G PCIe Gen 5.0 Ethernet adapters aims to transform data centers by resolving connectivity bottlenecks.ALAB Powers AI Advancements With Top ChipmakersAstera Labs has made a significant impact on the AI industry with collaborations with top chipmakers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology, and Intel. This is likely to have driven growth during the first quarter.ALAB recently introduced its Scorpio Smart Fabric Switches for PCIe 6-ready NVIDIA Blackwell-based MGX platforms, delivering high-performance, modular scalability for AI and cloud infrastructure.With comprehensive design-in collateral and interoperability validation in its Cloud-Scale Interop Lab, ALAB enhances NVIDIA MGX platform integration by optimizing GPU utilization, improving energy efficiency, and enabling advanced rack-level management through its COSMOS software.Advanced Micro Devices also continues to utilize Astera Labs solutions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of its AI-driven products. The partnership between Advanced Micro Devices and Astera Labs strengthens both companies’ positions in the AI market, fueling advancements in next-gen technologies.Conclusion: Hold ALAB Stock for NowDespite a strong product portfolio, ALAB faces increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets, particularly from larger semiconductor companies that are ramping up their product offerings for AI infrastructure. This competition is expected to hurt the company’s financial performance. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainties and stretched valuations are concerns.Astera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

"US Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech Booms",1747682700000,"US Stocks Brush Aside Moody’s DowngradeIn poker, a “tell” is a player’s subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody’s ( MCO ) credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, “If bad news can’t bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?”Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics Present BeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.Image Source: BeSpoke Investment Group The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom ( AVGO ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there’s anything baseball’s steroid era taught, it’s that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China. Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950 S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Image Source: Carson Investment ResearchBottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market’s resilient reaction to the Moody’s downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:bf8993135094b:0-us-stocks-brush-off-moody-s-echo-past-tech-booms/

The stock rose 2.5% in Thursday's session.Amazon gave a reassuring look at trends of spending on artificial-intelligence infrastructure as its first-quarter capital expenditure came to $24.3 billion, up from $13.9 billion in the same period the previous year, in its earnings report on Thursday. That leaves it broadly on track for its planned $100 billion spending this year.""[The capex] primarily relates to AWS [Amazon Web Services] as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and International segments,"" executives said in a call with analysts.Despite the reference to in-house chips, the continued pace of spending is likely good news for Nvidia after Microsoft and Meta Platforms also both said this week they would continue investing heavily in AI data centers. An Amazon executive pushed back against reports last month that it was pulling back on AI infrastructure.""We could be helping more customers and driving more revenue for the business if we had more capacity. We have a lot more Trainium2 instances and the next generation of Nvidia's instances landing in the coming months,"" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told analysts.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was up 2.3% and Broadcom gained 2% in morning trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

SentinelOne Rises 25% in a Month: Should You Still Buy the Stock?,1747674840000,"SentinelOne ’s S shares have surged 25% in a month, outperforming the Zacks Security industry’s return of 19.4% and the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s appreciation of 22.8%. The recent outperformance can be attributed to the company’s strong AI-powered portfolio, rich partner base and expanding clientele despite stiff competition.In the cybersecurity space, SentinelOne is facing stiff competition from the likes of Okta OKTA, Broadcom AVGO and Microsoft MSFT. While Okta’s main focus is on identity management, Broadcom’s Symantec is a traditional legacy antivirus suite. Microsoft’s Defender suite is broadly integrated with its own operating system, lacking openness with third-party platforms.Meanwhile, SentinelOne’s Singularity platform is a complete AI-native and provides security at multiple levels, including endpoint, cloud, identity and data through a single interface. The Purple AI provides investigation, real-time threat detection and automated response through its generative AI-powered security analysis, substantially reducing the response time of enterprises. SentinelOne’s modular and multi-cloud compatible architecture gives it a first mover advantage compared to its peers as it offers a more modern and AI-driven solution to enterprises, leading the way into the future.However, SentinelOne stock has underperformed its competitors over the past month. Okta, Broadcom and Microsoft shares have appreciated 37.7%, 37.5% and 26.5%, respectively, over the same time.SentinelOne, Inc. Price and Consensus SentinelOne, Inc. price-consensus-chart | SentinelOne, Inc. QuoteSentinelOne Benefits From Product Innovation and Rich Partner BaseSentinelOne is expanding its reach in the market with an impressive partner base, which includes some of the top names in the industry, like Alphabet, Lenovo and Amazon Web Services (AWS), among others.S has integrated its services with platform solution providers like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Okta and Microsoft to provide seamless security workflows to its end users. The Purple AI platform helps secure Gen AI applications on the Amazon bedrock, whereas the Singularity Cloud workload helps secure AWS containerized workloads.In fourth-quarter 2025, 12+ new large Managed Security Service Providers adopted SentinelOne’s AI SIEM, CNAPP and Purple AI modules, enhancing recurring revenues. By the end of the previous quarter, the company had more than 14000 direct customers and saw a 25% increase in customers with ARR exceeding $100,000. The total number of such customers stood at 1411 by the end of January 2025.In April 2025, SentinelOne partnered with Nord Security to provide SMBs with an integrated endpoint and network security solution, increasing the revenue potential for both companies.In May 2025, SetinelOne received FedRAMP High Authorization for its Purple AI, Singularity Cloud Security CNAPP and Singularity Hyperautomation solutions. This authorisation provides the company with the opportunity to sell its services to federal agencies, public sector and critical infrastructure organisations, driving top-line growth.SentinelOne Offers Strong Q1 and FY2026 GuidanceSentinelOne has provided positive guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2026.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenues to be around $228 million, indicating 22% growth year over year.

Buy 5 Big AI Laggards of Q1 That Found Wings and Soared Past Month,1747659600000,"U.S. stock markets closed first-quarter 2025 on a negative note after two years of an impressive bull run. The technology sector, particularly artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, suffered the most following the Fed’s ambiguity about further lowering interest rates anytime soon and the fear of a near-term recession. In the first half of second-quarter 2025, Wall Street remained more volatile due to the Trump administration’s tariffs and trade policies, as well as their impact on the U.S. economy, particularly on an already elevated inflation rate.Despite this headwind, several AI stocks that lagged in the first quarter have flourished in the past month. Here, we recommend five such AI stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful in the near term. These stocks are: AppLovin Corp. APP, Amphenol Corp. APH, Arista Networks Inc. ANET, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Twilio Inc. TWLO. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings growth potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.AppLovin Corp.Zacks Rank #1 AppLovin is engaged in building a software-based platform for mobile app developers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their apps in the United States and internationally. APP provides a technology platform that enables developers to market, monetize, analyze and publish their apps. AppLovin’s last reported financial results demonstrate its strong fundamentals and growth potential. The introduction of APP’s AI-powered AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion in gaming studios have significantly boosted revenue growth. APP’s Ai-enabled Audience+ marketing platform is also boosting its reach into direct-to-consumer and e-commerce space. AppLovin has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 24.3% and 85.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 25.6% in the last 30 days. Amphenol Corp. Zacks Rank #1 Amphenol provides connectivity solutions using AI and ML (machine learning) technologies. It provides AI-powered high-density, high-speed connectors and cables, and interconnect systems optimized for signal integrity and thermal performance. Amphenol benefits from a diversified business model. APH’s strong portfolio of solutions, including high-technology interconnect products, is a key catalyst. Expansion of spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies bodes well for APH’s top-line growth. Apart from Defense, APH’s prospects ride on strong demand for its solutions across Commercial Air, Industrial and Mobile devices. The Andrew acquisition is expected to add roughly $0.09 to earnings in 2025. APH’s diversified business model lowers the volatility of individual end markets and geographies. Its strong cash-flow-generating ability is noteworthy.Amphenol has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 32.3% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% in the last seven days. Arista Networks Inc.Zacks Rank #2 Arista Networks is well-positioned with the right network architecture for client-to-campus data center cloud and AI networking backed by three guiding principles. These include the best-in-class, highly proactive products with resilience, zero-touch automation and telemetry with predictive client-to-cloud one-click operations with granular visibility and prescriptive insights for deeper AI algorithms.ANET’s EOS Smart AI Suite and Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) enhance AI job monitoring, deep-dive analytics, and proactive performance issue resolution. Its AI suite also focuses on network security and optimization.ANET’s AI-powered cloud networking solutions provide predictable performance and programmability, enabling seamless integration with third-party applications for network management, automation and orchestration. Arista AVA offers augmentation of pervasive visibility, continuous threat detection, and enforcement. The growing demand for 200- and 400-gig high-performance switching products augurs well for ANET’s long-term growth. Arista Networks has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.7% and 12.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4% in the last 30 days. Broadcom Inc.Broadcom has been benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Strong demand for AVGO’s application-specific integrated chips, designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of fiscal first quarter, roughly 70% of Broadcom’s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation. AVGO’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential.AVGO’s XPUs are necessary for training generative AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. AVGO’s next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom remains on track for volume shipment of these XPUs to its hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as specific hyperscalers have started to develop their own XPUs. Broadcom believes that by 2027 each of its three hyperscalers would deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone.Broadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21% and 35.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% in the last 60 days.Twilio Inc.Zacks Rank #2 Twilio is a leading provider of cloud communications Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS) in the United States and internationally. TWLO is focusing on generative AI offerings to tap the growing opportunities in this space. In this regard, TWLO launched Customer AI technology in June 2023, which powerfully combines customer engagement platform data, generative and predictive AI, and large language models (LLMs) to unlock stronger customer relationships for brands. TWLO is integrating generative AI capabilities across its platform and every customer touch point.

Broadcom and JinkoSolar have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1746188580000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 2, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Broadcom AVGO as the Bull of the Day and JinkoSolar JKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford F, Tesla TSLA and General Motors GM .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Broadcom manufactures and sells semiconductors that are used in a range of technology products, such as smartphones, AI data centers, and the automotive industry, to name a few. Semiconductor solutions accounted for roughly 60% of 2024 revenues.AI-Related CapEX Remains StrongWhile the names of companies may come and go, and each moment in history on Wall Street is unique, every bull cycle has an underlying theme. That is, one growth industry that drives so much growth that it can lead the market up and down. For instance, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the key industry was railroads. The innovation was so novel and game-changing that it produced the most growth, profits, and speculation. The late 1990s saw the internet craze lead the US stock market higher and ultimately lower.Today, that industry is artificial intelligence. Grand View Research predicts that the global AI market will balloon to more than $1.8 trillion over the next five years, racking up a compound annual growth rate of ~35%. CapEx, or Capital Expenditure spending mostly from America’s cash-rich big tech companies, is the key to determining AI growth and, thus, Broadcom’s potential earnings growth. As earnings season hits its stride, Broadcom and other big tech companies are receiving welcome news on the CAPEX front.Semiconductor RestrictionsRestrictions on sending semiconductors overseas are an equally big threat to the semiconductor business. Yesterday, the Trump White House eased some of those concerns when it said it is considering easing restrictions after Nvidiaand other semiconductor juggernauts pushed for rule changes.AVGO: Expect Big Earnings GrowthBroadcom benefits from robust demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Last year, AI revenues bolted 220% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that AVGO will grow 42.73% this quarter, and 35.52% for full-year 2025.Broadcom Announces Massive Buyback ProgramDuring last quarter’s earnings conference call, AVGO management announced a massive $10 billion buyback. Share buybacks are bullish because they reduce the supply of stock available in the market, often leading to higher share prices.AVGO is a Perennial EPS WinnerAVGO has not missed Wall Street estimates in at least 5 years.Bottom LineFueled by explosive AI growth, strong CapEx spending from tech giants, and a gigantic share buyback program, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution.Bear of the Day:Zacks Rank #5 stock JinkoSolar is a Chinese manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules and energy systems. JinkoSolar builds a vertically integrated solar product through its supply chain, which is recovered from silicon materials or solar modules. The company’s primary products are silicon wafers, solar cells, and solar modules, which are all PV. JKS has residential, commercial, and utility scale projects globally and is focused on sustainability and clean energy innovation.Tariff Wars Lead to Uncertainty for Chinese Solar IndustryWith the intensifying trade war between the United States and China, uncertainty abounds on Wall Street. The Trump administration’s attempt to negotiate bilateral trade deals globally has sparked heated rhetoric, tit-for-tat threats and tariffs, and uncertainty on Wall Street. Though it appears that the Trump team has made progress with some countries, China and the United States remain miles apart.For instance, over the past few days, the Trump team has claimed that talks are being held between the two adversaries, while the Chinese government has denied such claims. Meanwhile, Trump officials such as Treasury Scott Bessent say that a deal with China could take as long as two or three years.For years, President Trump has alleged that China is “dumping cheap product” on the United States and other countries. It’s not just right-leaning politicians saying this, either. In 2024, then-Treasury Secretary Jant Yellen warned that China is treating the global economy as a dumping ground for cheap, clean energy products. In other words, the Chinese government subsidizes clean energy companies so that their prices are artificially low, putting local companies out of business.When those companies exit the market, the Chinese companies hike prices. In response to this threat, Trump has set solar tariffs as high as 3,521% in Asia! While this is likely a positive for US solar companies like First Solarand Tesla , it essentially means that the US market is non-existent to companies like JinkoSolar.JKS Earnings Are Likely to SlideWall Street analysts are incredibly bearish on Jinko’s future and expect EPS to crater 453.85% this year!JKS Is a LaggardJKS shares exhibit relative price weakness and are down 28.2% year-to-date, dramatically underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Meanwhile, shares are stuck below the key moving averages and are carving out a bear flag structure.Bottom LineJinkoSolar, a major Chinese manufacturer of solar PV products, faces several bearish headwinds due to trade tensions between the US and China.Additional content:Buy, Sell or Hold Ford Stock Ahead of Q1 Earnings?Ford is slated to release first-quarter 2025 results on May 5, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s EPS and automotive revenues is pegged at breakeven and $35.5 billion, respectively.The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has moved up by 2 cents over the past seven days. In the year-ago period, the company reported EPS of 49 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests an 11% decline from the year-ago quarter’s figure.For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for F’s automotive revenues is pegged at $162.3 billion, suggesting a decline of 6% year over year. The consensus mark for full-year EPS is $1.22, calling for a 33.7% year-over-year contraction.In the trailing four quarters, this U.S. legacy automaker surpassed EPS estimates on two occasions, missed once and matched on the other, with the average earnings surprise being 1.21%.Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company QuoteQ1 Earnings Whispers for FOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ford this time around.

The company’s sales declined 1.3% in the to-be-reported quarter to 501,291 units. The drop was mainly due to the timing of rental fleet sales and the discontinuation of the Ford Edge and Transit Connect. However, retail sales grew 5% during the quarter. Sales of Ford’s electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, jumped 25.5% to 73,623 units.Tesla was another auto biggie that saw its deliveries drop in the quarter under discussion. It delivered 336,681 EVs, which fell 13% year over year. Meanwhile, Ford’s closest peer General Motors sold 693,363 units in the first quarter of 2025, up 17% year over year.Ford had notified on its last earnings call itself that the company will sell fewer internal combustion engine vehicles compared to 2024. Additionally, a shift in product mix and foreign exchange headwinds will drag profits.Ford had guided breakeven adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2025, marking a sharp drop from $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to lower volumes, a 20% production cut and plant launch activities.Here’s a rundown of the estimates for Ford’s revenues and EBIT for key segments for the three months ended March 31.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford Blue unit (comprising ICE and hybrid models) is pegged at $17.6 billion, implying a decrease of 19% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBIT is $275 million, down from $905 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford model e unit (comprising of electric vehicles) is pegged at $1.5 billion, compared with $115 million in the corresponding period in 2024. The consensus mark for the segment’s loss before interest and taxes is $1.17 billion, narrower than $1.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford Pro unit (encompassing commercial vehicles and services) is pegged at $16.2 billion, implying a decline of 10% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBIT is $1.5 billion, suggesting a decline from $3 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2024.F’s Price Performance & ValuationYear to date, shares of Ford have inched up 1.1%, outperforming the industry. It has also performed better than Tesla and General Motors, whose shares have plunged 30% and 15%, respectively, so far in 2025.From a valuation perspective, Ford is trading relatively cheap. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.24, below the industry’s 2.37. The company has a Value Score of A. Meanwhile, Tesla looks too pricey at a forward sales multiple of 8.57, whereas General Motors’ P/S sits at 0.25.How to Play Ford Pre-Q1 EarningsFord is indeed facing challenges. Widening EV losses, weakening ICE performance and auto tariffs threaten margins and earnings. Its 2025 outlook is soft and doesn’t even account for tariffs. Full-year adjusted EBIT is forecast at $7-$8.5 billion, down from $10.2 billion in 2024. Warranty costs and generous incentives will weigh on margins and overall profitability. However, not all is gloom and doom.The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future for the Ford Pro segment. While the 2025 EBIT guidance for the segment implies a year-over-year decline, it is still expected to be the major profit driver for the company. Additionally, Ford’s high dividend yield of roughly 6% is quite appealing to income-focused investors. The company targets a payout ratio of 40-50% of free cash flow, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns. Ford’s strong liquidity position provides a cushion, with $28 billion in cash and around $47 billion in total liquidity at the end of 2024.So, all in all, it is worth holding on to Ford stock now. However, investing ahead of its upcoming results doesn’t seem a good idea. It’s better to wait for management’s commentary on tariffs and updated 2025 guidance to see the potential impact.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"

Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals — Barrons.com,1747634400000,"By Tae KimAmid the gold rush to build data centers and AI models, Nvidia has sold the most sought-after tools, driving triple-digit annual sales growth and turning the company into a $3 trillion market value giant.For the most part, Nvidia sells a ""full-stack AI solution"" that includes computer processors, or CPUs, networking equipment, and the AI accelerator, also known as the GPU. It's inside an Nvidia-designed server rack. Together, these components helped to train and serve new AI models.But now Nvidia is taking a significant step toward opening its platform, allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chip. It offers the option for future Nvidia racks with, say, Nvidia and Qualcomm chips inside.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the move on Monday at the COMPUTEX trade show in Taiwan. The new system is called NVLink Fusion.""A tectonic shift is under way: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected — AI is being fused into every computing platform,"" Huang said. ""NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures.""Nvidia's current top-of-the-line GB200 NVL72 AI server rack system includes Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.Initial NVLink Fusion AI chip partners include MediaTek, Marvell, and AIchip. Fujitsu and Qualcomm are the initial CPU partners.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack scale architecture, we're advancing our vision of high-performance, energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Qualcomm Technologies CEO Cristiano Amon said in a press release.The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's ecosystem when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology.For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its server platform and to drive more revenue.There's one catch: Broadcom, which makes many of the custom AI chips for large tech companies, wasn't on Nvidia's initial partner list, though the company said more partners could be added in the future.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Apple, Amazon shares slip after hours; tech shares jump earlier",1746123921000,"Shares of both Apple and Amazon.com eased in after-hours trading on Thursday, with forecasts including Apple's estimated tariff costs disappointing investors after U.S. tech-related shares jumped earlier in the day.Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL stock was down 4% after the bell. While the company's results were better than analysts had expected, CEO Tim Cook said estimated tariffs will add about $900 million in costs to the quarter ending in June if rates do not change.Cook also outlined changes to the company's supply chain to minimize the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war.Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN shares were down 2.5% after it reported first-quarter cloud revenue growth and forecast operating income below estimates.During the regular session, U.S. technology-related stocks including many involved in artificial intelligence rose sharply following stronger-than-expected results from Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META late in the previous session. The Nasdaq TVC:IXIC gained 1.5% on the day.Their results helped allay fears the massive spending on AI in recent years would not be rewarded.Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said Apple ""has storm clouds on multiple fronts,"" and cited tariffs on its call. But he said he's still upbeat on megacap tech-related names overall, noting the strong results from other names in the group.Microsoft shares ended 7.6% higher on Thursday after it said late Wednesday that AI's contribution to Azure growth increased to 16 percentage points in its fiscal third quarter, from 13 percentage points in the previous three months. Shares of Meta Platforms ended 4.2% higher.

Growth Stocks Are the Place to Be After Microsoft and Meta Earnings — Barrons.com,1746121260000,"By Jacob SonenshineMicrosoft and Meta Platforms' robust earnings proved growth stocks are the place for smart investors to keep their money.Investors should own growth stocks beyond these two tech heavyweights, such as companies that supply the data centers critical for their operations, as well as software companies that are benefiting from a similar trend that Microsoft is enjoying.That's because the overall growth picture at Microsoft and Meta looks strong, and signals more spending on data-center products and software ahead. Both companies reported better-than-expected sales and earnings and offered solid guidance.Microsoft projects that its fastest-growing cloud product, Azure, will see second-quarter revenue growth to close to 35% year over year. The product includes artificial intelligence, which makes customers more efficient and is therefore priced higher than many of its other products. That's driving the company's guidance for total sales growth of about 14% in the current quarter.While analysts had begun to worry that software customers would scale back their technology budgets amid tariffs and an uncertain economic outlook, Microsoft's report proves companies have enough confidence to invest.Ultimately, software companies are growing faster — despite the economic backdrop — because their customers are shifting away from traditional ways of storing and analyzing data and toward the new, AI-enhanced offerings. Stock in Salesforce was up 1%, while Oracle shares rose 5%, and ServiceNow rose 1.5%.These stocks have room to rise more, as analysts expect these companies post continued earnings growth. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector Exchange-Traded Fund trades at just over 33 times expected earnings, in aggregate, for the coming 12 months, below its peak of 40 times in the past two years. Analysts are likely to revise Microsoft's — and potentially other software companies' — earnings forecasts higher.Meanwhile, Meta's guidance called for second-quarter sales of $44 billion, implying 13% year-over-year growth. Brands are continuing to increase their advertising spend on Instagram and Facebook, as the company reported strong user engagement, growth in ad impressions, and higher ad prices.That's why other internet and advertising-related names were up Thursday. Alphabet's stock gained 0.9%. The platforms that dominate people's time and attention are winning, as internet companies' AI investments are enabling them to show each user the right content and ads, moving more ad spending onto their platforms. Clearly, brands aren't pulling back on marketing budgets enough to derail this trend.Elsewhere, Pinterest was gaining over 3%, and Trade Desk up 1.5%.The other major positive from the earnings reports was capital investment. Meta said it would grow capital expenditures this year by just over 80% to about $64 billion at the midpoint of the range. That comes just after Alphabet said it, too, will grow capex by double-digits, in percent terms, to $75 billion. Microsoft wants to slow the rate of growth of its capital investments, but analysts still expect growth overall. These companies are building data centers to support their AI capabilities.This is key for all the companies that make products that build data centers. Shares Nvidia, which sees the majority of its sales come from datacenter customers, rose 4% Wednesday. Chip maker Broadcom, which also sells into datacenters, climbed just over 3%. Micron Technology, which is still ramping up its datacenter memory business, edged up just over 2%.Arista Networks, which sells switches to Microsoft and Meta, jumped more than 6%.Vertiv Holdings, which see the majority of its cooling and power equipment sales from datacenters, spiked almost 9%. Peer Eaton, which sees a little less of its revenue from datacenters, gained around 3%.As long as the datacenter and AI trend keeps growing, this laundry list of companies will continue to see earnings growth and stock gains.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

QCOM Unveils Advanced Snapdragon 7 Chipset: Should You Buy the Stock?,1747419780000,"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QCOM recently introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. One of the significant improvements in the new platform is a 65% improvement in AI performance. This will ensure seamless support for various large language models, generative AI assistants and stable diffusion image generation on smartphones. A 30% faster GPU rendering will facilitate improved framerates and smoother gameplay. To improve the gaming experience, the company has included Snapdragon Elite Gaming features into the platform. 27% improvement in CPU performance will ensure seamless multitasking and enhanced system responsiveness.Qualcomm has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs such as HONOR and vivo have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.The solution brings several multimedia capabilities. New camera capabilities include video super resolution, hardware electronic image stabilization and advanced image processing features. The 3GPP release 17 for 5G, along with support for WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0, ensures seamless connectivity. Moreover, support for Snapdragon Sound technology, including Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network technology, ensures premium wireless audio quality.Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series is used primarily in mid-range smartphones. Availability of advanced camera capabilities, action-packed gaming and advanced on-device AI in the Snapdragon 7 series chip set will be a game changer for mid-range smartphone users.QCOM Rides on Portfolio Strength, Innovation and AI FocusThe company has ramped up its efforts to solidify its position in the rapidly growing AI domain. QCOM took the market by storm with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs, Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions. Qualcomm is also witnessing solid market traction in the automotive business. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, automotive revenues rose 59% to $959 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform.These developments suggest Qualcomm is moving beyond the smartphone industry by diversifying its portfolio and venturing into new high-growth verticals such as AI PC, AI data centers, automotive and edge AI industrial IoT technologies and solutions. Its strategy of continuous innovation and portfolio diversification will likely boost commercial prospects.Major Challenges for QCOMSamsung and Apple, Inc. AAPL, which have been major buyers of Qualcomm chips for several years, are now moving toward in-house chip development. Samsung has launched several mobile chips under its Exynos lineup, which are used in both the mid-range and premium smartphone segments. Apple has also introduced several chips for its smartphone and PC products. The company uses the A18 Pro chip for the iPhone 16 Pro series and the A18 for iPhone 16 models. Moreover, in the iPhone 16e model, Apple has replaced the Qualcomm modem previously used in iPhone 15 models with an in-house C1 modem. Such initiatives from long-standing customers are a major concern for Qualcomm.The company is also facing intense competition from MediaTek in the mid-range smartphone segment. In the network space, the company faces competition from Broadcom Inc. AVGO. Despite some major issues, Intel Corporation INTC continues to be the dominant player in the PC market. With innovative launches such as Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors, the company is gaining strong momentum in the AI PC domain. Despite enhanced power efficiency and connectivity of Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, Qualcomm has to match the seamless compatibility that Intel processors offer with existing software to gain a competitive edge. This is a complex endeavor.Qualcomm has an extensive presence in China. Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can significantly impact its operations. However, following negotiations, both the United States and China have decided to temporarily reduce tariffs. If they fail to reach a resolution within this period, tariffs may rise again. This will negatively impact QCOM’s operating margin.Price PerformanceQCOM shares have declined 21% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 20.7%. The company has outperformed Intel but underperformed relative to Broadcom. Intel has declined 32.7%, while Broadcom has surged 64.7%.Estimate Revision Trend of QCOMEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 0.34% to $11.8 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has decreased 1.85% to $12.21. This portrays mixed sentiments about the stock’s growth potential from investors.End NoteQualcomm intends to be the driving force in the next wave of AI innovations. The company’s effort to broaden its market reach beyond the mobile chipset market is an important step toward that direction. The future of AI innovation is not concentrated in a particular sector, but it is dispersed across a vast ecosystem. Hence, Qualcomm’s multi-dimensional approach is creating new revenue-generating opportunities in automotive, industrial IoT, data center, and edge AI domains while also strengthening its leadership position in the mobile chipset industry.However, aggressive competition in the smartphone chipset market and several of QCOM’s client strategy of in-house chip development are likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future.

Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Broadcom: Buy, Hold, Sell? AI & Acquistions Paint Strong Picture",1746107280000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] For shareholders in the world’s second-largest  semiconductor company , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , the last several years have borne incredible fruit. Over the past five years, Broadcom stock has provided a total return of approximately 690% as of the Apr. 30 close. The demand for the company’s AI data center infrastructure offerings may be second only to NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA .Its acquisition of VMware has given it an extremely powerful position in the virtualization market, and Broadcom has made VMware vastly more valuable.However, the huge run-up in the company’s share price begs the question: Can Broadcom sustain gains long-term? The company is trading for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 28x. This is around 38% higher than the forward P/E of the S&P 500 Index, which sits just above 20x.This suggests that the market may be overvaluing Broadcom. But is that really the case, and is Broadcom a buy, hold, or sell right now?This analysis will answer this question by breaking down Broadcom’s two main businesses: semiconductors and software.Broadcom’s Semiconductor Business: Sustaining Strong Growth Is Far From Out of the QuestionBroadcom stock has made most of its hay due to the rabid demand for AI-chips. Sales in this space have been growing at an incredibly fast pace. In 2024, AI-chips and networking solutions grew by 220% . In Q1 2025, the growth rate was 77%. Next quarter, the company sees 44% growth in AI for total AI revenue of $8.5 billion through the first half of 2025.So, growth rates are coming down, but what is the company forecasting?The company believes three hyperscalers will generate a serviceable addressable market (SAM) in AI of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. However, this is not the revenue the company expects to generate, only the size of the potential opportunity. Using the current expected sequential growth rate of 7% , Broadcom’s AI-chip business would be worth around $18 billion by the end of 2025. If it grows at a compound annual growth rate of 44% in 2026 and 2027, at the same rate it expects next quarter, the company’s AI revenue could reach $37 billion by 2027.This would mean it would need to capture about half of this SAM, at the midpoint. This would still be a tall task, but these numbers include only three customers. Overall, there is a significant chance Broadcom could sustain a powerful +40% AI growth rate for multiple years.The company also has a non-AI chip business that is almost as large as its AI-chip business. This business has been shrinking, and so has the non-AI chip industry overall. But, the semiconductor industry is cyclical, so there is a strong chance of a significant recovery.Broadcom’s Software Business Proves It's Not a One-Trick Pony [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] Some say Broadcom's massive growth in software isn’t impressive. They argue it only happened because Broadcom paid $69 billion for VMware. While that is somewhat true when comparing overall software revenues from 2023 to 2024, it is a vast oversimplification. VMware’s revenues came onto the books in Q1 2024, causing Broadcom’s software revenues to increase by 153% versus Q4 2023. However, with the company’s Q1 2025 earnings release, we can see how well Broadcom grew its software revenues organically. They did a fantastic job, with Broadcom increasing software sales by 47%.This is due to key changes the company has made at VMware, and it has more to achieve with VMware. It is still working to shift the remaining 40% of customers to its higher revenue subscription model.The VMware acquisition shows how good the company is at spotting and fixing struggling businesses. This has been part of the company’s playbook for years now. Once Broadcom reduces the massive debt load it took on from VMware, the firm could be in a great position to do so again.This possibility is another reason to be confident in Broadcom’s long-term chances of continuing to appreciate.Broadcom: Strong Outlook and Execution Point to Good Things on the HorizonThe moment when Broadcom was a generational investment might be gone, but the stock still shows great promise. The company’s path to continued and strong growth is not theoretical, but entirely possible.Also, management’s impressive ability to acquire and reinvigorate companies like VMware can create long-term opportunities that are not considered today.Yes, the stock trades at a high multiple, but for good reason. The 28x forward P/E ratio is not outrageous . For long-term growth, Broadcom remains a buy.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:c03bf33bd094b:0-broadcom-buy-hold-sell-ai-acquistions-paint-strong-picture/

Broadcom vs. Marvell: Which Semiconductor Stock Has Greater Upside?,1747324080000,"Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL are key providers of semiconductor solutions for end markets, including AI-powered data centers and cloud service providers. Both offer custom AI accelerators (XPUs) that power AI deployment. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expects a double-digit growth rate in 2025, with semiconductor sales surging 19.1% to $627.6 billion in 2024. This offers significant growth opportunities for both Broadcom and Marvell.However, both AVGO and MRVL have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions amid tariff-related uncertainties. While Broadcom shares have climbed a modest 0.1% year to date, Marvell shares plunged 40.3%.AVGO and MRVL Stock’s PerformanceSo, Broadcom or Marvell, which is a better buy amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop? Let’s find out.Broadcom Rides on Strong Demand for XPUsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.MRVL’s Growing Data Center and Networking Market is PositiveMarvell’s custom AI silicon and electro-optics solutions have enabled it to become a leading player in the high-performance computing space. The company is benefiting from hyperscalers’ ramping up their use of custom silicon for AI workloads. In fiscal 2025, AI-based revenues crossed its $1.5 billion target, and Marvell expects to “very significantly” surpass its $2.5 billion AI revenue target in fiscal 2026. Marvell’s management is confident that revenues from its custom XPU solutions will continue expanding in fiscal 2027 and beyond.As AI workloads grow, data centers need enhanced networking and interconnect products. MRVL is capitalizing on this shift with its high-speed optical interconnects, including 800G PAM, 400ZR DCI, and its industry-first 1.6T PAM DSP (digital signal processor), which cuts down on optical module power usage by 20%.Furthermore, the shift from copper to optical connectivity in AI infrastructure represents a massive growth opportunity for the company. MRVL’s Co-Packaged Optics technology and its development of the industry's first 2nm silicon IP for cloud and AI workloads solidify its position in the next-generation networking space.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, MRVL’s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc. Price and ConsensusBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. QuoteHowever, the consensus mark for Marvell’s fiscal 2026 earnings has declined by a penny to $2.76 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 75.16% growth over fiscal 2025.Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMarvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. QuoteBoth AVGO’s and MRVL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Marvell’s average surprise of 4.25% is better than AVGO’s surprise of 3.44%, reflecting a good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: MRVL is Cheaper Than AVGOBoth Marvell and Broadcom are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Marvell shares are trading at 6.54X, lower than AVGO’s 16.12X.MRVL and AVGO ValuationAVGO is a Better Buy Right NowBroadcom’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential. Marvell’s near-term prospects are dull, as customers are rescheduling orders to manage excess chip inventories. The U.S. government’s export restriction on certain Chinese customers is likely to continue to be an overhang on Marvell’s top line.Currently, Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared with Marvell, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Product Expansion Powers Garmin's Outdoor Category Sales Growth in Q1,1746104820000,"Garmin Ltd. GRMN delivered a strong start to fiscal 2025, fueled by an impressive performance in its Outdoor segment. While overall first-quarter results were mixed, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenues and earnings, the company still posted an 11% year-over-year increase in total sales, reaching a record $1.54 billion. Much of that growth came from the Outdoor business, which is quickly becoming Garmin’s most important and profitable unit.In the first quarter, Outdoor segment sales jumped 20% year over year to $438 million, leading all five operating segments in both growth and absolute revenues. Even more notable, the segment generated $129 million in operating income, up 20% from the prior year, with strong gross and operating margins of 64% and 29%, respectively. This performance highlights not only rising demand but also Garmin’s ability to deliver profitability through premium, purpose-built devices.Product Expansion Drives Garmin’s Outdoor SalesGarmin’s sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio has been driving the Outdoor category’s overall performance. The company aggressively expanded its adventure-focused product lineup during the first quarter, targeting niche outdoor sports and lifestyle categories where the brand already has a strong following.The standout release was the Instinct 3 series, a refreshed line of adventure watches now offering a bright AMOLED display. Garmin also introduced new devices in the dive (Descent G2), tactical (tactix 8) and golf (Approach S44/S50) categories, each designed to serve dedicated use cases.This strategy of deepening product offerings within specific activity verticals is clearly paying off. It allows Garmin to better serve enthusiasts who value specialized features and are willing to pay a premium for reliable performance in challenging conditions.The company also launched new handheld GPS products like the Montana series with SOS satellite functionality, as well as the solar-powered Approach G20 GPS for golfers, billed as the first of its kind with unlimited battery life in sunlight.Garmin Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Garmin Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Garmin Ltd. QuoteOutdoor: Garmin’s Most Profitable Growth EngineThe success of the Outdoor segment is especially valuable for Garmin right now as other parts of the business face more uneven conditions. For instance, Marine revenues declined 2% in the first quarter due to promotional timing, while Aviation grew a modest 3%.The Auto OEM segment gained 31% but remains the least profitable, with a $9 million operating loss in the quarter. Fitness, meanwhile, saw a healthy 12% increase thanks to demand for wearables, but its margins trailed those of Outdoor.Outdoor’s high-margin profile gives Garmin a financial cushion and enhances overall earnings quality. It also helps the company absorb macro pressures like U.S.-China tariff impacts, which are estimated to raise annual costs by roughly $100 million. Despite those headwinds, Garmin maintained its full-year EPS guidance at $7.80, a sign of confidence that strengths like Outdoor can support the bottom line.

"These 2 Chip Stocks Could Be Better Bets Than Nvidia, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1746022500000,"By Adam ClarkWhile Nvidia is the unquestioned leader in artificial-intelligence chips, it could be time to buy shares of its rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom for the next phase of the AI trade, according to Seaport Research Partners.As Nvidia's customers start to seek greater return on investment on their AI spending, then the difficulties of deploying its most advanced systems could become a drawback, according to Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg.Goldberg initiated coverage of Nvidia with a Sell rating and a $100 target price in a research note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, he gave Broadcom a Buy rating and a $230 target price and AMD a Buy rating and $100 target price.Nvidia shares were down 3.6% in morning trading. Broadcom stock fell 2.7% and AMD dropped 3%, as technology stocks suffered amid a raft of weak economic data on Wednesday.""Nvidia is one of the leading beneficiaries of the current AI spending boom, but its prospects are well understood and largely priced into the stock,"" Goldberg wrote.For Broadcom, the positives are directly related to its growing role in AI chips, as it helps large companies, such as Alphabet's Google unit and Meta Platforms, design custom chips.""Any time Nvidia loses share today it is to hyperscalers' internal chip designs, and Broadcom is poised to make a lot of money helping them bring those chips to production,"" Goldberg wrote.Meta executives said recently that its in-house MTIA chips could replace graphics-processing units — the specialty of Nvidia — in some servers and be expanded to power AI training. So far, custom chips have generally been used mainly for inference, the process of generating answers or results from the models, rather than training.The upside for AMD is less directly related to the AI sector. The company is unlikely to gain significant market share from Nvidia in the short term, but it is gradually building up a portfolio to match its larger rival, Goldberg said. It can continue to benefit by taking market share from Intel in data centers more generally, he wrote.""AMD needs to be measured for its execution to roadmap and not its AI sales which we expect to be modest but growing over time,"" the analyst wrote.AMD is expected to launch the MI350 GPU series in the second half of the year. AMD has said the MI350 will deliver 35 times more performance for inference than older chips.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Broadcom Set to Surge as AI Diffusion Rule Ends,1747316880000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Over approximately the last three weeks, markets have been on the rise big-time. The  S&P 500 closed just under $5,900 on May 14, just around 4% lower than the all-time high it reached in February. As market sentiment shifts, Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , a leading semiconductor stock , has emerged as a top beneficiary. Despite at one point being down nearly 38% in 2025, Broadcom is now just slightly in the green this year as of the May 14 close.The announcement of the trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted the stock. Shares jumped almost 12% within two days after the announcement. However, there were other highly positive recent pieces of news for Broadcom that the trade deal may somewhat overshadow.Most notable is that President Trump is ending the Biden-era “AI Diffusion Rule."" Its end has the potential to substantially benefit companies like Broadcom . So, what exactly was the AI Diffusion Rule , and what does its cancellation mean for Broadcom?Understanding the End of AI Diffusion, NVIDIA and AMD See Immediate BenefitThe purpose of the AI Diffusion Rule was to give the U.S. government extensive control over which countries can and cannot get access to advanced AI chips made by American firms . Specifically, it controls chips used to train advanced AI models.The rule categorized countries into three different tiers. Tier 1 countries included many of America’s closest allies. These countries face no restrictions. Tier 2 countries include most other countries. India, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were notable inclusions.These countries were limited in the number of chips they could buy. Tier 3 countries , which include adversaries like China and Russia, were not allowed to buy any advanced chips.Really, the government was trying to specifically prevent China and Russia from getting these chips to slow the advancement of their AI capabilities. With the ending of AI Diffusion , that isn’t likely to change. However, how the United States treats those Tier 2 countries is changing. NVIDIA's NASDAQ:NVDA announcement that it would sell 18,000 of its most advanced chips to Saudi Arabia on the same day the government eliminated the AI Diffusion rule provides evidence of this.Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a huge AI partnership in the country.Overall, the end of AI Diffusion means that chip companies with significant AI capabilities now have a much larger opportunity to sell their most advanced technology to these Tier 2 countries. Many of these countries are extremely wealthy, adding to the size of the opportunity . This extends to Broadcom, but in a slightly different way than NVIDIA and AMD.The End of AI Diffusion: Broadcom Waits Its Turn to CapitalizeBroadcom's custom chips are largely used for AI model inference, rather than primarily for AI model training. Training comes before inference. For countries like Saudi Arabia, this means they need time to train their models with NVIDIA and AMD chips . After that, Broadcom's chips can really make a difference. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO]Thus, the fact that NVIDIA and AMD are striking deals opens up the door for Broadcom to sell large amounts of chips to Tier 2 countries down the line. How long that might take is hard to say, but a big opportunity now exists for Broadcom nonetheless.The benefit to Broadcom comes even though the company hasn’t expressed concerns about AI Diffusion, at least with a specific set of customers. In the company’s last earnings call , Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon specifically asked about this.Rasgon asked whether AI diffusion would impact Broadcom’s design wins or shipments for the three big AI customers the firm is selling to in volume.In response, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said, “To answer your question directly, no, we don't have any concerns."" This underscores Broadcom’s focus on inference chips , which AI Diffusion did not directly impact. However, they were indirectly impacted because training comes before inference. So, with AI Diffusion ending, the positive impact on Broadcom comes from the expansion of its serviceable market.The End of AI Diffusion Adds Another Broadcom TailwindFor the reasons discussed above, Broadcom can win big due to AI Diffusion ending . Its chips now have a strong path forward to getting into the hands of some of these huge Tier 2 countries. But, cashing in will likely take time.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:bbce48cea094b:0-broadcom-set-to-surge-as-ai-diffusion-rule-ends/

TSMC Stock Gets Trump Boost. Intel Thinks It Knows How to Strike Back. — Barrons.com,1746015300000,"By Adam ClarkTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is basking in the approval of the Trump administration for its U.S. investment plans. Intel faces an uphill struggle to compete but has detailed its plan to regain leadership in chip manufacturing, involving a costly bet on new machinery.Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, has claimed the role of the world's leading manufacturer of advanced chips. Now it is planning to spend a total of $165 billion on U.S. factories as it looks to simultaneously defuse the threat of U.S. tariffs on imported semiconductors and Chinese efforts to claim the self-ruled island of Taiwan.The American investment plan has won it the backing of the White House, underlined on Tuesday when Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick visited TSMC's site in Arizona where the company was breaking ground on a third chip-fabrication facility.""We are at TSMC Arizona to celebrate the return of American manufacturing. President Trump's bold leadership and clear direction are driving companies and jobs back to this country at a record pace,"" Lutnick said in a statement.The public endorsement could allay fears TSMC will face levies on its Taiwan-made chips. President Donald Trump has publicly stated he told the company it could face a tax of up to 100% if it doesn't shift more production to the U.S.American depositary receipts of TSMC were rising 1.5% in premarket trading on Wednesday, with the ADRs down 17% so far this year through Tuesday's close.What's good news for TSMC is likely bad news for Intel, which would face an easier path to winning significant chip-manufacturing business if its Taiwanese rival's products faced tariffs.However, Intel is hoping to prove it has superior technology with the 18A process it is launching this year and the next-generation 14A process where low-volume production is planned for 2027. It said Tuesday that multiple customers have said they would build test chips on the new process and noted that research, development, and wafer production will all be U.S.-based.""Intel is committed to building a world-class foundry that serves the growing need for leading-edge process technology, advanced packaging and manufacturing,"" said CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement.One notable difference between Intel and TSMC's plans is that the American company has acquired two of the most advanced lithography tools for manufacturing semiconductors on the market from Dutch company ASML Holding. The high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet, or High NA EUV, machines cost more than 350 million euros each, equivalent to about $398 million.TSMC has publicly been reluctant to order ASML's High NA EUV systems, citing its high cost, and suggested it could continue to use older machines for advanced chip manufacturing.That means there could be a window for Intel to secure a technological lead. However, the company still needs to prove it can attract external customers, with Nvidia and Broadcom reported to be running tests on its 18A process.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wolfspeed Stock Rises for Third Day. Why Shares Are Suddenly Surging. — Barrons.com,1747234200000,"By Brian SwintWolfspeed, the semiconductor firm that is trying to restructure its debt, looked set to rise for a third consecutive day Wednesday after a report that negotiations among creditors are happening.Apollo Global Management, one of the biggest holders of Wolfspeed's $6.5 billion of debt, is in talks with investment bank Moelis about a restructuring, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The stock plunged 26% Friday after the company said that it faces the risk of not being able to continue as a ""going concern"" on its latest earnings call.Wolfspeed rose 0.5% to $3.89 in Wednesday morning trading after gaining 16% on Tuesday and 1.8% Monday. Coming into the session, it was down almost 6% over the past five days and 42% lower in 2025.Wolfspeed makes silicon-carbide technology for use in the automotive industry and would stand to benefit from renewed interest in chips and artificial intelligence. Its problem is that it was due for funding under President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act that now looks doubtful under President Donald Trump. It has been one of the most shorted stocks on the market this year--short selling is when traders bet that the price of shares will fall.Other chip stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Big names Nvidia, AMD, and Arm were all rising, while others such as Broadcom and Intel were lower. Smaller chip maker Alpha & Omega was falling while peer Indie Semiconductor was rising.

AI-Driven Server and Storage Demand Likely to Boost SMCI's Q3 Earnings,1745927700000,"Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI is preparing to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results this week. Amid an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, the company is well-positioned for another quarter of strong revenue growth.Strong Server and Storage Demand to Fuel SMCI’s Sales GrowthThe Server and Storage Systems segment remains the cornerstone of Super Micro Computer’s financial strength. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.08 billion, marking a 37.4% rise compared to the year-ago quarter.The robust growth forecast is anticipated to have been driven largely by growing demand for graphics processing unit (GPU)-optimized servers tailored for AI workloads. SMCI has been capitalizing on strong customer interest in both air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled (DLC) rack-scale platforms, which are essential for the next wave of AI data center expansion.Super Micro Computer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Super Micro Computer, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Super Micro Computer, Inc. QuoteAnother key factor supporting the segment’s momentum is Super Micro Computer’s early availability of systems built on NVIDIA’s new Blackwell GPU architecture, alongside continued strength in Hopper-based systems. The expansion of the company’s Datacenter Building Block Solutions, which offers customers a one-stop integrated solution for servers, storage, networking and cooling, is expected to have further boosted adoption among enterprises and hyperscalers during the to-be-reported quarter.Leadership in DLC technology has also been a powerful competitive advantage for Super Micro Computer. As AI training models become more resource-intensive, data centers are increasingly adopting DLC solutions to meet energy efficiency and density requirements. This trend is likely to have boosted the Server and Storage Systems segment’s revenues in the third quarter.While margins are expected to have remained under pressure due to customer mix and ramping investments in next-generation platforms, the strong top-line growth in the Server and Storage Systems business is anticipated to have helped partially offset earnings headwinds.SMCI’s Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Super Micro Computer flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector are Pegasystems PEGA, Paycom Software PAYC and Broadcom AVGO, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pegasystems’ 2025 earnings has moved upward by 14 cents to $3.29 per share in the past seven days, reflecting 8.6% year-over-year growth. Pegasystems shares have risen 53.4% in the trailing 12 months.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paycom Software’s 2025 earnings has moved upward by 4 cents to $8.72 per share over the past 60 days, and suggests a year-over-year increase of 6.2%. Paycom Software shares have soared 20.5% over the past year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 4 cents to $6.60 per share in the past 30 days, suggesting an increase of 35.5% from fiscal 2024’s reported figure.

Quality Growth Stocks Make Sense for an Uncertain Economy — Barrons.com,1747164480000,"By Jacob SonenshineThis time is a little different.When the market rallies, investors usually want to own the riskiest stocks. But right now, the winning formula has changed: The best names to buy are good-quality companies that also have high potential for growth.The S&P 500 is up 17% from the low point it hit in its nasty decline in April. Areas that lost the most when expectations about the economy soured have led the way, rebounding faster as the picture has brightened. The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce sky-high tariffs that were choking off trade between the countries, and the White House has indicated that deals with other countries are on the way.That would mean reduced tariffs, less inflation, and more spending by consumers and businesses.At this point, investors looking for stocks to buy at today's prices should avoid economically sensitive, riskier industries such as retail, restaurants, or financials. They are now a hair above their levels just before President Donald Trump unveiled surprisingly high tariffs against a wide range of countries in early April, meaning they are no longer reflecting much potential economic weakness.Yet harder times are still a possibility. While Trump has partially rolled back tariffs, a 10% baseline tariff rate remains in place. Interest rates, all the while, have remained around 4%, where they have now hovered across various maturities for a few years . High rates take time to push consumer spending down, so that is a continuing source of pressure on consumers.Economic growth is more likely to slow down than to significantly accelerate.Given all that, strategists at UBS screened for higher-quality companies that can increase their earnings regardless, reasoning those stocks are likely to perform best as the economy adjusts to President Donald Trump's trade war.The bank looked for companies with four qualities. They had to have a market capitalization of at least $10 billion, higher expected earnings growth than most publicly traded companies, and trade at forward price/earnings multiples closer to their historical averages than most stocks. Finally, companies had to be of higher ""operational quality"" than most businesses.The latter means they have characteristics that enable them to consistently increase earnings. Those include pricing power — the ability to lift prices without damaging demand — and high profit margins, which insulate a company from losing money during recessions.Stocks that make the cut can be expected to offer growth at a reasonable price, or GARP. UBS's screen yielded six names: Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company; Broadcom; Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks; Cintas, which supplies uniforms and cleaning supplies to businesses; Heico, the dominant maker of aircraft parts; and Salesforce, the provider of cloud-based sales software.Analysts expect sales at Salesforce to rise by just over 9% annually to $49.1 billion by 2027, according to FactSet. If the economy stumbles, some customers may scale back their investments in new cloud-based technologies as they watch their budgets, but any cuts are likely to be mild. Companies need the newest, fastest, and most cost efficient technologies to make the most of sales opportunities.That is where Salesforce comes in. Its artificial intelligence agents give customers a reason to pay higher subscription prices for its software products, so its revenue growth is higher than for the average S&P 500 company.If the company remains disciplined with costs, that would help profit margins increase, sending earnings per share up about 13% annually over the coming three years, according to FactSet. That compares with the 11% in growth in the aggregate earnings expected for companies in the S&P 500.That kind of profit growth would likely push the stock higher because its price/earnings ratio isn't likely to drop much from its current level. Salesforce trades at about 25 times the earnings per share expected for the coming 12 months, about 14 points below its five-year average of about 39 times. The S&P 500 sells for 21 times, compared with the five-year average of 20 times.Buy GARP stocks. They are just a better deal than the ones that are, well, the riskiest.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

NYSE:NET , the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application.AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.Palo Alto Networks® NASDAQ:PANW , the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations.Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete.

Is Lam Research Stock a Buy Post Upbeat Q3 Earnings Performance?,1745866800000,"Lam Research Corporation LRCX recently posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, helping its shares rise 7% since the April 23 release. Lam Research, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, reported solid financials, surpassing market expectations and reaffirming its position in the industry amid ongoing fluctuations in the semiconductor cycle.The stock has declined 1.1% year to date (YTD) in a highly volatile 2025 market scenario, with positive momentum post earnings showing signs of stability and an attractive valuation relative to its industry peers. Nonetheless, LRCX has outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as key semiconductor peers such as Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL in the YTD period.YTD Price Return PerformanceFor investors considering their next move, here’s why buying Lam Research stock might be the most prudent approach now.Q3 Results Show Lam Research’s Financial ResilienceLam Research’s third-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, showcasing the company’s solid financial foundation. Total revenues reached $4.72 billion, a 24.5% increase year over year, underpinned by continued demand across the memory and logic segments. Despite a challenging backdrop for the semiconductor industry, Lam Research managed a non-GAAP EPS of $1.04, exceeding analyst forecasts and improving 33.5% from the year-ago quarter (adjusted for the stock split).Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation QuoteThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s third-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability even amid fluctuating end-market demand.Datacenter and AI Chip Demand to Fuel Growth for LRCXLam Research is benefiting from the booming demand for AI and datacenter chips, which require advanced fabrication technologies. The company’s deposition and etch solutions are critical for producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging technologies, which are essential for AI workloads.In 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion by 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents further growth opportunities for Lam’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.With AI-driven investments accelerating, Lam’s leading position in etch and deposition makes it a key beneficiary of the next semiconductor spending cycle.Strategic Investments Aid Lam Research’s ProspectsLam Research’s continued investment in research & development and product innovation is paying off.

Nvidia Stock Falls. This Huawei Breakthrough Won't Help. — Barrons.com,1745850540000,"By Adam ClarkNvidia stock was dropping Monday as the company prepares for a new challenge in the artificial-intelligence chip sector from China's Huawei Technologies.Nvidia shares were down 2% at $108.84 in morning trading, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The stock rose 4.3% in Friday's session.Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing a new chip, called the Ascend 910D, which it hopes will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia's H100 was released in 2022 and has since been superseded by later generations of its Hopper chips and its new Blackwell AI semiconductors.Nvidia is prohibited from selling its most powerful AI chips to Chinese companies. Huawei is already poised to ship more than 800,000 of its Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers including state-owned telecommunications carriers and private AI developers, such as TikTok's parent ByteDance, according to the Journal.Nvidia's market in China was already set to shrink after the Trump administration said it would impose license requirements on future sales of its H20 AI accelerators, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. sanctions on Chinese AI exports. In fiscal 2025, 13% of Nvidia's sales were from billing addresses in China, down from 26% in fiscal 2022.Outside of China, the challenge from Huawei could be limited as it continues to lag behind Nvidia's latest technology.""The only real threat that I see to Nvidia here is in China where the state's control over the private sector may ensure a switch away from Nvidia's CUDA [software] with developers learning how to use Huawei's development platforms instead,"" wrote Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who publishes Radio Free Mobile.One potential piece of good news for Nvidia is that one of its largest U.S. customers, Elon Musk's xAI, is seeking to raise $20 billion in funding, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. The AI start-up didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Monday.Plenty of that money could be spent on Nvidia's hardware if the reported funding takes place, as xAI has invested in hundreds of thousands of the company's chips to run its AI data centers.Nvidia also said Monday that the first of software-and-cloud computing company Oracle's liquid-cooled GB200 NVL72 racks, which stitch together dozens of Nvidia's chips, were ready for use by customers.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was up 0.1% and Broadcom was down 1.2% in morning trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia. ""Everything needs an accelerator,"" they wrote. Meanwhile, the stock's price-to-earnings multiple is near a five-year low, they said.-Britney NguyenThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Qualcomm currently has an ESP of +0.86% with a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors Shaping the Upcoming ResultsWith the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, Qualcomm is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets, driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. The company intends to harness artificial intelligence (AI) to meet increased demands for essential products and services that are the building blocks of digital transformation in a cloud economy. Qualcomm envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio.During the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI (artificial intelligence) desktops and laptops. This SoC (system-on-chip) is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Based on a 4-nanometer process, the Snapdragon X chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs – Microsoft Corporation ’s MSFT vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware. In the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm announced that Samsung, one of the major smartphone manufacturers in the world, deployed the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for its S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra devices. The advanced chip features the Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 Mobile Connectivity system and the Snapdragon X80 5G Modem-RF System, which ensure blazing fast 5G and WiFi 7 speeds. Qualcomm also extended its Snapdragon G Series portfolio with the addition of next-generation gaming chipsets. The 2025 product lineup includes Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chips. These initiatives are likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.Price PerformanceOver the past year, Qualcomm has lost 12.2% against the industry’s growth of 9.1%, lagging peers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO. While Broadcom has gained 43.6%, Hewlett Packard declined 5.5% over this period.Key Valuation MetricFrom a valuation standpoint, Qualcomm appears to be relatively cheaper compared to the industry and below its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 12.09 forward earnings, lower than 24.06 for the industry and the stock’s mean of 17.35. Investment ConsiderationsQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, the chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches. It is likely to help users experience a seamless transition to superfast 5G networks, delivering low-power, resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with unprecedented range and Qualcomm's best-in-class security. This, in turn, offers the flexibility and scalability needed for broad and fast 5G adoption through accelerated commercialization by OEMs. The company is reportedly the only chipset vendor with 5G system-level solutions spanning both sub-6 and millimeter wave bands and one of the largest RF (radio frequency) front-end suppliers with design wins across all premium-tier smartphone customers. Leveraging the technology roadmap for a focused approach to innovation, it aims to connect millions of devices to the ‘connected intelligent edge.’ In addition, solid growth opportunities within the mobile space led by innovations in the Snapdragon portfolio for premium-tier Android handsets and a firmer footing in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology with the Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems portfolio are tailwinds.End NoteWith solid fundamentals and healthy revenue-generating potential driven by robust demand trends, Qualcomm appears to be a solid investment proposition. It also looks cheaper relative to the industry. Further, a strong emphasis on quality, diligent execution of operational plans and continuous portfolio enhancements are driving more value for customers. With improving earnings estimates, the stock is witnessing a positive investor perception.Riding on a robust earnings surprise history and favorable Zacks Rank, it appears primed to record solid quarterly earnings. Hence, investors are likely to profit if they bet on this high-flying stock now.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:661c393a9094b:0-pre-q2-earnings-is-qcom-stock-a-portfolio-must-have/

Broadcom's VMware Deal Lifts AVGO Despite Complaints,1745838240000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom’s NASDAQ:AVGO acquisition of VMware has been a massive success . Broadcom has made many significant changes to extract value and improve VMware from a financial standpoint. So far, the changes have brought huge benefits to Broadcom.The semiconductor company reported revenue growth in its software segment of 47% last quarter, primarily due to VMware. Broadcom has also massively increased the profitability of VMware. In Aug. 2023, just before the acquisition, VMware had an adjusted operating margin of just under 29%. At the end of 2024, Broadcom’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said this figure hit 70% .Clearly, VMware has recently been a massive win for Broadcom. However, the changes Broadcom has implemented have left many customers incensed. The firm may be playing with fire long-term.The analysis below will detail Broadcom's changes to VMware to drive its success. It will also highlight the risks that Broadcom is taking on. Overall, Broadcom’s VMware strategy can continue adding significant value for the foreseeable future.Customers are Fighting Mad with Broadcom’s VMware ChangesBroadcom has made changes to VMware that are vast. It has cut the number of VMware employees approximately in half. It has also lowered the number of different packages offered from 8,000 to just four. However, the most impactful move has likely been the effort to switch customers to a subscription license rather than a perpetual one.This has caused many customers to see the price of their VMware service skyrocket. Price increases of 150% to 300% are on the lower end of the spectrum.Understandably, many are very unhappy with these changes. The fact that AT&T NYSE:T sued Broadcom in 2024 highlights this. It alleged that Broadcom didn’t honor the contract AT&T had with VMware prior to the acquisition. AT&T also said Broadcom quoted it a price increase of 1,050%.The companies have settled the lawsuit, but it epitomizes the sentiment of many customers regarding the VMware changes. Overall, this has resulted in many customers considering leaving VMware. One report suggests that nearly 52% of customers are mulling a breakup.The VMware changes have added great value to Broadcom. However, investors cannot ignore the real risk of losing many customers. However, considering leaving and actually doing so are two very different things. Evidence suggests that Broadcom might not be overplaying its hand, although customers are unhappy.VMware’s Stickiness Means Leaving Could Cause More Pain Than Benefit [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom’s ability to push these huge price increases comes from VMware’s dominance and the huge drawbacks of switching to another provider. Scott Bickley of Info-Tech Research Group suggests that at least 80% of enterprises use some form of VMware.This ubiquitous adoption creates a large ecosystem of skilled talent and partners that know VMware well. This reinforces its usage and makes it difficult to switch to alternatives. Bickley explains that VMware creates a “super-glue-style lock-in.” To switch from VMware, companies need to rework their whole tech environment. He also notes that VMware alternatives lack the same level of functionality.A study from Gartner looked at how long it would take to perform a VMware migration. It estimated a period of 18 to 48 months for a large enterprise to do so. Not only would this take a massive amount of time, but there could also be disruptions in operations while making the change.Overall, Gartner estimates that a migration from VMware could cost a large enterprise more than $6 million. This doesn’t sound like a massive sum to a large company. However, this figure doesn’t include the fact that a company must continue paying Broadcom while it does its migration.It could take a significant amount of time before overall costs start to come down. A.J. Thompson of the IT consultancy firm Northdoor says that he has seen few companies that are willing to take on the pain of migrating from VMware.Broadcom’s VMware Strategy Can Continue to Add ValueOverall, although customers are not pleased with Broadcom, it seems that the company understands its power. At this point, Broadcom’s VMware strategy seems likely to continue benefiting the stock for years to come. This is further bolstered by the sheer amount of time it would take for customers to leave VMware.If Broadcom noticed a sea of customers attempting to leave, it could likely adjust its strategy in time to stave this off.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:86041dd87094b:0-broadcom-s-vmware-deal-lifts-avgo-despite-complaints/

"Corporate America boosts security spending after UnitedHealth murder, filings show",1745830800000,"U.S. corporations have been ramping up their security spending, but following the murder of UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson that expenditure is set to rise further in 2025 as more companies see heightened threats to their top brass.At least a dozen S&P 500 companies have flagged an increase in security risks, a Reuters analysis of the proxy statements - or annual disclosures to shareholders - showed.Blue-chip companies such as Walmart NYSE:WMT , General Motors NYSE:GM , American Express NYSE:AXP and chipmaker Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO have disclosed new or increased security expenses from previous years.""The number of customers requiring assessments and executive protection has increased 10 to 15 times the number prior to December 4,"" said Glen Kucera, president at security services firm Allied Universal, which serves more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies.UnitedHealth NYSE:UNH spent $1.7 million on security for its top executives in 2024, the first time it disclosed the detail in its proxy statement on April 21. Its insurance unit CEO, Thompson, was shot dead on December 4 in a targeted attack in New York that raised fears among executives over threats to their safety. UnitedHealth rival Elevance Health NYSE:ELV cited an ""enhanced security risk environment"" to raise security benefits, while Johnson & Johnson NYSE:JNJ , Eli Lilly NYSE:LLY , and pharmacy chain Walgreens NASDAQ:WBA reported additional expenses. Of the 208 S&P 500 companies that have filed their annual proxy statement for fiscal 2024, about 31.3% of them granted a security perk to at least one of their named executive officers, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm.That expense rose to a median of $94,276, up from $69,180 in 2023, based on disclosures from roughly a quarter of the companies. In 2022, when 23.1% of companies reported security spending, the median was $40,917, Equilar told Reuters.Because Thompson's murder took place late in the year, compensation experts said proxy statements for 2025 will likely show an even greater increase in security spending.""We anticipate that security-related costs and perquisites will likely increase in terms of the amount of imputed income that's disclosed in proxies but also the prevalence,"" said David Kokell, head of U.S. compensation research at Institutional Shareholder Services. TOP EXECUTIVE THREATCEOs and other prominent executives can become lightning rods for anger directed toward broader organizations, leading to more spending on security, even though it is still a small fraction of a company's annual business expenses.General Motors said increased security would be offered to CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss after a recent assessment. Broadcom spent $1.37 million on CEO Hock Tan's security in 2024 but did not give the number for prior years, while credit card giant American Express' spending on security perks more than doubled from 2023 and is expected to increase in 2025. Other companies that boosted protection include utility companies Edison International NYSE:EIX and CenterPoint Energy NYSE:CNP , as well as Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD .A vast majority of companies do not outline their security costs. Only 18% of S&P 500 and 5% of Russell 3000 companies disclosed personal and home security as a CEO compensation perquisite, according to 2024 data from The Conference Board. A full picture of the increase in spending will only emerge by September when more companies file their reports or next year, analysts said.Companies are also expanding the security cover to more executives and public events, experts said in the aftermath of Thompson's murder, which took place outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealth was holding an investor conference. The scope ""has actually expanded"", John Gainer, vice president at security firm TorchStone Global, said. ""It starts with the CEO, then the C-suite, and now increasingly includes the board—especially when it comes to public-facing events like board or shareholder meetings.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QS0E9:0-corporate-america-boosts-security-spending-after-unitedhealth-murder-filings-show/"

Nvidia Stock Rises. What Alphabet and Intel Earnings Mean for the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1745592180000,"By Adam Clark and Tae KimNvidia was climbing early Friday as the market digested earnings reports from Alphabet and rival chip maker Intel.Strong demand for artificial intelligence technology looks to bode well for the leading AI semiconductor company.Nvidia shares were up 1.2% at $107.70 in early trading Friday. The stock rose 3.6% on Thursday.Alphabet earnings on Thursday were being closely watched for any signs of a slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure. Nvidia investors should be reassured by the company holding its outlook for capital expenditure this year at $75 billion.Alphabet executives said they finished the quarter with more demand for cloud-computing services than the company had capacity to serve. They reiterated that Alphabet has a ""strong relationship"" with Nvidia, even as it continues to improve its own in-house AI chips.Meanwhile, the prospect of serious competition in AI chips from Intel still seems remote. While new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company will aim to build ""full stack AI solutions"" — spanning hardware, software and services — of the type that Nvidia already offers, he didn't put a timeline on when it might bring a competitive AI processor to the market.In January, Intel announced it wouldn't bring its next AI data center product Falcon Shores to market. Instead, it said it would focus its efforts on developing another product called Jaguar Shores.""We still have a Jaguar Shores product on our road map...We know that is a segment of the data center market that we're not competing in today, and we need a robust portfolio as all the customers are looking for alternatives,"" said Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel's Product business, on a call with analysts on Thursday.On Friday, Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst Joseph Moore also dismissed concerns that demand for AI chips is weakening. ""The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand,"" he wrote.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom both fell 0.5% in early trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Zacks.com featured highlights Broadcom and Primoris Services,1745570880000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 25, 2025 – Stocks in this week’s article are Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Primoris Services PRIM.2 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks That Boast Solid Growth PotentialWall Street has been exhibiting wild swings, driven by growing uncertainty around the new U.S. administration’s economic tariffs. These tariffs are expected to drive up consumer prices, thus curbing spending and weighing on the U.S. economy. In such a scenario, investors have become defensive and shifted their focus to products that provide stability and safety in a rocky market. As a result, the appeal for dividend stocks has risen.Though these stocks do not offer dramatic price appreciation, they tend to outperform in a choppy market and can reduce the volatility of a portfolio. In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Two stocks — Broadcom Inc. and Primoris Services — seem solid choices in this regard.Here are two of the three stocks that fit the bill:California-based Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices focused on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

Micron vs. Broadcom: Which Stock is the Smarter Semiconductor Bet?,1747058760000,"Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO are both entrenched in high-growth semiconductor arenas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and cloud infrastructure, but they take radically different paths to capture value. Micron is a dominant memory chip maker, while Broadcom specializes in networking, custom silicon and infrastructure software.Both companies have seen share price fluctuations in 2025 amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While MU shares have risen 2% year to date, AVGO dropped 10.2%. Yet with AI adoption accelerating, which stock stands out as the smarter semiconductor investment today? Let’s find out.Micron: AI Memory Boom Aids, Margin Worries LingerMicron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, Micron revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Despite Micron's efforts to capitalize on rising AI-related demand, margin pressures and pricing challenges raise red flags. While Micron’s top-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was impressive, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Broadcom: Profitable, Predictable and Primed for AIMeanwhile, Broadcom offers investors a more diversified and durable growth profile. The company is deeply embedded in next-generation AI infrastructure through its custom application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) and high-performance networking chips, which are fueling its top-line growth.Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require a complex integration of compute, memory and I/O capabilities to achieve the essential performance at lower power consumption and costs. Broadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion.What’s more impressive is that Broadcom is already sampling the world’s first 3nm XPU chips and plans to launch a 2nm version using advanced 3.5D packaging later this year. The company targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. It believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric.Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Super Micro Computer, has been a key catalyst.From a financial perspective, Broadcom consistently delivers gross margins above 70% and operating margins above 60%, driven by its high-value custom silicon business and enterprise software portfolio. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP EPS soared 45.5% on 25% higher revenues. Looking forward, Broadcom expects total revenues in the second quarter to surge 19% year over year to $14.9 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: MU Picks Up Steam, AVGO Holds SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Micron’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 41% and 433%, respectively. However, the estimate revision trend for MU’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS has remained highly volatile.Micron EPS Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 21% and 36%, respectively. However, unlike Micron, estimates for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS have demonstrated a steady upward revision trend. This stability is a testament to the company’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.Broadcom EPS Estimate Revision TrendValuation: MU is Cheaper, but AVGO Deserves the PremiumMicron is trading at a forward sales multiple of 2.24X, way below Broadcom’s 14.48X.Broadcom does seem pricey compared to Micron. However, AVGO’s higher valuation is backed by superior profitability and a structurally more diversified business. The company boasts steady gross and operating margins compared to MU’s more variable margin profile.Micron’s falling profitability raises questions about its ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Conclusion: Broadcom is the Better Long-Term PlayBoth Micron and Broadcom are riding the same megatrends — AI, cloud and data centers — but they’re doing so from vastly different positions of strength.Micron has upside potential due to its leadership in AI memory. However, that promise is being weighed down by margin pressure and pricing volatility. It’s still a play on memory cycles more than a structural AI winner.Meanwhile, Broadcom brings more stability to the table with strong fundamentals, durable earnings, and a balanced mix of AI-driven hardware and enterprise software. While its valuation is higher, it’s supported by margin strength and earnings consistency.So, for investors seeking a smarter semiconductor bet amid global uncertainty, Broadcom remains the more compelling choice.Currently, AVGO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared to MU, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Two stocks — Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Primoris Services PRIM — seem solid choices in this regard.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. A history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth Greater Than Zero : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth Greater Than Zero : This represents stocks with a strong record of revenue growth.5-Year Historical EPS Growth Greater Than Zero : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate Greater Than Zero : This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow Less Than M-Industry : A ratio less than M-industry indicates that a stock is undervalued in that industry, and an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by a company.52-Week Price Change Greater Than S&P 500 (Market Weight) : This ensures that a stock has appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank : Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in every market environment.Growth Score of B or Better : Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.These few criteria have narrowed down the universe from more than 7,700 stocks to just 3.Here are two of the three stocks that fit the bill:California-based Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices focused on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

"Semiconductor, Chip Stocks Rally on U.S.-China Trade Deal — Update",1747058640000,"By Dean Seal and Denny JacobShares of semiconductor and chip companies are moving higher after the U.S. and China agreed to dramatically scale back sky-high tariffs on each other's goods.Shares of Nvidia were up 3.9% at $121.15, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing shares rose 4.8% to $184.97. Shares of Qualcomm were up 3.6% at $150.36, while shares of Broadcom were up 4.9% at $218.45.The semiconductor sector has been under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war kicked off by the Trump administration this year. While President Trump didn't issue direct tariffs on chipmakers, most chips are exported to China or other countries where they are assembled into servers and computer equipment that were expected to face tariffs when shipped to the U.S.Chip companies saw similar gains in early trading Monday. Marvell Technology rose 6.4% to $63.48, while Micron Technology jumped 7.6% to $92.39. Advanced Micro Devices rose 5.7% to $108.67, while Super Micro Computer gained 7.9% to $34.52.After weekend talks in Geneva, the countries said Monday that Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariff on China would be slashed to 10% from 125% and that the reductions would last for 90 days while negotiations are ongoing.The agreement came faster than expected and eased tariff levels more than Wall Street had anticipated, sending U.S. stocks higher.Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250512006033:0-semiconductor-chip-stocks-rally-on-u-s-china-trade-deal-update/

Chip Stocks Rally on U.S.-China Trade Deal,1747056960000,"By Dean SealShares of semiconductor companies are moving higher after the U.S. and China agreed to dramatically scale back sky-high tariffs on each other's goods.Shares of Nvidia were up 4.4% at $121.76 ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rose 5.9% to $186.89. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 7.8% to $110.84. Shares of Qualcomm were up 6.2% at $154.12. Shares of Broadcom were up 5.8% at $220.21.The semiconductor sector has been under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war kicked off by the Trump administration this year. While President Trump didn't issue direct tariffs on chipmakers, most chips are exported to China or other countries where they are assembled into servers and computer equipment that were expected to face tariffs when shipped to the U.S.After weekend talks in Geneva, the countries said Monday that Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariff on China would be slashed to 10% from 125% and that the reductions would last for 90 days while negotiations are ongoing.The agreement came faster than expected and eased tariff levels more than Wall Street had anticipated, sending U.S. stock futures higher.

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Broadcom Stock Down 11% in a Month: Should You Buy the Dip?,1745434800000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have dropped 11.4% in the past month. The company has been suffering from the ongoing sell-off in technology stocks amid rising fears of a recession following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on top trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada, which has increased the chances of a trade war. Broadcom generated roughly 20% of net revenues from shipments to China (including Hong Kong) in fiscal 2024.However, we believe the dip offers a massive opportunity for investors to buy the stock. An innovative portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business and strong balance sheet, as well as free cash flow generating ability, are attractive for growth-oriented investors. Let’s dig deep to find out more.AVGO Stock Performance  Strong Portfolio to Boost Broadcom’s ProspectsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. AVGO’s innovative portfolio is a key catalyst. The company’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies DELL, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Growing Security Portfolio Aids AVGOBroadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.Last week, AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Meanwhile, Broadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 0.6% over the past 30 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc. Stock Price and ConsensusBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. QuoteThe consensus estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating 42.73% year-over-year growth.AVGO’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.44%.

We believe these factors justify the premium valuation.Broadcom currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Growth Score of B, a favorable combination that offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology.

A new threat has also emerged: President Trump's recent comments calling for 100% tariffs on films produced outside of the U.S.Disney shares jumped 11% Wednesday, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Berkshire HathawayThe Oracle of Omaha is retiring.At the conclusion of Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3, legendary investor Warren Buffett said he plans to step down as chief executive in December.Greg Abel, who has been on deck to succeed Buffett as CEO since 2021, will take the reins on Jan. 1. Buffett will remain the conglomerate's chairman.Buffett, who is 94, has led the company for the past 60 years. His retirement announcement surprised shareholders, as many thought that Buffett would remain CEO until his death.Berkshire shares lost 5.1% Monday.Ford MotorFord and Mattel joined the growing group of companies scrapping annual guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.Ford on Tuesday reported a steep decline in quarterly profit and suspended its annual guidance, saying it couldn't predict the full impact of President Trump's levies. The automaker said tariffs could cut $1.5 billion from a key measure of profit.Mattel also scrapped its annual forecast. The maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels said it could increase U.S. toy prices, as the company is bracing for a $270 million tariff hit. Mattel is also moving more of its production out of China.Ford shares rose 2.7% Tuesday, while Mattel gained 2.9%.Cleveland-CliffsAs President Trump seeks to build up American steel demand, one of the major U.S. steelmakers is shrinking.Cleveland-Cliffs on Wednesday said it would pause or slow operations at six plants after posting a wider first-quarter loss and lower revenue. The production cuts and changes in operations are expected to affect about 2,000 jobs and save the steelmaker $300 million a year.While steel prices climbed as customers bought up steel ahead of Trump's tariffs on imported metal, that rally has stalled. Now, buyers are holding off on placing big orders in an uncertain U.S. economy.Cleveland-Cliffs shares plummeted 16% Thursday.BroadcomU.S. chip stocks got a boost, thanks to the possibility of a reprieve from tight export controls.The Trump administration plans to overhaul controversial regulations that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips individual countries can buy, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.A White House spokeswoman said that the Commerce Department plans to replace the rule — commonly known as AI diffusion — which was set to go into effect May 15.The decision is a temporary boon for the tech titans, but many executives are still bracing for tight restrictions. The Trump administration recently cracked down on Nvidia selling a specialized AI chip to China, causing the company to take a $5.5 billion charge.Broadcom shares rose 1.5% Thursday.BoeingThe new U.S. trade deal with the U.K. includes some good news for Boeing.President Trump on Thursday announced that his administration and the U.K. had made a trade deal pact, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a British airline would buy $10 billion worth of Boeing planes.In exchange for the U.K. purchasing the jets and giving American farmers greater access to U.K. markets, the Trump administration agreed to roll back tariffs imposed on British steel and automobiles. The U.K. is also cutting tariffs on some U.S. beef imports and on ethanol.On Friday, British Airways owner IAG said it has ordered 32 Boeing planes, confirming purchases touted by Lutnick the day before.Boeing shares gained 3.3% Thursday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

Last year, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 employees.In midmorning trading, the stock was up 7.0% at $20.87. It has dropped 43% over the past 12 months.Tan was appointed CEO last month and is looking to prioritize its core chip design and chip-manufacturing businesses. While he was widely expected to implement substantial job cuts, theIntel's first-quarter earnings come on Thursday. It is expected to report a net loss of $987 million, according to FactSet; on an adjusted basis, the forecast is a $9 million profit.Intel executives said recently that the company had begun low-volume testing on its new 18A chip-manufacturing process, which it hopes will give it a technological lead against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.""We do see downside for Intel as somewhat limited with investors in our view more likely to focus on the potential for 1) a split of Intel's fab and design businesses (a result we see as unlikely for now), and 2) Intel's progress with 18A,"" wrote Wedbush analysts on Wednesday.The Wedbush team kept a Neutral rating on the stock but reduced its price target to $19 from $20.While producing Intel's own chips will provide some validation for its costly chip-manufacturing efforts, the real test will be whether it can attract significant external customers for the 18A process. Nvidia and Broadcom are running tests on the process, Reuters reported previously.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Nvidia, AMD, and Other Chip Stocks Rally. Tariffs Fears Are Lifting — but There Is Another Concern to Watch. — Barrons.com",1745418780000,"By Adam ClarkNvidia stock jumped 4.4% early Wednesday amid a broader market rally after President Donald Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on China to reach a deal.The chip maker's shares were trading around $103.25 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Tuesday. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.7% and Broadcom was up 5.2% in morning trading. The iShares Semiconductor exchange-traded fund was up 5.7%.President Trump on Tuesday said U.S.-imposed tariffs of 145% on imported goods from China will come down ""substantially"" after the two sides negotiate a deal. The Nasdaq Composite was up 3.9%.While lower tariffs on China won't have much of a direct effect on Nvidia, which sources the majority of its chips from Taiwan, it could reduce fears over retaliation and the potential level of sector-specific levies on imported semiconductors. Trump has said additional tariffs on semiconductors are coming, and the administration has restricted Nvidia's chip sales in China. The administration also hasn't made clear how it intends to apply former President Joe Biden's so-called AI diffusion rules to control chip exports before they take effect on May 15.""In our view, the upcoming AI Diffusion Rule remains the biggest near-term risk, with our worst-case scenario assuming another 10% sales and up to 11% of EPS [earnings per share] shaved off from our new base case,"" wrote BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya in a research note.Arya kept a Buy rating on Nvidia stock, noting it is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of around 19 times its forecast profit for 2026.

Micron Stock Plunges 28% in a Month: Should You Hold or Exit?,1745412900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU shares have plunged 27.8% over the past month and underperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which is down 13.9%. MU stock has also underperformed major semiconductor players, including Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.MU One-Month Price Return PerformanceThis steep decline raises the question: Should investors cut their losses and exit, or is the stock worth holding onto? While the near-term headwinds are real, MU’s long-term growth story remains intact, making a strong case for holding the stock.Why Did Micron Struggle?The company’s recent slump is part of a larger tech pullback triggered by fears of an escalating tariff war and slowing economic growth. The situation is compounded by a growing concern over its deteriorating gross margin.In its latest financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9% from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning for the investors was the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This dim outlook indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist in the near term.Despite these challenges, Micron’s dominant market position and promising long-term outlook make it a stock worth holding onto.Micron’s Promising Long-Term OutlookWhile near-term profitability guidance is uninspiring, Micron’s long-term prospects are bright. Should the company hit its third-quarter targets, it would still reflect impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 427% for fiscal 2025 and 58% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMicron’s strategic position in the memory and storage chip market, a critical component for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, positions it to capitalize on an expected surge in AI-related capital expenditures over the coming years.Positive Industry Trends Aid Micron’s ProspectsMicron’s position in high-demand segments such as AI, data center, automotive and industrial IoT places it at the forefront of the semiconductor industry's evolution. The explosion of AI applications has significantly increased demand for advanced memory solutions, such as DRAM and NAND. Micron’s investments in cutting-edge DRAM and 3D NAND technologies ensure it remains competitive and poised to capitalize on these trends.Micron’s diversification strategy is noteworthy. By reducing reliance on consumer electronics, which are more susceptible to demand swings, and focusing on stable sectors like automotive and data centers, Micron mitigates revenue volatility. This balance reinforces its resilience in an industry often impacted by cyclical trends.Additionally, Micron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, MU revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Valuation: Micron is UndervaluedValuation-wise, Micron is undervalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of B.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 1.86X, significantly lower than the sector’s 5.06X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 11.88X, 11.79X and 4.17X, respectively.Conclusion: Hold Micron for NowMicron’s recent sell-off reflects short-term headwinds, but the long-term growth story remains compelling. With its strong positioning in AI and data center markets, along with an attractive valuation, holding Micron stock is the prudent choice for investors willing to navigate near-term volatility.Currently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Wolfspeed Stock Plunges as Analysts Weigh In. Chip Maker's Debt Is the Worry. — Barrons.com,1746805020000,"By Brian SwintShares of semiconductor maker Wolfspeed plunged Friday as Wall Street analysts issued negative research on the stock.Earnings that came in line with expectations weren't enough to reassure investors concerned with the company's debt levels.The problem is that Wolfspeed, which produces silicon wafers in the U.S., was promised $750 million under former President Joe Biden's Chips Act. Receiving it may be a problem as President Donald Trump tries to undo his predecessor's work. At the same time, the company has a $575 million payment due to creditors next year.Short interest in Wolfspeed, a measure of how much of a company's stock has been borrowed for bets that the price would drop, has taken off this year. The shares went through a short squeeze last month as investors bid up the stock price, forcing short sellers to buy to close out their bearish bets.Wolfspeed is slimming down its management team by 30%, the company said Thursday during its first earnings call with new CEO Robert Feurle. Chairman Tom Werner said the company is still working with lenders ""to address our capital structure so that Wolfspeed has a strong financial foundation."" Executives didn't take questions from analysts.CFO Neill Reynolds, on the earnings call, said Wolfspeed will start naming the risk of continuing as a ""going concern"" in future filings as it negotiates with creditors, possibly in court.Wolfspeed shares plunged 26% to $3.30 Friday. The stock has traded as high as about $7.50 this year and as low as about $2.50. Shares have lost more than 80% in the past 12 months.William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer suspended coverage of the company, withdrawing the firm's previous Market Perform rating.Others stuck with coverage but downgraded the shares.""Wolfspeed faces significant financial challenges in a sluggish macro environment with financial losses, high leverage, Chips Act funding challenges underpinning doubts over going concern,"" said Atif Malik, an analyst at Citigroup. The bank cut its target price to $3 from $7 and downgraded the stock to Sell.J.P. Morgan analysts Samik Chatterjee and Joseph Cardoso downgraded the stock to Underweight in a note Friday morning, without giving a price target. It will be hard for the company to reach its goal of generating positive cash flow in the coming fiscal year, they wrote.Over at Charter Equity Research, analyst Jack Egan rates the shares Market Underperform. ""Difficulties refinancing the debt, continued cash burn and slowing demand in materials increased the specter of bankruptcy and will depress the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Egan wrote.Piper Sandler analysts led by Harsh Kumar weren't as pessimistic, but did move their price target to $6 after the results. ""WOLF has many steps ahead of itself to complete its turnaround but is course-correcting appropriately at this time,"" they wrote in a note.Wolfspeed competes with chip makers like Alpha & Omega and Indie Semiconductor, both of whose shares rose Friday. All are substantially smaller than well-known chip companies such as Nvidia, Intel, and Broadcom.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

CRDO Tanks 33% in 3 Months: Should You Hold the Stock or Make an Exit?,1746798420000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd CRDO stock has slipped 33.3% over the past three months, significantly more than the Electronic-Semiconductors industry’s decline of 16.4%. The broader Computer and Technology sector and S&P 500 Composite have registered declines of 11.5% and 7.8%, respectively, over the same time frame. The markets since April have been affected by evolving U.S. trade policy and diminishing macroeconomic visibility. Price PerformanceCRDO gained 6.1% yesterday and closed trading at $51.39, but the stock is down 41% below its 52-week high of $86.69. This is likely to spook investors as they contemplate how to strategize their investment now. The natural question is: Should you stay invested or exit now? Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this AI stock and see whether it is worth staying invested or not.AI Boom to Drive CRDO Top LineCredo is a provider of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the data infrastructure market. Amid exponential data growth and rapid AI proliferation, market demand for faster and energy-efficient connectivity solutions continues to increase. This bodes well for Credo.One of Credo’s key strengths lies in its Active Electrical Cables (AEC) product line, which posted triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The growth is driven by its increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.CRDO Focuses on Product LaunchesCredo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include a portfolio of PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. The company expects the PCIe products to considerably expand its total addressable market. This expansion into PCIe connectivity further solidifies the company's competitive positioning in the high-performance computing and AI markets.Momentum in the optical business, particularly for Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. In April 2025, CRDO unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.Growing Demand for RetimersCRDO’s PCIe retimers and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo Technology for significant future revenue growth. CRDO Provides Strong Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO reported $135 million in revenues, up 87% sequentially and 154% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%. This surge was mainly driven by its largest hyperscale customer, which significantly scaled the production of AI platforms, reflecting the growing demand for AI-powered connectivity solutions.Challenges Aplenty for CRDODespite Credo’s strong performance and innovative solutions, several challenges pose headwinds to its prospects. CRDO’s business is heavily tilted toward AI-related infrastructure and the hyperscale cloud market spending. While these segments are currently experiencing high growth, they are also cyclically dependent on AI capex spending, which could decelerate after initial buildouts.Credo’s non-GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter surged 16% sequentially to $43.8 million, primarily due to higher headcount. Increasing costs could become a problem if the revenue growth does not keep pace.In the last reported quarter, 86% of revenue came from a single end customer. This intense customer concentration risk can impact revenues as the company becomes highly vulnerable to the loss of business from those clients. To diversify its base, CRDO added that it has two additional hyperscalers in qualification and has already achieved volume production with three others. The company expects to ramp up with these two hyperscalers in fiscal 2026.These factors, along with increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties, may impact CRDO’s growth trajectory. Credo competes with semiconductor giants like Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc . MRVL.Analysts also seem wary as reflected in unchanged revisions for earnings estimates in the past 60 days. CRDO Falls Steeper Than PeersCRDO’s 33.3% decline is also much steeper than peers like Broadcom and Cirrus Logic, Inc . CRUS. Broadcom and Cirrus Logic have declined 11.6% and 6.5%, respectively. However, Marvell’s stock has declined 48.9% in the same time frame. CRDO Trades at a PremiumCredo Technology stock is also not so cheap, as its Value Style Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 12.92, higher than the Electronic-Semiconductors sector’s multiple of 6.97.In comparison, Broadcom trades at a forward 12-month P/S multiple of 14.46, while Cirrus Logic and Marvell Technology are trading at a multiple of 2.76 and 5.71, respectively.Hold CRDO for NowWhile Credo appears well-positioned in the AI-driven connectivity space, there are several factors that could exert downward pressure on the stock. Key concerns include customer concentration, competitive pressures, stretched valuation, and overreliance on AI spending.CRDO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5a0015f9b094b:0-crdo-tanks-33-in-3-months-should-you-hold-the-stock-or-make-an-exit/

YELP shares gained 1% during Thursday’s extended trading session after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2025 results. The company’s first-quarter earnings jumped 80% to 36 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.1%.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Yelp Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Yelp Inc. QuoteYelp’s Q1 in DetailYelp’s advertising revenues (95.2% of total revenues) increased 8% year over year to $342 million, primarily driven by an increase in revenues from Yelp ad products and, to some extent, the addition of revenues from the RepairPal Network. The increase in Yelp ad product revenues was mainly driven by the year-over-year growth in average CPC, partially offset by a decrease in ad clicks. Our model estimate for Advertising revenues was pegged at $336 million.Advertising revenues from the Services business grew 14% year over year to $232 million, driven mainly by strong demand from advertisers and a rise in paying advertising locations. The RR&O division decreased 3% year over year to $110 million. This decline in the segment was due to persistent macroeconomic headwinds that have further challenged restaurant and retail businesses, reducing demand for Yelp’s services in the RR&O category. Other revenues increased 9% to $17 million.Our model estimates for Services, RR&O and Other revenues were pegged at $216.5 million, $119.6 million and $15.7 million, respectively.

Nvidia and 29 Other Stocks to Play AI — Barrons.com,1746732720000,"By Teresa RivasWhile tariffs have caused tech stocks to bend, they won't break, a longtime bull says. It's all thanks to artificial intelligence.The technology sector has been one of the harder-hit areas during the 2025 market downturn. Even as stocks have started to rebound amid hopes for tariff negotiations, the Nasdaq Composite is still down more than 8% year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's loss, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund is off some 13%.Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that tech's underdog status won't last. Perhaps most obviously, the artificial intelligence genie can't be put back in the bottle. AI is becoming increasingly mainstream, whether it's people talking to chatbots, retailers using it to personalize their promotional efforts, or companies hoping to improve efficiency and productivity.In short, the AI revolution will continue to play out for years to come. That's the stance of Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime tech bull. He calls AI the fourth industrial revolution in a new note Thursday, arguing that ""it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.""That creates an opportunity for multiple companies — and their investors — to win. He highlights 30 tech companies that he says will be long-term winners across six areas: hyperscalers, software, consumer internet, cybersecurity, autonomous and robotics, and semiconductors and hardware.Often thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" of AI, semiconductors and hardware makers are the second largest group in his list. They have also been some of the most well-known AI beneficiaries, including Nvidia — Ives calls co-founder Jensen Huang the ""godfather of AI.""Naturally Ives still likes the stock, along with Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. He says AMD will continue to strengthen its position and gain market share, and Taiwan Semi — the world's leading chip foundry — will make it a beneficiary of the global increase in AI investments. In addition, Micron has ""an enviable position within memory,"" while Broadcom, the world leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cloud and AI, will benefit from the buildout of these technologies.More than 15% of cloud services now include some AI component, making hyperscalers another area of huge investments. Major companies in the space ""are expected to spend $325 billion+ in 2025 through AI capital expenditures, representing 40% year-over-year growth and over $100 billion year-over-year increase as data center buildouts continue with the AI Arms Race only just beginning,"" Ives writes."" Microsoft is currently in the driver's seat,"" he says, adding that Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, and Oracle aren't far behind.With both people and businesses ramping up their use of AI, consumer internet companies stand to benefit, too, Ives says. Positives could include AI customer service, to improved search, personalization of ads, and dynamic pricing.His favorite picks stateside are Apple — he estimates about a quarter of the world's population will eventually access AI through an Apple device — and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is still seeing strong underlying demand. Among Chinese stocks, he highlights Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu. It's becoming ""clearer [Alibaba] could be one of the winners in the China AI Arms Race,"" he writes, while Baidu is another major Chinese player poised to do well.Robotics is another key area, as the ""global autonomous vehicle market size is expected to reach $3.22 trillion by 2033 representing a 36% compound annual growth rate,"" Ives writes. Tesla's robo-taxis earn it a spot here, while nuclear energy start-up Oklo will help meet the increasing power demands of automation.Of course, all of these advancements make cybersecurity more important than ever. Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and CyberArk Software are his picks here.Software is the largest category, as 1 billion apps will be with generative AI by 2028, Ive says, noting ""the software era of AI use cases [is] already under way."" Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, IBM, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Adobe, Pegasystems, MongoDB, C3.ai, Elastic, Innodata, and SoundHound are on his list of winners.Tariffs remain a worry, though Ives predicts they won't dent the AI revolution in the long run.He isn't the only optimist on this front. 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere writes Thursday that investors will likely return to megacap tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven because the U.S. economy will likely avoid a recession, though it might slow.""High-quality, monopolistic companies with strong earnings momentum are favorable in our base case of an economic muddle through, especially after large price drawdowns,"" he writes.Time to ask ChatGPT if tech is cheap enough to buy the dip.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Lam Research Set to Report Q3 Earnings: How to Play the Stock?,1745237340000,"Lam Research Corporation LRCX is scheduled to release its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on April 23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1 per share, calling for growth of 28.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The earnings figure has been revised a penny upward over the past 60 days. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects revenues of $4.65 billion (+/- $300 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.64 billion, indicating 22.3% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Lam Research has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, LRCX delivered an earnings surprise of 4.6%. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lam Research Corporation QuoteEarnings Whispers for LRCXOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lam Research this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.15%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LRCX carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Likely to Influence LRCX’s Quarterly PerformanceLam Research has been riding the wave of a strong rebound in the semiconductor industry, driven by the surging demand for memory and advanced AI applications. The rise in spending on AI and machine learning, particularly with the growing influence of Generative AI, is likely to have provided a significant boost to the company's performance in the fiscal third quarter. The increasing need for advanced AI-centric chips has become a key growth catalyst.Heightened dynamic random access memory (DRAM) spending, especially in response to demand for high-bandwidth memory, is likely to have played in Lam Research's favor. The company's momentum in 3D DRAM and advanced packaging technologies is also expected to have added to its strong performance. At the same time, ongoing technological advancements are pushing NAND spending higher, which is likely to contribute to Lam’s quarterly results.Lam Research’s focus on expanding semiconductor fabrication capabilities, along with its heavy investment in research and development, positions it well in a competitive landscape. Its innovation through Semiverse solutions, particularly in high-aspect-ratio memory hole etch for NAND, is likely to have fueled this progress. LRCX’s strategic investments in cutting-edge technologies are likely to have bolstered its performance in the foundry and logic segment, while the increasing adoption of 3D architectures is expected to have supported growth in its etch and deposition services.The company’s robust suite of tools, which enable foundry logic inflections, is likely to have secured strong customer traction. With the accelerating deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), Lam Research’s semiconductor and memory solutions remain in high demand, reinforcing its market position in the fiscal third quarter.All these factors are likely to have driven growth in system revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts fiscal third-quarter system revenues at $2.94 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 22.6%, underscoring Lam Research’s continued strength in the evolving tech landscape. The consensus mark for the Customer Support segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 22.7%.LRCX Stock Price Performance & ValuationLam Research shares have plunged 26.5% over the past year, underperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has risen 6.2%. The stock has also underperformed its industry peers, including Broadcom AVGO, QUALCOMM QCOM and Marvell Technology MRVL. Broadcom stock has soared 39.7% over the past year, while shares of QUALCOMM and Marvell Technology have plunged 14.7% and 17.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceLet us look at the value Lam Research offers investors at current levels. Currently, LRCX is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 16.94X compared with the industry’s 21.71X. Compared with industry peers, the stock trades at lower multiples than Broadcom and Marvell Technology, while at higher multiple than QUALCOMM. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and QUALCOMM have forward 12-month P/E multiples of 23.8X, 17.68X and 11.15X, respectively.Forward 12-Month P/E RatioInvestment Thesis for Lam Research StockLam Research has long been a pillar of the chip equipment world, especially in etch and deposition technology, which are critical for producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging technologies essential for AI workloads. These leading-edge technologies are helping it capitalize on the opportunities from the booming demand for AI and datacenter chips, which require advanced fabrication technologies.In 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion by 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents further growth opportunities for Lam Research’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.Nonetheless, Lam Research is not immune to risks. U.S.-China trade tensions pose a significant challenge. China accounted for 31% of its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues, down from 37% in the prior quarter. During the last reported quarter earnings call, the company revealed that $700 million in expected sales from restricted Chinese customers will not materialize in 2025, creating a noticeable sales gap.Additionally, declining demand for mature-node semiconductor equipment is weighing on Lam Research’s foundry business. Foundry revenues fell from 41% of system sales in the first quarter to 35% in the second quarter, reflecting weaker demand. With TSMC and other foundries slowing their mature-node spending, Lam Research’s growth in this segment could remain sluggish.Conclusion: Hold Lam Research for NowWhile geopolitical risks and mature-node weakness could create short-term headwinds, Lam Research’s discounted valuation, solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling long-term hold. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7990c75bd094b:0-lam-research-set-to-report-q3-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/
Chips Stocks Rise as U.S. Plans to Overhaul Curbs on AI Chip Exports,1746716580000,"By Kelly CloonanChip stocks rose across the board as the Trump administration plans to overhaul export regulations on U.S. chip companies.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.8% to $104.20 on Thursday. Intel rose 2.3%, while Qualcomm and Broadcom both ticked up around 1%. Nvidia shares remained flat.The Commerce Department plans to replace a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips countries like India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel can buy, a spokeswoman said.The rule, commonly known as AI diffusion, had been set to go into effect May 15. It aimed to prevent other countries from routing U.S. chips to adversaries like China, but was seen as controversial across the tech industry. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle argued it would harm American companies' business prospects abroad without doing much to hinder China.Other regulations appear to remain for now, though. The Trump administration recently issued new export-licensing requirements covering Nvidia's H20 chips, which the company said would result in a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings. AMD's MI308 processors also are affected, with the company expecting charges of $800 million.Write to Kelly Cloonan at kelly.cloonan@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010812:0-chips-stocks-rise-as-u-s-plans-to-overhaul-curbs-on-ai-chip-exports/

Nvidia Stock Wavers as Trump Plans to Scrap Biden's Chip-Export Rules — Barrons.com,1746716340000,"Adam ClarkNvidia and other semiconductor stocks were rising Thursday as the Trump administration said it plans to scrap regulations that would limit exports of artificial-intelligence chips worldwide.Nvidia shares were down 0.3% at $116.71 in Thursday morning trading, after gaining more than 3% the previous day. Advanced Micro Devices stock was gaining 2.6%, and Broadcom stock was rising 0.4%.Chip makers were rising after the Commerce Department said Wednesday afternoon that it doesn't intend to implement AI processor restrictions drawn up under the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported . The curbs were set to go into effect on May 15 and would have limited sales more widely than existing sanctions on exports to China.The so-called ""AI diffusion"" rules were expected to reduce the long-term market for AI chips by as much as 10%, according to analysts at BofA Securities.""We welcome the administration's leadership and new direction on AI policy. With the AI Diffusion Rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, "" Nvidia said in an emailed statement.However, it isn't clear if the overhaul will lead to alternative rules on chip exports, which could potentially be even more onerous. The White House has considered including AI-processor limits as part of bilateral agreements with individual countries, according to the report.More information could come with President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Middle East next week, where AI chip exports are likely to be on the agenda.""We generally expect that Trump will increase the total of chips allowed to be sold globally, starting with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but this could also come with more enforcement to prevent the diversion of banned chips to China,"" wrote Raymond James analyst Ed Mills in a research note.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AMD, Micron, Broadcom Stocks Fall. The Chip Fallout Continues. — Barrons.com",1744899960000,"Elsa OhlenAdvanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and Micron Technology dropped Thursday after suffering another blow from President Donald Trump's trade policy, and despite analysts lowering estimates due to restrictions on artificial-intelligence chips to China.AMD stock traded down 0.5% to $87.81 after the opening bell on Thursday. That follows a 7.4% drop on Wednesday after news broke that U.S. exports of certain AI chips would now be subject to new licensing requirements.While not an outright ban, it appears no licenses have been granted.Broadcom stock fell 0.9% to $172.96, and Micron stock dropped 2.6% to $67.56. Qualcomm shares rose 0.3% to $136.14, while Nvidia stock slid 2.9% to $101.44.This week, the first shots were fired in the trade war in the tech world, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote Thursday. ""This is just the beginning of what is going to be a long and drawn-out process between the U.S. and China with 145% reciprocal tariffs now in place and the Street/market now waiting for any signs or tea leaves of some negotiations to kick off, "" he said.""Nvidia and U.S. Big Tech [are] caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.""Products in the export restrictions would include AMD's MI308, Nvidia's H20, as well as any other chips with similar memory or bandwidth.AMD said it expects to apply for licenses, but there are no assurances they'll be granted. The company also predicted an $800 million hit for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.""Clearly, we may need to wait for the Trump administration to finish its tariff and regulatory exploits before shares of Nvidia (and any semis company with sales into China) can get relief,"" Melius analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote.

Top U.S. Firms May Set the Course for Productivity,1746715260000,"By Matt GrossmanNew analysis suggests that cutting-edge tech giants and other standout companies have pushed the economy forward more than previously understood.In a new paper, researchers at McKinsey found that a relatively small handful of top businesses have done far more to accelerate workplace productivity than the vast sea of their competitors.Productivity measures how much workers accomplish, on average, during a standard shift: an important variable in determining whether the economy can thrive and grow without generating inflation.Many economists have figured that America's solid productivity improvements in the past decade grew out of a massive agglomeration of tiny tweaks at millions of businesses. In fact, what happens inside some of the U.S.'s megacaps likely weighs quite a bit heavier, according to McKinsey.Researchers at the consulting firm's internal research arm studied how much each of a set of more than 8,000 firms in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany added to the overall group's productivity between 2011 and 2019. They found in a report published Wednesday that in the U.S., just 5% of companies contributed 78% of the productivity growth that the entire U.S. group achieved over those eight years.As might be expected, tech giants including Amazon.com, Nvidia and Broadcom were prominent among the outperformers. In other industries, superstar retailers such as Home Depot have moved the ball forward, as have, perhaps more surprisingly, big air carriers such as United Airlines, McKinsey thinks.By the research team's thinking, each of these productivity superstars harnessed breakaway capabilities to transform the way its workers get things done. Home Depot's logistics, pricing and IT infrastructure, for example, have allowed its retail workers to produce far more value on the job than cashiers at mom-and-pop hardware stores ever could.That's not to say broader factors don't also play a part. The American culture of enterprise and the U.S.'s relatively permissive rules for businesses foster an environment that makes those innovations possible, said Olivia White, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, which produced the report.""It's very much going to be the fruit of both the regulatory environment in the country and also the ecosystem among the companies,"" White said. ""The way the whole system works really, really matters.""Data published Thursday by the Labor Department showed that productivity fell by 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, after rising by 1.7% in 2024's fourth quarter. It was the first quarterly decline in productivity in almost three years.Because explaining productivity is so subtle, many economists don't pay that much attention to changes from quarter to quarter. Over 2023 and 2024, U.S. productivity growth averaged about 2.6% per year, well above other big economies' track record.During those years, American productivity outperformance fueled a remarkable stretch of resilient growth coupled with falling inflation, a pairing that lifted the U.S. as a magnet for global investment. Yet there's been no deep consensus among economists on what set the U.S. apart.Competing explanations have included an intensive shortage of workers that hit during the postpandemic boom, which forced companies to deploy limited staff more productively. Others have argued that a large cohort of newly created businesses gave rise to thousands of new sandboxes where bosses could rethink how work gets done.McKinsey's research casts some doubt on those ideas. During the 2010s at least, McKinsey's new work suggests, U.S. productivity growth had a lot more to do with seismic changes that originated from a small posse of standouts.The firm also cites bold moves such as how Broadcom shifted its strategy to focus on infrastructure software, rather than just semiconductors, as turning points in the U.S. productivity story. Similarly, workers who played a part in Apple's smartphone business were helping to develop a genuinely life-changing and remarkably profitable product.Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010576:0-top-u-s-firms-may-set-the-course-for-productivity/
Broadcom’s Apple Relationship: AI Opportunity Meets Tariff Risk,1744899960000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] As one of the largest companies in the world,  semiconductor stock Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO naturally has relationships with some of the other most prominent firms on the globe. Due to the market fixation on  AI , many have become aware of Broadcom’s relationship with Google's parent company, Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG . Alphabet developed its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) with Broadcom’s chip technology, which it uses to train its AI models.However, outside of AI, Broadcom also has a historical relationship with the largest public company in the world, Apple NASDAQ:AAPL . Apple uses Broadcom chips in its wireless consumer devices. This relationship may take on a new form, as Broadcom has reportedly been working with Apple to develop AI chips.The analysis below will dive into Broadcom’s relationship with Apple . Just how significant is Broadcom’s non-AI Apple business? How exposed could Broadcom be to tariff-related risks within this business line? Additionally, is Apple actually trying to build AI chips with Broadcom technology, and what type of upside could this mean for Broadcom if so?Apple: Broadcom’s Wireless StalwartBroadcom’s non-AI relationship with Apple is big . Before fiscal Q1 2025, Broadcom categorized its semiconductor revenues as follows: networking, wireless, server storage, broadband, and industrial. In Q4 2024, the company brought in approximately $2.2 billion in wireless revenue. Almost all of this likely came from Apple.Press releases clearly show that Broadcom makes chips used in Apple products. This includes things like WiFi cards and 5G radio frequency components. In its Q2 2024 earnings call, Broadcom referenced a North American wireless customer, saying that it “represents all of our wireless business.” Reading between the lines, they are clearly talking about Apple. Overall, this $2.2 billion in wireless revenue represented nearly 16% of Broadcom’s total $14 billion in revenue that quarter.Clearly, Apple is a huge part of Broadcom’s business . So, how could tariffs impact Broadcom’s business due to its relationship with Apple?Recent Tariff Changes Provide a Reprieve for Apple and BroadcomMarkets were highly concerned about Apple after the tariff back-and-forth between the United States and China. Apple has Chinese companies assemble around 90% of its iPhones. President Trump's  145% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports would force Apple to raise iPhone prices, which could greatly hurt sales volume. This would have been bad news for Broadcom, as fewer iPhone sales mean fewer chip sales.It looks like Apple and Broadcom can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. The United States Customs and Border Protection recently announced that electronics will be exempt from these reciprocal tariffs. However, these companies are far from out of the woods. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on electronics are still coming.The government will do this using sector-specific duties on semiconductors. Lutnick stated that the government could enact these in one to two months.Overall, it's difficult to say anything concrete with tariff policies changing daily. However, for Broadcom, these tariffs that could soon affect Apple products are destructive. They will hurt the firm’s non-AI chip business, possibly in a big way. It is important to note that Broadcom’s wireless business really wasn’t growing much anyway. Growth in this segment has ranged from slightly positive to slightly negative over many of the past quarters. Despite this, Broadcom has continued to succeed, indicating the company may not be massively hurt by lower Apple device demand.Broadcom and Apple's AI Ambitions and Potential Partnership [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] In early December 2024, reports emerged that Apple was working with Broadcom to build its own AI chip. Apple wants to use the product in AI servers to enhance the capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Although Apple and Broadcom have not verified this relationship, some clues suggest that this could be true. Apple’s $500 billion investment in the United States will go largely toward making AI servers.Within this announcement, Apple said the servers will use “Apple silicon,"" indicating that Apple is designing custom chips. Tech firms like Alphabet have previously found a key partner in Broadcom in designing custom chips. Thus, it seems very possible that Apple and Broadcom are pairing up on this venture to do the same.This could significantly boost Broadcom’s revenues. Apple is the world’s most valuable public company, but many have seen the firm as a laggard when it comes to adopting AI. Broadcom would be happy to help them catch up.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:a77b9b2a9094b:0-broadcom-s-apple-relationship-ai-opportunity-meets-tariff-risk/

Nvidia Stock Leaps on Report Trump Will Relax AI Chip Export Curbs — Barrons.com,1746648660000,"Adam Clark and Liz MoyerNvidia stock jumped late in Wednesday's trading session after a report the Trump administration could relax export curbs on artificial intelligence chips.Shares of Nvidia closed up 3.1%. Other chip stocks also rallied after a Bloomberg report said President Donald Trump would overturn AI chip export curbs put into place by the Biden administration that were set to go into effect.Earnings from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer indicated healthy demand for artificial-intelligence chips, but they also highlighted risks from export restrictions and the transition to new infrastructure.Positive signs came from rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, which reported better-than-expected earnings, and gave sales guidance ahead of expectations in a report on Tuesday. Shares of AMD rose 1.8% on Wednesday.AMD warned that U.S. export controls on semiconductors would cost the company $1.5 billion in revenue this year, in a reminder of the threat hanging over the chip industry.Nvidia has already disclosed that its first-quarter results will include a $5.5 billion charge associated with inventory and purchase commitments related to the H20 chip for the Chinese market, following the imposition of licensing requirements. Analysts at Jefferies have suggested that will translate to around a $10 billion hit to revenue.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated the market in China for AI chips will be $50 billion in a few years, and warned that restriction on semiconductors exports wouldn't limit Chinese military capacity, in comments late on Tuesday to attendees of the Milken Institute annual meeting.Elsewhere, AI-server maker Super Micro reported earnings and revenue at the top end of its guided range on Tuesday, but provided disappointing guidance for the current quarter, noting some customers were delaying decisions.

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Marvell Stock Falls Sharply. What's Hurting the Former AI Chip Favorite. — Barrons.com,1746627960000,"By Adam ClarkMarvell Technology was falling sharply Wednesday after the company postponed its investor day in the face of market uncertainty.It's another blow for a stock which has lost its status as a favored play on the artificial-intelligence trend.The designer of data-storage and networking chips said it had decided to postpone its previously scheduled investor-day event from June 10 to an unspecified future date in 2026, citing ""the dynamic macroeconomic environment,"" in a statement late on Tuesday.At the same time, Marvell reaffirmed the midpoint of first-quarter revenue guidance and narrowed its range. It expects revenue of about $1.875 billion, with a range of plus or minus 2%.The stock was down 8.9% at $55.75 on Wednesday. That's set to add to a 45% drop this year so far through Tuesday's close, which has wiped out all of Marvell's gains from 2024.Marvell became a market darling last year alongside peer Broadcom as investors bet that its clients — which analysts believe include Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft — would spend heavily on the company's custom chip designs as they sought alternatives to Nvidia hardware.However, poorly received guidance alongside quarterly earnings in March sunk the stock as investors soured on AI plays amid tariff uncertainty. Marvell has also been hit by concerns that it might lose out on designing the next generation of Amazon's custom Trainium AI chips.""The postponed investor day will only add to the wall of worry that has developed around the name, particularly around Marvell's ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] opportunity following reports that Taiwanese competitor Alchip has won Amazon's next-generation Trainium 3 project,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji in a research note.Marvell did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.However Naji still sees opportunity in the shares, reiterating an Outperform rating on Marvell stock. He noted the company now trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 times his forecast for its 2025 earnings and 18 times its forecast 2026 earnings — a far cry from the forward earnings multiple of more than 40 times it carried late last year.""While at these levels the stock is not expensive, we worry that the shares may be range-bound until investor confidence in Marvell's custom chip pipeline improves,"" Naji wrote.Investors might hope for some reassurance at a June 17 webinar focused on the future of custom silicon technology for AI infrastructure, which Marvell said it would hold.""While we are encouraged that the company still plans to address its custom silicon opportunity, where the firm noted 'great progress,' we also read into the indefinite rescheduling of its investor day as a likely negative indicator for the firm's near-term upcoming July quarter outlook,"" wrote Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree in a research note.Acree lowered his estimates for Marvell's revenue for its fiscal 2026 year — ending Jan. 31 2026 — to $8.11 billion from $8.19 billion previously and his full-year earnings per share forecast to $2.74 from $2.80.The Benchmark analyst lowered his target price to $95 from $135. However, he kept a Buy rating on the stock and recommended investors take advantage of the weak share price.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

Broadcom Stock Gets a Lift on Hyperscaler Earnings & CapEx Boost,1746618300000,"Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ:AVGO continues to be a central player in the AI infrastructure build-out, and recent developments across the tech landscape may strengthen its growth outlook. Despite lingering market concerns about the pace and durability of AI-related spending, recent earnings season delivered a series of encouraging signals. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Several major technology firms reported strong momentum in their AI businesses, along with plans to maintain or increase capital expenditures tied to AI infrastructure.These announcements matter for Broadcom. As a supplier of high-performance networking components and custom silicon that help power large-scale AI deployments, Broadcom’s fortunes are tightly linked to the investment cycles of its largest customers.And while questions around competitive pressures and spending slowdowns have weighed on sentiment in recent months, investor response suggests a shift in tone: since the first of these earnings reports was released on April 24, Broadcom shares have climbed 7% through the May 6 close .The rebound reflects growing confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track—and that Broadcom remains well-positioned to benefit.AI Strength at Google & Meta Signal AI Strength for BroadcomTwo companies known as hyperscale customers of Broadcom are Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOGL , Google's parent company, and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META . Both companies posted strong results, largely due to the AI-centric parts of their business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud segment saw strong revenue growth of 28%. AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions were key drivers of this increase. The company also confirmed its CapEx spending forecast . It plans to allocate $75 billion , much of which will go to AI infrastructure through calendar 2025. The company also said that, like Q4 2024, Cloud demand exceeded capacity this quarter, another sign that CapEx spending isn’t tailing off.Meta also posted better-than-expected results . Its revenue grew at a solid 16% clip, and the price paid per ad increased by 10%. This indicates that the value of advertising on Meta’s apps continues to increase, likely driven by the AI investment the company is making. Meta also provided several examples showing that its AI investments are driving more engagement in its apps. Adding to the optimism around the AI story is the fact that the company actually increased its CapEx guidance for 2025 by 9%. The firm now expects to spend $68 billion at the midpoint.Both of these results are good signs for Broadcom . They show that these AI hyperscale customers are seeing their investment in the technology lead to tangible results. Amid concerns that AI spending could slow down due to the DeepSeek revelations, these companies are in no way signaling that this is actually the case. This is key for Broadcom , considering that big reductions in AI infrastructure spending would be very bad news for the stock. The fact that Broadcom shares sold off over 17% in just one day after the DeepSeek news broke evidences this. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:AVGO] Microsoft’s CapEx to Keep Growing: Could It Be Broadcom’s Next Customer?Microsoft’s NASDAQ:MSFT results also boost Broadcom's confidence , but in a somewhat different way. Microsoft reported a 33% increase in revenue from its Azure cloud business. AI is becoming a larger part of Azure’s growth. Three quarters ago, AI accounted for less than a quarter of the growth in Azure. That percentage has risen every quarter since. In the latest results,  almost half of Azure's growth came from AI . [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Additionally, Microsoft reaffirmed its CapEx spending through the fiscal year ending in June at $80 billion. For the company’s next fiscal year, it has yet to release exact CapEx forecasts . However, the figure will be more than $80 billion. On the earnings call, the company said that compared to fiscal 2025 levels, “ we expect CapEx to grow. ” However, it did mention that the growth rate in CapEx would slow.Microsoft isn't a confirmed customer of Broadcom's AI chips. Still, rising AI demand and growth CapEx support Broadcom's investment case . It shows that investments in AI, which are a huge driver of revenue growth for Broadcom , are paying off. This means that hyperscalers are likely to keep spending on AI, providing a robust source of revenue for Broadcom. Aside from its current hyperscale customers, Broadcom is also in talks to develop custom AI chips for four other hyperscalers. At some point, news could break that Microsoft is one of these firms.Amazon Adds to Optimism, Broadcom’s AI Demand Can Keep HummingFurther good news came from another hyperscaler, Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN . The company noted its AI business is growing at triple digits from the previous year and referenced that demand still exceeds capacity.The company didn’t change its CapEx guidance from $100 billion for calendar 2025. Amazon is not a Broadcom customer, but the reasons for optimism are similar to those related to Microsoft.The AI-related news coming from these hyperscalers provides strong reassurance about Broadcom's growth story . Seeing the AI train continue to chug along for some time is key to the success of Broadcom's stock. Looking forward, it appears the engine will continue to see more coal shoveled into its firebox.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:79fc3da9d094b:0-broadcom-stock-gets-a-lift-on-hyperscaler-earnings-capex-boost/
Nvidia Stock Rises. Why This Analyst's Shrugging Off China Chip Restrictions Impact. — Barrons.com,1747923060000,"By George GloverNvidia stock was rising on Thursday, with just a handful of sessions left until the chip maker reports earnings that should underline appetite for artificial intelligence demand.Shares rose 1% to $133.15 in early trading. The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.2%.Nvidia is set to report its first-quarter earnings after next Wednesday's closing bell. The company's results have become a must-see event in recent years, with sales of its graphics processing units tending to be a good barometer of broader AI demand.Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a research note published late Wednesday that he was expecting ""upside results and a roughly in-line July-quarter outlook, despite the loss of the loss of H20 sales to China following U.S. government restrictions."" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has slammed Washington's chip curbs, designed to stop Beijing from getting its hands on the company's advanced AI chips, this week.Schafer said the stock remained ""best-positioned in AI."" He rates shares at Outperform, with a $175 price target that implies they have upside of 33%.Other chip maker stocks were also rising on Thursday.

Pre-Markets Open in The Red ,1744815240000,"Economic & Earnings CommentaryPre-market futures are still in the red at this hour, but threaten to break out into positive territory compared with where we were overnight. We’re also bifurcated presently: -40 points, roughly, on both the Dow and S&P 500, but -260 points on he tech-heavy Nasdaq.A report that NVIDIA NVDA will take a $5.5 charge on its H20 AI chips that were believed to be headed to China. The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has snuffed this out — news reports refer to this as being “curbed” — and sent NVIDIA shares down -6% in pre-market trading. AMD AMD is doing even worse, Broadcom AVGO a bit better — but still all down.Retail Sales Improve for March: Evidence of “Pull-Forward”?We remain at the mercy of trade tariff policy for the foreseeable future, and this goes for plenty of economic reports for last month, as well. To wit, U.S. Retail Sales for March reached +1.4% on headline, 20 basis points (bps) ahead of expectations. Ex-autos, +0.5% is a strong showing, even if it is still -20 bps below the big upward revision to February’s number.Ex-autos and gas swung up to +0.8% last month, equalling the upward revision for the previous month (which itself was ratcheted up 30 bps) and the strongest month since September 2024’s +1.2%. The Control number, which feeds other economic data like PCE (which comes out at the end of this month), was a bit weaker, relatively: +0.4%, from the upwardly revised +1.3% for February.At a glance, these figures all seem to be U.S. companies getting ahead of the tariffs, which began two weeks ago today, April 2nd. Remain unconvinced? Check auto parts deliveries last month, which rose +5.3%. This resembles more a year-over-year number than a month-over-month one. Perhaps we’ll need to compare these figures to the coming months, but it stands to reason we see a “pull-forward” in this data.Q1 Earnings Roundup: TRV, ABT, USB & MoreQ1 earnings season continues to heat up. Major insurance provider and Dow component The Travelers TRV posted a strong beat in its Q1 earnings ahead of the opening bell: $1.91 per share was nearly +200% stronger than the 64 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $11.87 billion, however, came in -2.17% from estimates. Shares are up +2.5% on the news, adding to the stock’s +3.6% year to date.Abbott Laboratories ABT beat on its Q1 earnings by 2 cents to $1.09 per share, while missing slightly on its top line: $10.36 billion versus $10.42 billion expected. Better performance in its Pharma and Nutrition space were offset somewhat by lower numbers from its Diagnostics segment. Shares are down marginally, but still up more than +10% year to date.U.S. Bank USB keeps the train of big banks reporting earnings this week, notching slight beats on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.03 per share on $6.96 billion in revenues outpaced expectations by +4% and +0.6%, respectively. Shares are up +1.4% in today’s pre-market, but still have a long climb back from -17% year to date.Swedish auto parts provider Autoliv ALV posted strong beats for both earnings and revenues in its Q1 report this morning, beating on earnings per share by +25% and +4.25% on quarterly sales. Again, we sense some “beat the tariffs” trading going on with these figures, but shares are up +8% ahead of the regular session, making up a good chunk of its -12% level year to date.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a4890eef9094b:0-pre-markets-open-in-the-red/

These 4 Top Investors Bought Over 6 Million Broadcom Shares in Q1,1747922400000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO is one of just 10 stocks globally with a market cap over $1 trillion as of May 21. This makes it one of the most closely watched stocks in the market. Retail investors and famous money managers have come to know this company well. It has played a key role in the AI infrastructure buildout, which has been driving the market higher for some time.Many big investors bought Broadcom in large amounts in Q1. This became clear when they released their 13F filings . That makes a good deal of sense, considering that Broadcom shares fell by more than 27% in Q1. The analysis below will detail some of the highest-profile investors who bought Broadcom in spades. It is important to note that the data on these purchases only extends to March 31. Thus, these investors could have sold or bought more Broadcom shares since. Still, knowing how investors felt about Broadcom and similar companies in Q1 can help retail investors understand how to view the stock going forward.AI Bubble Bear Grantham Owned Nearly 14x More AVGO Than NVIDIA in Q1A huge purchaser of Broadcom in Q1 was investor Jeremy Grantham. Grantham co-founded Grantham, May and Van Otterloo (GMO) and is the company’s long-term investment strategist. Grantham is often considered a contrarian investor, pushing back against overzealous market trends. Many consider him to have predicted the dot-com bubble around two years before it popped. Despite Grantham’s claims that AI investing is a bubble, Grantham’s GMO bought over 1.5 million shares of Broadcom in Q1. Additionally, many of the firm's biggest holdings are among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have invested tens of billions in AI infrastructure.Still, the big decline in Broadcom shares in Q1 could back up Grantham’s claims that the AI bubble would deflate. As of the May 21 close, Broadcom is trading only around 6% below its 2025 high. Assuming the stock stays near this level through the end of Q2, seeing GMO greatly reduce its Broadcom holdings in its Q2 13F would be a logical next step. This would indicate he actually sees Broadcom as part of the AI bubble and simply took advantage of it temporarily deflating in Q1. Interestingly, Grantham has just a $21 million position in NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , versus $291 million in Broadcom. Sure, NVIDIA only fell 19% in Q1, but this positioning indicates Grantham sees Broadcom as a relatively better value .Renaissance, Two Sigma, and Dalio Buy Over 5 Million Broadcom Shares CombinedAnother massive high-profile Broadcom buyer in Q1 was Renaissance Technologies , an investment firm many regard as the most successful hedge fund of all time. Renaissance purchased over 2.4 million shares of Broadcom in Q1, massively increasing the firm’s stake in the company. Renaissance is notoriously tight-lipped about its thoughts on the market, making it difficult to assert its thinking. However, depending on the data points looked at, one could argue that Renaissance may or may not still see value in Broadcom shares. [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Two Sigma Advisors and Bridgewater Associates are other notable investment companies that bought significant shares of Broadcom in Q1. They bought around 2.5 million and 280,000 shares, respectively. Two Sigma has become known as one of the pioneers of quantitative investing, relying largely on complex math and non-traditional data to invest. For many, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio needs no introduction. He is a prolific author, investing thought leader, and has built what was, at one time, the largest hedge fund in the world.At the end of Q1, Two Sigma held 3.9 million shares of Broadcom. The company hasn’t had even close to this big of a position since Q3 2024, when it held 3.6 million shares. Notably, Broadcom’s average closing price during that period was just $159. In Q1, that figure was $211. The company held more shares in Q1, when the average closing price was about 33% higher. This suggests it thinks Broadcom's intrinsic value has increased very significantly. However, whether it sees value in prices near $230 or higher is more questionable.Broadcom’s Big Gain in Q2 Could Reveal These Investors' True ThoughtsSince Broadcom’s shares now only trade marginally lower than their 2025 peak , these investors' next 13F filings could reveal at what price they are comfortable holding shares.If Broadcom remains near the $230 mark through the rest of Q2, continuing to hold their shares could indicate these investors see potential for the stock to test all-time highs near $250.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f0037420b094b:0-these-4-top-investors-bought-over-6-million-broadcom-shares-in-q1/

TSM Stock Soars 20% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1746558000000,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM has seen its share price soar 19.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 16.2% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit, or continue holding the stock?What Drove TSM Stock Higher?Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s recent rally stemmed from broader market optimism. Whispers of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations significantly boosted market sentiment in late April. Protracted trade tensions had previously dampened global economic forecasts and corporate earnings expectations due to tariffs and retaliatory measures.Hints of a potential deal suggested easing tensions, possible tariff reductions and smoother international trade flows. This improved outlook fostered investor confidence, leading to a rally in the equity market as fears of further economic disruption subsided and prospects for global growth seemed brighter.Semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Broadcom, Inc. AVGO, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, were the prime gainers from this rally as they had witnessed a tremendous selloff previously following the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. Over the past month, shares of Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA soared 30.5%, 21.2% and 16.3%, respectively.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI Boom Boosts TSM’s ProspectsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continues to dominate the semiconductor foundry space with its technological superiority and production scale. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has placed Taiwan Semiconductor at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle.The company has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players like NVIDIA, Marvell Technology and Broadcom.In 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, making up a mid-teen percentage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s total revenues, and the momentum is far from over. The company expects AI-related sales to double again in 2025, with an impressive 40% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. This positions TSM as the undisputed backbone of AI-driven technological advancements.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has started 2025 on a strong note by reporting overwhelming first-quarter results, wherein revenues surged 35% year over year to $25.53 billion, while net income jumped 53% to nearly $11 billion. This growth was driven by explosive demand for its 3nm and 5nm nodes, which together contributed nearly 58% of total wafer revenues.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s first-quarter EPS also jumped 53.6% to $2.12 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. The stock beat the consensus mark for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. QuoteTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is not only growing but also scaling at an unprecedented pace to capitalize on the AI-driven growing demand for advanced chips. The company is set to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, far outpacing its $29.8 billion investment in 2024. The bulk of this spending, around 70%, is focused on advanced manufacturing processes, ensuring TSM stays ahead of the curve.TSM Stock Trades at Attractive ValuationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.51, below the sector average of 23.84. This reasonable valuation, coupled with the company’s growth potential, offers an appealing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing also trades at a lower P/E ratio than other semiconductor players, including Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA trade at P/E ratios of 27.74, 20.95 and 24.8, respectively.Near-Term Risks Persist for TSMDespite its strengths, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing faces near-term headwinds. Higher energy prices in Taiwan, following a 25% electricity hike in 2024, pose a considerable challenge, especially as advanced nodes demand greater power.Softness in key markets like PCs and smartphones also dampens near-term prospects. These traditionally strong revenue drivers are projected to see only low single-digit growth in 2025, limiting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s growth despite rising AI demand.Additionally, rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are other concerns. These new facilities, while strategically important for diversification, are expected to dilute gross margins by 2-3% annually over the next three to five years due to higher labor and utility costs, coupled with lower initial utilization rates.Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, further cloud the outlook. With significant revenue exposure to China, export restrictions and supply-chain disruptions could pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s operations.Conclusion: Hold TSM Stock for NowTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s technological leadership and strategic investments make it a compelling long-term player in the semiconductor space. However, short-term challenges, including rising costs, tariff wars and geopolitical risks, warrant caution. For now, holding TSM stock remains the most prudent strategy, allowing investors to benefit from its industry leadership while navigating near-term uncertainties.Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C) This follows March showcase of 200G/lane DSP and SerDes, 400G optics, and PCIe Gen6 over optics products at the 2025 Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC). Strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

This zero-day options craze could finally be coming to popular stocks like Nvidia and Tesla. Here's what to know.,1746543180000,"By Joseph AdinolfiNasdaq has asked the SEC for permission to list options tied to a handful of popular stocks that would expire on Mondays and WednesdaysAn earlier version of this story incorrectly named Scott Bauer's firm.A surge in trading of so-called ""zero days to expiry"" - or ""0DTE"" - options has contributed to an options-market boom over the past few years, drawing in both sophisticated investors and amateur speculators.During the trading week, investors have been limited to trading 0DTE contracts tied to stock-market indexes like the S&P 500 and a handful of popular ETFs, including the Invesco QQQ Trust.But after a long wait, they could soon be coming for popular stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)In a filing published late last week, Nasdaq Inc. officially asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to expand offerings of option contracts tied to a handful of individual stocks. If the SEC signs off, the exchange would be allowed to list options tied to a select group of stocks that expire on Mondays and Wednesdays, giving traders two more opportunities per week to trade option contracts on the edge of expiration.""It's probably been a long time in the making,"" Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy and a former floor trader on a major options exchange, told MarketWatch.Currently, options tied to individual common stocks only expire on Fridays, while contracts tied to some stock-market indexes and highly liquid ETFs have more frequent expirations.Although a Nasdaq executive declined to comment on the exchange's plans, traders and industry experts who spoke with MarketWatch said that, if all goes well, contracts expiring on Tuesdays and Thursdays could soon follow.""They're not pure 0DTEs in the sense that they're not listed every day, but it's getting pretty close,"" Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics, told MarketWatch.See: 2024 was another record-breaking year for options trading. What's on tap for the industry in 2025.What is a '0DTE' option?Any option due to expire at the end of a session is considered a 0DTE contract. Technically, every option becomes a 0DTE on the last day of its life.Traders who spoke with MarketWatch have said the appeal of these contracts lies in the small chance of an outsize gain. If the market pushes them into the money before they expire, it could lead to a large windfall for a trader who had bought them minutes or hours earlier.Back in 2022, popular exchange operators like Cboe Global Markets expanded offerings tied to the S&P 500 and a few popular ETFs to allow traders to trade 0DTE contracts every day of the trading week. The change helped accelerate a boom in options trading that had begun shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic.The average daily trading volume in these extremely short-dated contracts has been climbing steadily since. 0DTE volumes in S&P 500 index options hit a record during the first quarter of 2025, according to Cboe data.A Cboe analyst estimated that roughly 50% to 60% of the average daily activity in S&P 500 0DTE contracts involves amateur individual investors, although the exact share is difficult to determine precisely.Their rise has coincided with a surge in activity across the broader U.S. equity-options market. According to the Options Clearing Corporation, the industry's main clearinghouse, more than 12 billion contracts changed hands in 2024, setting a record for the fifth year in a row.It appears another record could follow in 2025, with the industry already on track to top 14 billion contracts traded, according to Henry Schwartz, vice president of market intelligence at Cboe.'We're working closely with everybody'The SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny Nasdaq's request once the filing is published in the Federal Register, which had not yet happened as of Tuesday morning. A representative for the SEC didn't return a request for comment from MarketWatch.Once approved, these options could start trading within days.Nasdaq's decision to request the change was the culmination of a lengthy process by exchanges, brokerage platforms, market makers and other options-industry players. The goal was to figure out the best way to introduce more short-dated contracts tied to shares of individual stocks in a manner that would minimize risks for the industry and its customers.Ultimately, the exchange decided that Monday and Wednesday contracts wouldn't be listed on any day when the underlying company is due to report quarterly earnings. This should help to limit the chances that volatile swings in stocks after the closing bell could complicate trade settlements, a Nasdaq representative said.""We're working closely with everybody to make sure we're doing this in a safe and responsible way,"" said Greg Ferrari, a senior vice president at Nasdaq within the market platforms division.The changes proposed by Nasdaq would only allow Monday and Wednesday expirations for a handful of stocks and one additional ETF. As of January 2025, only contracts tied to Nvidia, Tesla, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) would be eligible for the Monday and Wednesday listings, along with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF XLF.'Lottery tickets'Options-market activity has been trending toward shorter-dated contracts for years, said OptionMetrics' DeSimone.At the same time, the advent of free-to-trade electronic brokerages has helped inspire a new generation of amateur individual investors to try their hand at options trading.Making it easier to trade 0DTE tied to individual stocks could accelerate both of these trends, DeSimone said. While institutional players still dominate index options, individual traders are more active in the single-stock space, DeSimone said.DeSimone cautioned that anybody interested in trading these products should keep their risk profile in mind. Some in the industry have likened 0DTE contracts to ""lottery tickets"" that offer a small chance of a large payout, and a high likelihood that the contract will expire worthless.JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, parent of brokerage tastytrade, pushed back against this characterization, calling it hyperbolic. He said many investors trade 0DTE options as part of spread strategies involving more than one contract, allowing them to more precisely manage their risk. Nasdaq and others have said that 0DTEs can help large traders more tactically manage their risk.""I think people are excited for the opportunity, but again I think we'll need to do some more education regarding exercise and assignment risk,"" Kinahan said. ""We have to continue to educate as to what the risks of these are, especially after the close.""-Joseph AdinolfiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

CRDO vs. AVGO: Which AI-focused Semiconductor Stock is the Better Buy?,1747831440000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. CRDO and Broadcom Inc. AVGO are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions essential for AI-driven data centers.The data center market is undergoing rapid transformation as organizations accelerate their digital initiatives, including the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, along with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This surge in digital activity has resulted in explosive data growth, placing significant pressure on existing data center infrastructure. Consequently, there is a rising need for advanced data processing and storage solutions to support AI workloads. This trend presents strong growth opportunities for companies like Credo and Broadcom.So, now the question arises: Which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let’s dive into the pros and cons for each company.The Case for CRDOCredo is gaining a strong market presence in both Ethernet and Active Electrical Cables (AECs) solutions specialized for data centers. AEC products experienced triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by their increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.Credo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. CRDO’s PCIe and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo for significant future revenue growth.Momentum in the optical business, particularly Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. It recently unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Case for AVGOBroadcom is a diversified semiconductor company with a strong presence in AI chip development space. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. These hyperscalers are significantly ramping up investment in their next-generation frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators and AI data centers with larger clusters. AVGO noted that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Consequently, AVGO’s Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Apart from these three customers, AVGO is also working with four other hyperscalers to aid them in building their own customized AI accelerators.XPUs are necessary to train Generative AI (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. Its next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. AVGO is now planning to tape out the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.In the last reported quarter, semiconductor solutions revenues (55% of net revenues) totaled $8.2 billion, rising 11% year over year, driven by strong AI semiconductor revenues. AI-related revenues grew 77% year over year to $4.1 billion, which was a major driver of overall revenue growth. This growth was driven by higher shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers for AI applications.For second-quarter fiscal 2025, Broadcom expects revenues of $14.9 billion, while AI semiconductor revenues are projected to grow 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow 17% year over year to $8.4 billion.Price Performance and Valuation for CRDO & AVGOOver the past month, CRDO and AVGO have registered gains of 67.8% and 36.3%, respectively.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 15.50X, lower than AVGO’s 16.05X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO?Analysts have kept their earnings estimates unchanged for CRDO’s bottom line in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, for AVGO, there is a marginal upward estimate revision.CRDO or AVGO: Which is a Better Pick?Both CRDO and MRVL are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI driven data center market. CRDO at present flaunts a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Consequently, in terms of Zacks Rank, AVGO seems to be a better pick at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70a692c5f094b:0-crdo-vs-avgo-which-ai-focused-semiconductor-stock-is-the-better-buy/
"Retail Sales, Q1 Earnings Show Signs of ""Pull Forward""",1744813680000,"Wednesday, April 16, 2025Pre-market futures are still in the red at this hour, but threaten to break out into positive territory compared with where we were overnight. We’re also bifurcated presently: -40 points, roughly, on both the Dow and S&P 500, but -260 points on he tech-heavy Nasdaq.A report that NVIDIA NVDA will take a $5.5 charge on its H20 AI chips that were believed to be headed to China. The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has snuffed this out — news reports refer to this as being “curbed” — and sent NVIDIA shares down -6% in pre-market trading. AMD AMD is doing even worse, Broadcom AVGO a bit better — but still all down.Retail Sales Improve for March: Evidence of “Pull-Forward”?We remain at the mercy of trade tariff policy for the foreseeable future, and this goes for plenty of economic reports for last month, as well. To wit, U.S. Retail Sales for March reached +1.4% on headline, 20 basis points (bps) ahead of expectations. Ex-autos, +0.5% is a strong showing, even if it is still -20 bps below the big upward revision to February’s number.Ex-autos and gas swung up to +0.8% last month, equalling the upward revision for the previous month (which itself was ratcheted up 30 bps) and the strongest month since September 2024’s +1.2%. The Control number, which feeds other economic data like PCE (which comes out at the end of this month), was a bit weaker, relatively: +0.4%, from the upwardly revised +1.3% for February.At a glance, these figures all seem to be U.S. companies getting ahead of the tariffs, which began two weeks ago today, April 2nd. Remain unconvinced? Check auto parts deliveries last month, which rose +5.3%. This resembles more a year-over-year number than a month-over-month one. Perhaps we’ll need to compare these figures to the coming months, but it stands to reason we see a “pull-forward” in this data.Q1 Earnings Roundup: TRV, ABT, USB & MoreQ1 earnings season continues to heat up. Major insurance provider and Dow component The Travelers TRV posted a strong beat in its Q1 earnings ahead of the opening bell: $1.91 per share was nearly +200% stronger than the 64 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $11.87 billion, however, came in -2.17% from estimates. Shares are up +2.5% on the news, adding to the stock’s +3.6% year to date. For more on TRV’s earnings, click here.Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.Abbott Laboratories ABT beat on its Q1 earnings by 2 cents to $1.09 per share, while missing slightly on its top line: $10.36 billion versus $10.42 billion expected. Better performance in its Pharma and Nutrition space were offset somewhat by lower numbers from its Diagnostics segment. Shares are down marginally, but still up more than +10% year to date.U.S. Bank USB keeps the train of big banks reporting earnings this week, notching slight beats on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.03 per share on $6.96 billion in revenues outpaced expectations by +4% and +0.6%, respectively. Shares are up +1.4% in today’s pre-market, but still have a long climb back from -17% year to date. For more on USB’s earnings, click here.Swedish auto parts provider Autoliv ALV posted strong beats for both earnings and revenues in its Q1 report this morning, beating on earnings per share by +25% and +4.25% on quarterly sales. Again, we sense some “beat the tariffs” trading going on with these figures, but shares are up +8% ahead of the regular session, making up a good chunk of its -12% level year to date.

Bull of the Day: Credo Technology (CRDO),1746523200000,"Credo Technology Group (CRDO) is a key supplier of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the hyperscale datacenter, 5G carrier, enterprise networking, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI/ML markets.Credo is located in the center of the AI revolution in San Jose, CA.With sales growing 120% this fiscal year to $425 million, one of Credo's high demand products is their line of Active Electrical Cables (AEC) which provide high-speed connectivity solutions to data centers and enterprises with heavy AI and cloud computing needs.Credo also makes Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chipsets to facilitate high-bandwidth data transfer with low energy usage.Credo's largest and most strategic customers are leading hyper-scalers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon who use Credo's AECs to support AI and cloud infrastructure.And its biggest competition comes from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) in connectivity solutions for the AI Economy.NVIDIA is the AI Market MakerAs I've said for almost eight years, Jensen & Co. have been creating new industries we didn't even know we needed. Once modern data enterprises and research universities caught on to what GPU-CUDA ""massively parallel architectures"" could do for them, they literally created new uses cases by the thousands per year.When you can simulate anything, use synthetic data to do so, and then run billions of iterations on your experimental idea in a matter of hours, innovation happens much faster.Thus Jensen talks about 1,000-fold advances in science, engineering, and social challenges. And then you understand why NVIDIA (NVDA) power tools are in such demand for the Global 2000 corporations, plus universities, plus nation-states who need to secure and ""mine & model"" their own data.In my NVIDIA (NVDA) ""Top Picks"" video on April 21, I compared the new Huawei supercomputer offering to NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72.And one of my points of focus was on the high-speed, low-latency connectivity required for these new rack-scale architectures. I didn't mention Credo, but I'm very curious about how closely they are working together since Jensen likes that ""copper is cheaper"" and perfectly still useful for direct connections between GPUs in racks.A Fly in the AnointmentThis all sounds great for Credo going forward, especially as they are projected to grow EPS this fiscal year by a whopping 600%!But the stock was richly valued before their Q3 FY2025 (ended April) report. Right now at an $8 billion market cap on forward sales of over $500 million, they are conservatively trading over 16X sales.By early March when they reported, CRDO shares had been cut in half from $80 to $40 in just a month just to get back down to earth at 16X sales. So it's safe to say they were trading near 30X sales in Q1 near the stock highs above $80.Part of the big pessimism -- or realism -- even before the trade war tumult, was that Credo's Q3 38% EPS beat and giant 12.5% revenue beat was built around a single large customer who may have contributed as much as 85% of that topline: Amazon.While they didn't disclose Amazon (AMZN) as the big kahuna in their operations, many analysts had sufficient reason to suspect this was the case.""As we shared last quarter, we had seven customers that contributed more than 5% of revenue,"" said Credo Chief Financial Officer Dan Fleming. ""And going forward, we expect that three to four customers will be greater than 10% of revenue in the coming quarters and fiscal year, as additional hyperscalers ramp to more significant volumes.""I think Credo can keep growing and we won't see another quarter so dependent on one large company.What Makes Credo's AECs More Efficient Than Other Cables?Credo's Active Electrical Cables (AECs) stand out for their efficiency and performance in modern data center environments, especially compared to traditional Direct Attached Copper (DAC) and Active Optical Cables (AOC). Here are the key factors:1. Substantial Power SavingsCredo’s AECs consume about 50% less power than traditional DACs and significantly less than AOCs, making them highly energy efficient.For example, their second-generation HiWire LP SPAN AECs reduce power consumption by nearly half while increasing cable reach by 40% compared to the previous generation.2. Thinner, More Flexible CablesCredo’s AECs use thinner copper (as slim as Cat 6 cables), reducing cabling volume by up to 75% compared to passive DACs. This makes them easier to route and manage in dense data center environments.The thinner, lighter cables also support longer distances and tighter bend radii, which is critical for modern rack-to-rack and server-to-switch connections.3. Superior Performance and ReliabilityIntegrated digital signal processors (DSPs) and retimers in Credo’s AECs deliver better signal integrity, enabling higher data rates (up to 800G and 1.6T) over longer distances without degradation.These cables offer extreme reliability, with Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) ratings up to 100 million hours, minimizing downtime and maintenance.4. Plug-and-Play SimplicityCredo’s AECs are hot-swappable and easy to deploy, providing a drop-in replacement for AOCs and DACs without the need for additional components or complex configuration.They also support advanced features like dual Top-of-Rack (TOR) redundancy for enhanced reliability in hyperscale data centers.5. Lower Environmental ImpactBy reducing power consumption and using less plastic and copper, Credo’s AECs help customers decrease their environmental footprint.Relentless Connectivity Innovation for AINow that you know Credo's key ""connector"" role in the AI economy, let me highlight recent press releases that you should go find on their website if you are interested in learning more...March 18: Credo and XConn to Showcase Seamless GPU Cluster at NVIDIA GTCMarch 26: Credo to Showcase AI Scale Out Fabric Featuring Credo Optical DSPs at OFC 2025March 27: Credo Named a Winner of the 2025 Top Workplaces USA AwardApril 1: Credo Unveils the Lark Family - Setting a New Benchmark for Low-Power 800G Optical DSPsIf their innovation cadence maintains like this, I'm sure their big customer wins will keep growing.

While the stock is off to a rough start for Q1, his description of their business was exceptional so I want to share it for your own due diligence...Credo aims to break bandwidth barriers in the data infrastructure market. It provides secure, high-speed connectivity solutions that deliver improved power efficiency as data rates and corresponding bandwidth requirements increase exponentially throughout the data infrastructure market.Specifically, Credo’s SerDes and DSP chips optimize data transfer by enabling high-speed, error-free communication within data centers, while its HiWire Active Electrical Cables (AECs) provide efficient, high-bandwidth connections between servers to support AI workloads and large-scale data processing.Many important trends are driving the data infrastructure market, such as cloud workloads, streaming video, 5G wireless deployment, the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), and, most notably, the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. These trends have all created an explosion of data that has stressed existing infrastructure and forced a major shift.(end of Sheraz Mian observations)The rapid adoption of AI and the need for efficient data center connectivity are driving increased demand for Credo’s products among top-tier builders of the AI Economy.Credo is expanding its customer base to include all the major technology firms -- from Apple to Tesla -- and multiple large enterprises in energy and education in the midst.Bottom line on CRDO: If Sheraz hadn't put Credo on my radar, I might not have studied it enough. Now that I know better, I think its a buy in the $40s.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d8dd6423c094b:0-bull-of-the-day-credo-technology-crdo/
"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.""We see Nvidia's leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,"" the analysts said.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Nvidia Stock Falls. Here's What's Weighing on the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1746454380000,"By Adam Clark and Tae KimNvidia stock was falling on Monday as investors assess Big Tech spending on its processors and balance that against potential restrictions on the chip maker's exports.Shares were down 0.7%, at $113.71, in early trading. The stock rose 2.6% on Friday.Nvidia stock rose more than 5% over the past five trading sessions and 17% in the past month, helped by technology companies Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.com all repeating their intention to invest heavily in artificial-intelligence infrastructure, which includes Nvidia's chips.However, Nvidia could be facing a 20% reduction in the long-term $500 billion total addressable market for its hardware from U.S. restrictions on its exports, according to BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya.""China is about half of this, based on China's direct contribution to global cloud capex. The other 10 [percentage] points is variable and will depend on how strictly the U.S. administration implements AI diffusion rules,"" Arya wrote in a research note.Arya kept a Buy rating and $150 target price on Nvidia stock.In April, Nvidia disclosed that future sales of its H20 AI accelerators to China would require a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is generally viewed as unlikely to be granted.Nvidia is now working on the design of its AI chips in order to make a processor that can be exported to China under U.S. restrictions as soon as June, technology-focused news outlet The Information reported over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment on the report.On Monday, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar also quantified the ""worst case"" scenario if Nvidia's top data center customers cut back on spending because of a difficult economic environment over the next year.Kumar estimates 6.5% of the chip maker's data-center revenue — worth about 40 cents of earnings per share — would be lost. Using a 25 times earnings multiple, the stock's downside price would be $76.25.On the flip side, Kumar figures the upside scenario would lead to a price of $177.45.Trading was mixed for two other chip makers. Advanced Micro Devices was up 2% and Broadcom was down 1%.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, ""If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?""Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful.

Chip Shares Tumble After Nvidia Discloses Export Restrictions,1744810680000,"By Denny JacobExport restrictions placed on certain chips manufactured by Nvidia have weighed on other chipmakers, and shares of Broadcom, Qualcomm and others declined Wednesday.Nvidia, which has become a proxy for chipmakers given its booming valuation and chips powering artificial-intelligence capabilities, faces new hurdles. The chip company on Tuesday said it would record a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings and disclosed the U.S. will now require a license for exporting the company's H20 processors to China and other countries.Wedbush analysts said that, while the financial impact is relatively small, the requirement is a strategic blow to Nvidia going after the China market as a trade war develops between the U.S. and China.Investors appear to be betting that such restrictions mean greater risk to business operations to Nvidia and others, raising questions about their valuations and prospects in a scenario in which the two largest economies continue to impose levies against each other.Nvidia was down 6.8% to $104.56 in premarket trading. Broadcom declined 4.3% to $171.34, Qualcomm was off 2.9% to $134.64, and Micron Technology shed 5.7% to $67. Marvell Technology declined 5.1% to $50.62, and Advanced Micro Devices retreated 7.7% to $87.94.While announced tariffs have caused a broader selloff, companies in the technology space have faced particular challenges, as questions about valuations had been bubbling before the Trump administration announced tariffs. Uncertainty about the administration's approach and desired endgame have increased as tariffs have been announced and paused. While certain products, including electronics at large, have appeared to be exempted, definitive measures have changed over short periods.Write to Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250416004931:0-chip-shares-tumble-after-nvidia-discloses-export-restrictions/

"Market Chatter: Intel Considers Divesting Networking, Edge Businesses",1747733728000,"Intel NASDAQ:INTC has contemplated selling its network and edge businesses, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter. The chipmaker is considering a potential sale because the businesses in its former NEX group no longer seem relevant to the focus that Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan has adopted for the company, two sources told the news agency. The unit will no longer help Intel's core strategy, Reuters reported, citing a source. The company may sell its networking business because Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and other firms have a tight grip on key parts of that market, according to the report. Intel has not yet launched a formal deal process for the unit, or solicited bidders, Reuters reported, citing two sources. The company recently interviewed investment bankers to pick an adviser for the sales process, though it has not yet hired a banker, according to the report. Intel didn't immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250520:A3381640:0/
Global chipmakers feel the pinch of Trump's shifting trade policy,1744808554000,"Global chip stocks were battered on Wednesday on fresh evidence of how U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting trade policy was complicating the outlook for semiconductor and computing giants, including AI pioneer Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and its rival AMD NASDAQ:AMD .Attempts to reorient global trade through tariffs and export curbs have started to show the effect as Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit after Washington restricted exports of its AI processor tailored for China, while Dutch chip-making tools giant ASML raised doubts about its outlook. The U.S. restriction, which also hit the MI308 processor of Advanced Micro Devices, marked the latest blow for the AI chip trade that is losing steam after a two-year rally as tariff threats and fears over Big Tech's spending weigh on sentiment. Nvidia shares closed down nearly 7% on Wednesday, with the company losing more than $148 billion in market value. AMD fell 5.8% as it warned of a $800 million hit from the latest curb, while AI-related chip stocks including Arm NASDAQ:ARM , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and Micron NASDAQ:MU dropped between 2.5% and 4.6%.Nvidia said on Wednesday that it follows the U.S. government's directions on where it can sell its chips after the U.S. Commerce Department announced on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 chips.""The U.S. government instructs American businesses on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter,"" Nvidia said. ""The technology industry supports America when it exports to well-known companies worldwide - if the government felt otherwise, it would instruct us,"" the company added. Tightening U.S. export curbs have in recent years made it harder for American chipmakers to tap the Chinese market, but the country remains a key source of revenue. ""The U.S. export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chips highlight the growing geopolitical uncertainty enveloping the tech and semiconductor sectors, particularly under Trump-era-style policy reversals,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital. ""This unpredictability rattles businesses and investment markets, as evidenced by Nvidia's selloff this morning and broader pressure across chip stocks."" Nvidia drew over 13% of its sales, or about $17 billion, from China in its last financial year, although that was down from 21% in fiscal 2023. For AMD, China was its second-largest market last year, accounting for more than 24% of total sales. ""The H20 portion was about $12 billion or so (of the total China revenue), roughly about 30 cents of earnings per share, not trivial but not enormous in the grand scheme of things,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""H20 performance is low, well below already-available Chinese alternatives; a ban essentially simply hands the Chinese AI market over to Huawei.""Rasgon said the move may have surprised many investors as shares had surged nearly 18% last week, partly due to a report that the Trump administration planned to back off from such a curb after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner.The company had earlier this week unveiled plans to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, a move largely seen as an overture to Trump. Trump has for now exempted semiconductors and some other electronics from his tariffs, but he has warned that sector-specific levies will be announced in the coming weeks. Such tariffs could cost U.S. semiconductor equipment makers more than $1 billion a year, Reuters reported on Tuesday.NVIDIA FALLOUT News of the latest export curb on Nvidia sparked a selloff in chip companies and its suppliers across the globe. In South Korea, Samsung KRX:005930 closed down about 3%, while SK Hynix KRX:000660 closed 4% lower. European chipmakers ASM International EURONEXT:ASM and Infineon Technologies XETR:IFX fell more than 2%, while Japanese chip-testing equipment maker Advantest TSE:6857 - an Nvidia supplier - was the Nikkei's second-worst performer with a 5% tumble. Still, some analysts said Nvidia's overall sales have continued to surge even as the China contribution slows while chip demand remains strong from big cloud companies.""While we acknowledge the likely impact to near-term numbers, we would stress that Blackwell shipments to core hyperscale customers remains the driver of fundamentals,"" TD Cowen analysts said, referring to Nvidia's latest line of AI systems.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QU0U8:0-global-chipmakers-feel-the-pinch-of-trump-s-shifting-trade-policy/"
"ALAB Set to Report Q1 Earnings: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?",1746212400000,"Astera Labs ALAB is scheduled to report first-quarter 2025 results on May 6.For the first quarter of 2025, the company expects revenues between $151 million and $155 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $153.34 million, indicating a year-over-year increase of 134.97%.For the first quarter of 2025, the company expects non-GAAP earnings between 28 cents and 29 cents per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 28 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days.

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar)Astera Labs, Inc. Stock Price and EPS SurpriseAstera Labs, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Astera Labs, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Have Influenced Q1 PerformanceAstera Labs’ first-quarter 2025 revenues are likely to have benefited from increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers and data center infrastructure. Strong momentum across its three key product families, Aries, Taurus, and Leo, is likely to have contributed well. The Aries peripheral component interface express (PCIe) retimers and Taurus Ethernet product lines are expected to have driven significant revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. With continued adoption across AI platforms and general-purpose compute systems, these products are likely to have sustained high demand in the first quarter. Revenues from Taurus 400 gig Ethernet solutions are expected to have contributed significantly to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by both AI and general-purpose compute infrastructure applications.The expansion of the Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch family, which is already generating preproduction shipments, is expected to have contributed positively in the first quarter.ALAB Stock Underperforms Sector and IndustryALAB shares have plunged 45.1% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decrease of 8.9% and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 15.2%. The underperformance can be attributed to concerns over the lower-than-expected gross margin driven by a shift in product mix toward hardware-based solutions. Along with this, a broader market weakness in the tech sector and persistent fear over mounting tariffs by the current government have added to the pressure.YTD ALAB Stock PerformanceALAB Stock is Currently OvervaluedALAB stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 15.36X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 5.71X.Price/Sales Ratio (Forward 12 Months)ALAB Benefits From Expanding PortfolioALAB’s expanding portfolio is expected to have been a key catalyst. The company recently announced the ramp-up of production for its purpose-built PCIe6 connectivity portfolio, which includes gearbox solutions, fabric switches, retimers, and active cable modules. It aims to enhance the performance, scalability, and efficiency of AI and cloud infrastructure systems while supporting longer-distance connectivity with optical media for advanced AI platforms. Benefits from this announcement are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.ALAB’s expanding portfolio is expected to have helped it fend off competition from other industry players like Broadcom AVGO, which is also making strong efforts in the PCIe Retimer market.In February 2025, Broadcom announced the availability of its end-to-end PCIe Gen6 portfolio, advancing AI infrastructure solutions through successful interoperability testing with Micron and Teledyne LeCroy.Additionally, Broadcom’s introduction of scalable, high-performance, and low-power 400G PCIe Gen 5.0 Ethernet adapters aims to transform data centers by resolving connectivity bottlenecks.ALAB Powers AI Advancements With Top ChipmakersAstera Labs has made a significant impact on the AI industry with collaborations with top chipmakers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology, and Intel. This is likely to have driven growth during the first quarter.ALAB recently introduced its Scorpio Smart Fabric Switches for PCIe 6-ready NVIDIA Blackwell-based MGX platforms, delivering high-performance, modular scalability for AI and cloud infrastructure.With comprehensive design-in collateral and interoperability validation in its Cloud-Scale Interop Lab, ALAB enhances NVIDIA MGX platform integration by optimizing GPU utilization, improving energy efficiency, and enabling advanced rack-level management through its COSMOS software.Advanced Micro Devices also continues to utilize Astera Labs solutions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of its AI-driven products. The partnership between Advanced Micro Devices and Astera Labs strengthens both companies’ positions in the AI market, fueling advancements in next-gen technologies.Conclusion: Hold ALAB Stock for NowDespite a strong product portfolio, ALAB faces increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets, particularly from larger semiconductor companies that are ramping up their product offerings for AI infrastructure. This competition is expected to hurt the company’s financial performance. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainties and stretched valuations are concerns.Astera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

Buy 5 Big AI Laggards of Q1 That Found Wings and Soared Past Month,1747659600000,"U.S. stock markets closed first-quarter 2025 on a negative note after two years of an impressive bull run. The technology sector, particularly artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, suffered the most following the Fed’s ambiguity about further lowering interest rates anytime soon and the fear of a near-term recession. In the first half of second-quarter 2025, Wall Street remained more volatile due to the Trump administration’s tariffs and trade policies, as well as their impact on the U.S. economy, particularly on an already elevated inflation rate.Despite this headwind, several AI stocks that lagged in the first quarter have flourished in the past month. Here, we recommend five such AI stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful in the near term. These stocks are: AppLovin Corp. APP, Amphenol Corp. APH, Arista Networks Inc. ANET, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Twilio Inc. TWLO. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings growth potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.AppLovin Corp.Zacks Rank #1 AppLovin is engaged in building a software-based platform for mobile app developers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their apps in the United States and internationally. APP provides a technology platform that enables developers to market, monetize, analyze and publish their apps. AppLovin’s last reported financial results demonstrate its strong fundamentals and growth potential. The introduction of APP’s AI-powered AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion in gaming studios have significantly boosted revenue growth. APP’s Ai-enabled Audience+ marketing platform is also boosting its reach into direct-to-consumer and e-commerce space. AppLovin has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 24.3% and 85.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 25.6% in the last 30 days. Amphenol Corp. Zacks Rank #1 Amphenol provides connectivity solutions using AI and ML (machine learning) technologies. It provides AI-powered high-density, high-speed connectors and cables, and interconnect systems optimized for signal integrity and thermal performance. Amphenol benefits from a diversified business model. APH’s strong portfolio of solutions, including high-technology interconnect products, is a key catalyst. Expansion of spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies bodes well for APH’s top-line growth. Apart from Defense, APH’s prospects ride on strong demand for its solutions across Commercial Air, Industrial and Mobile devices. The Andrew acquisition is expected to add roughly $0.09 to earnings in 2025. APH’s diversified business model lowers the volatility of individual end markets and geographies. Its strong cash-flow-generating ability is noteworthy.Amphenol has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 32.3% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% in the last seven days. Arista Networks Inc.Zacks Rank #2 Arista Networks is well-positioned with the right network architecture for client-to-campus data center cloud and AI networking backed by three guiding principles. These include the best-in-class, highly proactive products with resilience, zero-touch automation and telemetry with predictive client-to-cloud one-click operations with granular visibility and prescriptive insights for deeper AI algorithms.ANET’s EOS Smart AI Suite and Arista AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) enhance AI job monitoring, deep-dive analytics, and proactive performance issue resolution. Its AI suite also focuses on network security and optimization.ANET’s AI-powered cloud networking solutions provide predictable performance and programmability, enabling seamless integration with third-party applications for network management, automation and orchestration. Arista AVA offers augmentation of pervasive visibility, continuous threat detection, and enforcement. The growing demand for 200- and 400-gig high-performance switching products augurs well for ANET’s long-term growth. Arista Networks has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.7% and 12.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4% in the last 30 days. Broadcom Inc.Broadcom has been benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Strong demand for AVGO’s application-specific integrated chips, designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of fiscal first quarter, roughly 70% of Broadcom’s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation. AVGO’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential.AVGO’s XPUs are necessary for training generative AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. AVGO’s next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom remains on track for volume shipment of these XPUs to its hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as specific hyperscalers have started to develop their own XPUs. Broadcom believes that by 2027 each of its three hyperscalers would deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone.Broadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21% and 35.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% in the last 60 days.Twilio Inc.Zacks Rank #2 Twilio is a leading provider of cloud communications Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS) in the United States and internationally. TWLO is focusing on generative AI offerings to tap the growing opportunities in this space. In this regard, TWLO launched Customer AI technology in June 2023, which powerfully combines customer engagement platform data, generative and predictive AI, and large language models (LLMs) to unlock stronger customer relationships for brands. TWLO is integrating generative AI capabilities across its platform and every customer touch point. The company believes that by training LLMs for customers with their data inside its Segment customer data platform, Twilio will be able to help customers enter the AI race multiple steps ahead of their peers. TWLO has also partnered with Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) for Google Cloud to integrate generative AI into the Twilio Flex customer engagement platform. Twilio’s initiative to integrate generative and predictive AI technology across its platform is likely to boost its revenue growth over the long-run. Twilio enables companies to create personalized, customer-aware experiences powered by OpenAI. Through this integration, Twilio customers will be able to use OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to power new generative capabilities in Twilio Engage, its multichannel marketing solution built on the Segment Customer Data Platform.Twilio has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.8% and 21.3%, respectively, for the current year.

ONTO Slides 13% in a Month: How Should Investors Play the Stock?,1744804860000,"Onto Innovation ’s ONTO shares have lost 12.8% in the past month, which is narrower than the Nanotechnology industry’s decline of 14.2%. Over the same time frame, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite have registered declines of 6.7% and 4.9%, respectively. Escalating trade tensions and tariff troubles have been a drag on the overall market performance. Price performanceONTO stock inched up 0.3% in the last trading session and closed at $120.47. The stock is trading 50% below its 52-week high of $238.93, reached on July 16, 2024. When a stock is trading much below 52-week high, it can either be a golden opportunity or a value trap. Investors looking to invest or already holding the stock must be contemplating how to play ONTO stock given its low price relative to 52-week high.Let us understand the company’s fundamentals and ascertain the best course of action for your portfolio.ONTO’s Growth DriversAs the complexity of leading devices is rapidly increasing, manufacturers and fabless companies need better ways to measure physical features such as film thickness and feature sizes. Equipped with a best-in-class suite of semiconductor materials, Onto Innovation is focused on process control and well positioned to capitalize on almost every aspect of the semiconductor industry, including 5G, 3D NAND and advanced packaging.The industry's transition to 3D NAND is helping the company to further expand the available market. To strengthen its foothold, Onto launched innovative products in 2024 designed to support next-generation 3D interconnect technology and inspection tools for unpatterned wafers, panel-level packaging and compound semiconductors.Onto Innovation delivered a strong performance throughout 2024, with the fourth quarter being its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. AI-driven semiconductor packaging is a rapidly growing market and Onto Innovation has capitalized on this emerging trend with cutting-edge solutions. The 180% year-over-year growth in AI-packaging revenues for 2024 highlights robust demand for Onto’s metrology and inspection tools. AI packaging was Onto's top market for the quarter, fueled by significant growth in shipments supporting 2.5D Logic packaging.Advanced nodes continue to drive Onto Innovation’s revenue growth. Driven by four consecutive quarters of growth in this segment, ONTO projects momentum to persist in 2025 as well. During the fourth quarter, both logic and memory gained traction, with the maximum increase in gate-all-around revenues nearly doubling from the previous quarter.In addition to the growth of Atlas OCD tools, demand for Iris film metrology rose, driven by successful qualifications in memory, logic and packaging, bringing annual revenues close to $100 million. ONTO expects continued demand for Iris films in 2025 with the expansion of its customer base and market footprint.Power revenues increased 10% in 2024, despite weak end-market demand led to delays in several customer expansions. As the demand for power usage elevates among data centers, ONTO is focused on developing advanced gallium nitride-based power semiconductors that are gaining traction due to their advantages in power efficiency, compact size and higher density compared with silicon.For 2025, management expects total revenues in this segment to surpass the record set in 2024. It anticipates a seasonal dip in the first quarter, followed by rise in the subsequent quarters, aligning with the growth trends seen in 2024. In support of a $69 million volume purchase deal with a top DRAM manufacturer, management forecasts strong revenue growth in DRAM in the first quarter. Followed by a solid fourth-quarter performance, gate-all-around demand is expected to rise, while increased NAND orders are likely to support expansion and the growing need for high-stack 3D NAND.Given these drivers, management expects revenues in the range of $260-$274 million for the first quarter of 2025. Non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be between $1.40 and $1.54.Challenges Loom for ONTONon-GAAP operating expenses totaled $68.4 million, up 21.4% year over year. The metric reached the upper end of the guidance on higher R&D investments throughout the quarter. While R&D is crucial for long-term competitiveness, the increasing expense base could weigh down on profitability, especially if revenue growth stalls or macro conditions worsen.Uncertain macro backdrop and escalating geopolitical/trade tensions could upset supply chains and impact the semiconductor industry. This does not bode well for ONTO.Intense competition in the semiconductor vertical and forex volatility are additional concerns.Analysts remain cautious, as witnessed in the downward earnings estimate revision activity over the past 60 days.ONTO’s Expensive ValuationONTO stock is trading at a premium with forward 12-month price/earnings multiple of 18.03X compared with the industry’s 3.70X. Conclusion: Hold ONTO for NowWhile Onto Innovation has strong structural tailwinds, its near-term investment profile is clouded by uncertain global macro backdrop, geopolitical and trade tensions along with intense competition. Increasing operating costs also emerge as a concern.Therefore, we believe new investors should wait for a better entry point and existing investors should retain ONTO stock, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth consideration in the broader technology space are Broadcom AVGO, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and NETGEAR Inc NTGR. While AVGO flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), CSCO and NTGR presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.

Broadcom and JinkoSolar have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1746188580000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 2, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Broadcom AVGO as the Bull of the Day and JinkoSolar JKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford F, Tesla TSLA and General Motors GM .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Broadcom manufactures and sells semiconductors that are used in a range of technology products, such as smartphones, AI data centers, and the automotive industry, to name a few. Semiconductor solutions accounted for roughly 60% of 2024 revenues.AI-Related CapEX Remains StrongWhile the names of companies may come and go, and each moment in history on Wall Street is unique, every bull cycle has an underlying theme. That is, one growth industry that drives so much growth that it can lead the market up and down. For instance, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the key industry was railroads. The innovation was so novel and game-changing that it produced the most growth, profits, and speculation. The late 1990s saw the internet craze lead the US stock market higher and ultimately lower.Today, that industry is artificial intelligence. Grand View Research predicts that the global AI market will balloon to more than $1.8 trillion over the next five years, racking up a compound annual growth rate of ~35%. CapEx, or Capital Expenditure spending mostly from America’s cash-rich big tech companies, is the key to determining AI growth and, thus, Broadcom’s potential earnings growth. As earnings season hits its stride, Broadcom and other big tech companies are receiving welcome news on the CAPEX front.Semiconductor RestrictionsRestrictions on sending semiconductors overseas are an equally big threat to the semiconductor business. Yesterday, the Trump White House eased some of those concerns when it said it is considering easing restrictions after Nvidiaand other semiconductor juggernauts pushed for rule changes.AVGO: Expect Big Earnings GrowthBroadcom benefits from robust demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Last year, AI revenues bolted 220% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that AVGO will grow 42.73% this quarter, and 35.52% for full-year 2025.Broadcom Announces Massive Buyback ProgramDuring last quarter’s earnings conference call, AVGO management announced a massive $10 billion buyback. Share buybacks are bullish because they reduce the supply of stock available in the market, often leading to higher share prices.AVGO is a Perennial EPS WinnerAVGO has not missed Wall Street estimates in at least 5 years.Bottom LineFueled by explosive AI growth, strong CapEx spending from tech giants, and a gigantic share buyback program, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution.Bear of the Day:Zacks Rank #5 stock JinkoSolar is a Chinese manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules and energy systems. JinkoSolar builds a vertically integrated solar product through its supply chain, which is recovered from silicon materials or solar modules. The company’s primary products are silicon wafers, solar cells, and solar modules, which are all PV. JKS has residential, commercial, and utility scale projects globally and is focused on sustainability and clean energy innovation.Tariff Wars Lead to Uncertainty for Chinese Solar IndustryWith the intensifying trade war between the United States and China, uncertainty abounds on Wall Street. The Trump administration’s attempt to negotiate bilateral trade deals globally has sparked heated rhetoric, tit-for-tat threats and tariffs, and uncertainty on Wall Street. Though it appears that the Trump team has made progress with some countries, China and the United States remain miles apart.For instance, over the past few days, the Trump team has claimed that talks are being held between the two adversaries, while the Chinese government has denied such claims. Meanwhile, Trump officials such as Treasury Scott Bessent say that a deal with China could take as long as two or three years.For years, President Trump has alleged that China is “dumping cheap product” on the United States and other countries. It’s not just right-leaning politicians saying this, either. In 2024, then-Treasury Secretary Jant Yellen warned that China is treating the global economy as a dumping ground for cheap, clean energy products. In other words, the Chinese government subsidizes clean energy companies so that their prices are artificially low, putting local companies out of business.When those companies exit the market, the Chinese companies hike prices. In response to this threat, Trump has set solar tariffs as high as 3,521% in Asia! While this is likely a positive for US solar companies like First Solarand Tesla , it essentially means that the US market is non-existent to companies like JinkoSolar.JKS Earnings Are Likely to SlideWall Street analysts are incredibly bearish on Jinko’s future and expect EPS to crater 453.85% this year!JKS Is a LaggardJKS shares exhibit relative price weakness and are down 28.2% year-to-date, dramatically underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Meanwhile, shares are stuck below the key moving averages and are carving out a bear flag structure.Bottom LineJinkoSolar, a major Chinese manufacturer of solar PV products, faces several bearish headwinds due to trade tensions between the US and China.Additional content:Buy, Sell or Hold Ford Stock Ahead of Q1 Earnings?Ford is slated to release first-quarter 2025 results on May 5, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s EPS and automotive revenues is pegged at breakeven and $35.5 billion, respectively.The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has moved up by 2 cents over the past seven days.

The company’s sales declined 1.3% in the to-be-reported quarter to 501,291 units. The drop was mainly due to the timing of rental fleet sales and the discontinuation of the Ford Edge and Transit Connect. However, retail sales grew 5% during the quarter. Sales of Ford’s electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, jumped 25.5% to 73,623 units.Tesla was another auto biggie that saw its deliveries drop in the quarter under discussion. It delivered 336,681 EVs, which fell 13% year over year. Meanwhile, Ford’s closest peer General Motors sold 693,363 units in the first quarter of 2025, up 17% year over year.Ford had notified on its last earnings call itself that the company will sell fewer internal combustion engine vehicles compared to 2024. Additionally, a shift in product mix and foreign exchange headwinds will drag profits.Ford had guided breakeven adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2025, marking a sharp drop from $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to lower volumes, a 20% production cut and plant launch activities.Here’s a rundown of the estimates for Ford’s revenues and EBIT for key segments for the three months ended March 31.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford Blue unit (comprising ICE and hybrid models) is pegged at $17.6 billion, implying a decrease of 19% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBIT is $275 million, down from $905 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford model e unit (comprising of electric vehicles) is pegged at $1.5 billion, compared with $115 million in the corresponding period in 2024. The consensus mark for the segment’s loss before interest and taxes is $1.17 billion, narrower than $1.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford Pro unit (encompassing commercial vehicles and services) is pegged at $16.2 billion, implying a decline of 10% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBIT is $1.5 billion, suggesting a decline from $3 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2024.F’s Price Performance & ValuationYear to date, shares of Ford have inched up 1.1%, outperforming the industry. It has also performed better than Tesla and General Motors, whose shares have plunged 30% and 15%, respectively, so far in 2025.From a valuation perspective, Ford is trading relatively cheap. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.24, below the industry’s 2.37. The company has a Value Score of A. Meanwhile, Tesla looks too pricey at a forward sales multiple of 8.57, whereas General Motors’ P/S sits at 0.25.How to Play Ford Pre-Q1 EarningsFord is indeed facing challenges. Widening EV losses, weakening ICE performance and auto tariffs threaten margins and earnings. Its 2025 outlook is soft and doesn’t even account for tariffs. Full-year adjusted EBIT is forecast at $7-$8.5 billion, down from $10.2 billion in 2024. Warranty costs and generous incentives will weigh on margins and overall profitability. However, not all is gloom and doom.The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future for the Ford Pro segment. While the 2025 EBIT guidance for the segment implies a year-over-year decline, it is still expected to be the major profit driver for the company. Additionally, Ford’s high dividend yield of roughly 6% is quite appealing to income-focused investors. The company targets a payout ratio of 40-50% of free cash flow, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns. Ford’s strong liquidity position provides a cushion, with $28 billion in cash and around $47 billion in total liquidity at the end of 2024.So, all in all, it is worth holding on to Ford stock now. However, investing ahead of its upcoming results doesn’t seem a good idea. It’s better to wait for management’s commentary on tariffs and updated 2025 guidance to see the potential impact.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"
Bull of the Day: Broadcom (AVGO),1746172800000,"Broadcom Company OverviewZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Broadcom ( AVGO ) manufactures and sells semiconductors that are used in a range of technology products, such as smartphones, AI data centers, and the automotive industry, to name a few. Semiconductor solutions accounted for roughly 60% of 2024 revenues.AI-Related CapEX Remains StrongWhile the names of companies may come and go, and each moment in history on Wall Street is unique, every bull cycle has an underlying theme. That is, one growth industry that drives so much growth that it can lead the market up and down. For instance, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the key industry was railroads. The innovation was so novel and game-changing that it produced the most growth, profits, and speculation. The late 1990s saw the internet craze lead the US stock market higher and ultimately lower.Today, that industry is artificial intelligence. Grand View Research predicts that the global AI market will balloon to more than $1.8 trillion over the next five years, racking up a compound annual growth rate of ~35%. CapEx, or Capital Expenditure spending mostly from America’s cash-rich big tech companies, is the key to determining AI growth and, thus, Broadcom’s potential earnings growth. As earnings season hits its stride, Broadcom and other big tech companies are receiving welcome news on the CAPEX front:· Alphabet ( GOOGL ) reiterated its gargantuan CapEx guidance.· Meta Platforms ( META ) hiked their already massive CapEX projections.· Microsoft ( MSFT ) reiterated CapEx guidance.Semiconductor RestrictionsRestrictions on sending semiconductors overseas are an equally big threat to the semiconductor business. Yesterday, the Trump White House eased some of those concerns when it said it is considering easing restrictions after Nvidia ( NVDA ) and other semiconductor juggernauts pushed for rule changes.AVGO: Expect Big Earnings GrowthBroadcom benefits from robust demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Last year, AI revenues bolted 220% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that AVGO will grow 42.73% this quarter, and 35.52% for full-year 2025.Broadcom Announces Massive Buyback ProgramDuring last quarter’s earnings conference call, AVGO management announced a massive $10 billion buyback. Share buybacks are bullish because they reduce the supply of stock available in the market, often leading to higher share prices.AVGO is a Perennial EPS WinnerAVGO has not missed Wall Street estimates in at least 5 years.Bottom LineFueled by explosive AI growth, strong CapEx spending from tech giants, and a gigantic share buyback program, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:eec5d47b0094b:0-bull-of-the-day-broadcom-avgo/

Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals — Barrons.com,1747634400000,"By Tae KimAmid the gold rush to build data centers and AI models, Nvidia has sold the most sought-after tools, driving triple-digit annual sales growth and turning the company into a $3 trillion market value giant.For the most part, Nvidia sells a ""full-stack AI solution"" that includes computer processors, or CPUs, networking equipment, and the AI accelerator, also known as the GPU. It's inside an Nvidia-designed server rack. Together, these components helped to train and serve new AI models.But now Nvidia is taking a significant step toward opening its platform, allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chip. It offers the option for future Nvidia racks with, say, Nvidia and Qualcomm chips inside.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the move on Monday at the COMPUTEX trade show in Taiwan. The new system is called NVLink Fusion.""A tectonic shift is under way: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected — AI is being fused into every computing platform,"" Huang said. ""NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures.""Nvidia's current top-of-the-line GB200 NVL72 AI server rack system includes Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.Initial NVLink Fusion AI chip partners include MediaTek, Marvell, and AIchip. Fujitsu and Qualcomm are the initial CPU partners.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack scale architecture, we're advancing our vision of high-performance, energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Qualcomm Technologies CEO Cristiano Amon said in a press release.The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's ecosystem when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology.For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its server platform and to drive more revenue.There's one catch: Broadcom, which makes many of the custom AI chips for large tech companies, wasn't on Nvidia's initial partner list, though the company said more partners could be added in the future.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Global chip stocks slide as Nvidia warns of big hit from U.S. export curbs,1744801203000,"Global chip stocks slumped on Wednesday after Washington curbed exports of an AI chip Nvidia had tailored for China, further cutting off the crucial growth market for semiconductors in a move that will cost the AI pioneer $5.5 billion in charges.Nvidia said the charges it would incur is a result of U.S. restricting the export of its H20 AI chip to China, along with AMD's NASDAQ:AMD MI308 and their equivalents. The export curbs to China have in recent years squeezed U.S. companies, but the country remains a crucial revenue source with Nvidia drawing more than 13% of its sales, or some $17 billion, from China in its last fiscal year.Meanwhile, ASML EURONEXT:ASML , the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, cautioned that tariffs were adding to the uncertainty for its outlook for 2025 and 2026, sending its shares down over 4%.""We are not surprised that there are limits to H20...but the constraint there is supply, so a more sudden reduction in H20 - and given the inventory writedown, a higher revenue expectation going forward for H20 - will likely be disruptive to revenue and earnings,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said. Shares of Nvidia were down 5%, AMD dropped over 6%, while Micron Technology NASDAQ:MU , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and Intel NASDAQ:INTC fell between 2% to 4% in premarket trading.Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst, said banning the H20 Chip 'makes no sense' as it would hand over the Chinese AI market to rivals Huawei.U.S. officials have been aiming to prevent the sale of critical chip to China in an effort to maintain a competitive edge in the AI race.""The impact of a full H20 wipeout is probably (about)30 cents or so at current levels (not enormous in the grand scheme of things),"" Rasgon said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QU0Q5:0-global-chip-stocks-slide-as-nvidia-warns-of-big-hit-from-u-s-export-curbs/"

Growth Stocks Are the Place to Be After Microsoft and Meta Earnings — Barrons.com,1746121260000,"By Jacob SonenshineMicrosoft and Meta Platforms' robust earnings proved growth stocks are the place for smart investors to keep their money.Investors should own growth stocks beyond these two tech heavyweights, such as companies that supply the data centers critical for their operations, as well as software companies that are benefiting from a similar trend that Microsoft is enjoying.That's because the overall growth picture at Microsoft and Meta looks strong, and signals more spending on data-center products and software ahead. Both companies reported better-than-expected sales and earnings and offered solid guidance.Microsoft projects that its fastest-growing cloud product, Azure, will see second-quarter revenue growth to close to 35% year over year. The product includes artificial intelligence, which makes customers more efficient and is therefore priced higher than many of its other products. That's driving the company's guidance for total sales growth of about 14% in the current quarter.While analysts had begun to worry that software customers would scale back their technology budgets amid tariffs and an uncertain economic outlook, Microsoft's report proves companies have enough confidence to invest.Ultimately, software companies are growing faster — despite the economic backdrop — because their customers are shifting away from traditional ways of storing and analyzing data and toward the new, AI-enhanced offerings. Stock in Salesforce was up 1%, while Oracle shares rose 5%, and ServiceNow rose 1.5%.These stocks have room to rise more, as analysts expect these companies post continued earnings growth. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector Exchange-Traded Fund trades at just over 33 times expected earnings, in aggregate, for the coming 12 months, below its peak of 40 times in the past two years. Analysts are likely to revise Microsoft's — and potentially other software companies' — earnings forecasts higher.Meanwhile, Meta's guidance called for second-quarter sales of $44 billion, implying 13% year-over-year growth. Brands are continuing to increase their advertising spend on Instagram and Facebook, as the company reported strong user engagement, growth in ad impressions, and higher ad prices.That's why other internet and advertising-related names were up Thursday. Alphabet's stock gained 0.9%. The platforms that dominate people's time and attention are winning, as internet companies' AI investments are enabling them to show each user the right content and ads, moving more ad spending onto their platforms. Clearly, brands aren't pulling back on marketing budgets enough to derail this trend.Elsewhere, Pinterest was gaining over 3%, and Trade Desk up 1.5%.The other major positive from the earnings reports was capital investment. Meta said it would grow capital expenditures this year by just over 80% to about $64 billion at the midpoint of the range. That comes just after Alphabet said it, too, will grow capex by double-digits, in percent terms, to $75 billion. Microsoft wants to slow the rate of growth of its capital investments, but analysts still expect growth overall. These companies are building data centers to support their AI capabilities.This is key for all the companies that make products that build data centers. Shares Nvidia, which sees the majority of its sales come from datacenter customers, rose 4% Wednesday. Chip maker Broadcom, which also sells into datacenters, climbed just over 3%. Micron Technology, which is still ramping up its datacenter memory business, edged up just over 2%.Arista Networks, which sells switches to Microsoft and Meta, jumped more than 6%.Vertiv Holdings, which see the majority of its cooling and power equipment sales from datacenters, spiked almost 9%. Peer Eaton, which sees a little less of its revenue from datacenters, gained around 3%.As long as the datacenter and AI trend keeps growing, this laundry list of companies will continue to see earnings growth and stock gains.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

QCOM Unveils Advanced Snapdragon 7 Chipset: Should You Buy the Stock?,1747419780000,"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QCOM recently introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. One of the significant improvements in the new platform is a 65% improvement in AI performance. This will ensure seamless support for various large language models, generative AI assistants and stable diffusion image generation on smartphones. A 30% faster GPU rendering will facilitate improved framerates and smoother gameplay. To improve the gaming experience, the company has included Snapdragon Elite Gaming features into the platform. 27% improvement in CPU performance will ensure seamless multitasking and enhanced system responsiveness.Qualcomm has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs such as HONOR and vivo have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.The solution brings several multimedia capabilities. New camera capabilities include video super resolution, hardware electronic image stabilization and advanced image processing features. The 3GPP release 17 for 5G, along with support for WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0, ensures seamless connectivity. Moreover, support for Snapdragon Sound technology, including Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network technology, ensures premium wireless audio quality.Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series is used primarily in mid-range smartphones. Availability of advanced camera capabilities, action-packed gaming and advanced on-device AI in the Snapdragon 7 series chip set will be a game changer for mid-range smartphone users.QCOM Rides on Portfolio Strength, Innovation and AI FocusThe company has ramped up its efforts to solidify its position in the rapidly growing AI domain. QCOM took the market by storm with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs, Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions. Qualcomm is also witnessing solid market traction in the automotive business. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, automotive revenues rose 59% to $959 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform.These developments suggest Qualcomm is moving beyond the smartphone industry by diversifying its portfolio and venturing into new high-growth verticals such as AI PC, AI data centers, automotive and edge AI industrial IoT technologies and solutions. Its strategy of continuous innovation and portfolio diversification will likely boost commercial prospects.Major Challenges for QCOMSamsung and Apple, Inc. AAPL, which have been major buyers of Qualcomm chips for several years, are now moving toward in-house chip development. Samsung has launched several mobile chips under its Exynos lineup, which are used in both the mid-range and premium smartphone segments. Apple has also introduced several chips for its smartphone and PC products. The company uses the A18 Pro chip for the iPhone 16 Pro series and the A18 for iPhone 16 models. Moreover, in the iPhone 16e model, Apple has replaced the Qualcomm modem previously used in iPhone 15 models with an in-house C1 modem. Such initiatives from long-standing customers are a major concern for Qualcomm.The company is also facing intense competition from MediaTek in the mid-range smartphone segment. In the network space, the company faces competition from Broadcom Inc. AVGO. Despite some major issues, Intel Corporation INTC continues to be the dominant player in the PC market. With innovative launches such as Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors, the company is gaining strong momentum in the AI PC domain. Despite enhanced power efficiency and connectivity of Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, Qualcomm has to match the seamless compatibility that Intel processors offer with existing software to gain a competitive edge. This is a complex endeavor.Qualcomm has an extensive presence in China. Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can significantly impact its operations. However, following negotiations, both the United States and China have decided to temporarily reduce tariffs. If they fail to reach a resolution within this period, tariffs may rise again. This will negatively impact QCOM’s operating margin.Price PerformanceQCOM shares have declined 21% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 20.7%. The company has outperformed Intel but underperformed relative to Broadcom. Intel has declined 32.7%, while Broadcom has surged 64.7%.Estimate Revision Trend of QCOMEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 0.34% to $11.8 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has decreased 1.85% to $12.21. This portrays mixed sentiments about the stock’s growth potential from investors.End NoteQualcomm intends to be the driving force in the next wave of AI innovations. The company’s effort to broaden its market reach beyond the mobile chipset market is an important step toward that direction. The future of AI innovation is not concentrated in a particular sector, but it is dispersed across a vast ecosystem. Hence, Qualcomm’s multi-dimensional approach is creating new revenue-generating opportunities in automotive, industrial IoT, data center, and edge AI domains while also strengthening its leadership position in the mobile chipset industry.However, aggressive competition in the smartphone chipset market and several of QCOM’s client strategy of in-house chip development are likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High exposure to the demanding environment of China is a major concern. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Broadcom: Buy, Hold, Sell? AI & Acquistions Paint Strong Picture",1746107280000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] For shareholders in the world’s second-largest  semiconductor company , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , the last several years have borne incredible fruit. Over the past five years, Broadcom stock has provided a total return of approximately 690% as of the Apr. 30 close. The demand for the company’s AI data center infrastructure offerings may be second only to NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA .Its acquisition of VMware has given it an extremely powerful position in the virtualization market, and Broadcom has made VMware vastly more valuable.However, the huge run-up in the company’s share price begs the question: Can Broadcom sustain gains long-term? The company is trading for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 28x. This is around 38% higher than the forward P/E of the S&P 500 Index, which sits just above 20x.This suggests that the market may be overvaluing Broadcom. But is that really the case, and is Broadcom a buy, hold, or sell right now?This analysis will answer this question by breaking down Broadcom’s two main businesses: semiconductors and software.Broadcom’s Semiconductor Business: Sustaining Strong Growth Is Far From Out of the QuestionBroadcom stock has made most of its hay due to the rabid demand for AI-chips. Sales in this space have been growing at an incredibly fast pace. In 2024, AI-chips and networking solutions grew by 220% . In Q1 2025, the growth rate was 77%. Next quarter, the company sees 44% growth in AI for total AI revenue of $8.5 billion through the first half of 2025.So, growth rates are coming down, but what is the company forecasting?The company believes three hyperscalers will generate a serviceable addressable market (SAM) in AI of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. However, this is not the revenue the company expects to generate, only the size of the potential opportunity. Using the current expected sequential growth rate of 7% , Broadcom’s AI-chip business would be worth around $18 billion by the end of 2025. If it grows at a compound annual growth rate of 44% in 2026 and 2027, at the same rate it expects next quarter, the company’s AI revenue could reach $37 billion by 2027.This would mean it would need to capture about half of this SAM, at the midpoint. This would still be a tall task, but these numbers include only three customers. Overall, there is a significant chance Broadcom could sustain a powerful +40% AI growth rate for multiple years.The company also has a non-AI chip business that is almost as large as its AI-chip business. This business has been shrinking, and so has the non-AI chip industry overall. But, the semiconductor industry is cyclical, so there is a strong chance of a significant recovery.Broadcom’s Software Business Proves It's Not a One-Trick Pony [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] Some say Broadcom's massive growth in software isn’t impressive. They argue it only happened because Broadcom paid $69 billion for VMware. While that is somewhat true when comparing overall software revenues from 2023 to 2024, it is a vast oversimplification. VMware’s revenues came onto the books in Q1 2024, causing Broadcom’s software revenues to increase by 153% versus Q4 2023. However, with the company’s Q1 2025 earnings release, we can see how well Broadcom grew its software revenues organically. They did a fantastic job, with Broadcom increasing software sales by 47%.This is due to key changes the company has made at VMware, and it has more to achieve with VMware. It is still working to shift the remaining 40% of customers to its higher revenue subscription model.The VMware acquisition shows how good the company is at spotting and fixing struggling businesses. This has been part of the company’s playbook for years now. Once Broadcom reduces the massive debt load it took on from VMware, the firm could be in a great position to do so again.This possibility is another reason to be confident in Broadcom’s long-term chances of continuing to appreciate.Broadcom: Strong Outlook and Execution Point to Good Things on the HorizonThe moment when Broadcom was a generational investment might be gone, but the stock still shows great promise. The company’s path to continued and strong growth is not theoretical, but entirely possible.Also, management’s impressive ability to acquire and reinvigorate companies like VMware can create long-term opportunities that are not considered today.Yes, the stock trades at a high multiple, but for good reason. The 28x forward P/E ratio is not outrageous . For long-term growth, Broadcom remains a buy.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:c03bf33bd094b:0-broadcom-buy-hold-sell-ai-acquistions-paint-strong-picture/

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .TSM has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Influence TSM’s Q1 ResultsTaiwan Semiconductor continues to assert its dominance in the semiconductor space, benefiting from a robust industry rebound fueled by the growing prominence of artificial intelligence (AI). The surge in AI-driven applications (in manufacturing and end products) has been a significant catalyst for chipset manufacturers like TSM. The rise of data-centric technologies, especially cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse, has increased the demand for semiconductors, contributing to the company’s business performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Taiwan Semiconductor’s consistent investments in next-generation and specialty technologies are likely to have driven growth in the first quarter. Its leadership in 7nm and 3nm chip technologies has been instrumental, offering advanced capabilities to customers in high-demand industries. The 5nm process technology has also contributed to TSM’s wafer revenues, reflecting the solid market adoption of these smaller, more efficient chipsets. Taiwan Semiconductor's strategic focus on ramping up 3nm production while advancing its 2nm development positions it for continued leadership in the semiconductor space.Taiwan Semiconductor's expansion into high-performance computing (HPC) and smartphone sectors is expected to have bolstered its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s innovative 3nm Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) technology, alongside its range of FinFET options (spanning 4nm, 5nm, 6nm and 7nm nodes), has become a key growth driver, particularly in HPC applications. TSM’s advanced FinFET technologies, such as the enhanced 3nm and plus variants of the 4nm and 5nm chips, have helped it maintain strong momentum in the smartphone market.Taiwan Semiconductor's technological advancements are anticipated to have supported its expansion into automotive, IoT and digital consumer electronics. The adoption of TSM’s multi-project wafer processing service, which helps customers cut costs, is likely to have boosted the company’s top-line growth. This diversification across industries enhances TSM’s resilience and offers multiple revenue streams.However, rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are likely to have hurt Taiwan Semiconductor’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, higher electric prices in Taiwan are anticipated to have negatively hurt its profitability in the first quarter.TSM Stock Price Performance & ValuationTaiwan Semiconductor shares have appreciated 10.6% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s rise of 7.5% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 3.3%. Compared to other major players in the semiconductor space, TSM stock has outperformed Marvell Technology MRVL and Micron Technology MU but underperformed Broadcom AVGO. Over the past year, Broadcom stock gained 33.7%, while shares of Marvell Technology and Micron Technology have plunged 23.8% and 42%, respectively.One-Year Stock Price PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value that Taiwan Semiconductor offers to its investors at the current levels. Currently, TSM is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 16.17X compared with the sector’s 22.41X.TSM Forward 12-Month P/E RatioTaiwan Semiconductor also trades at a lower P/E multiple compared with Broadcom’s 24.91X and Marvell Technology’s 17.95X. However, it has a way higher P/E multiple than Micron Technology’s 7.64X.Investment Thesis for TSM StockTaiwan Semiconductor’s planned capital expenditure of $38-$42 billion in 2025 highlights its commitment to maintaining technological superiority. Its ongoing development of 2nm process technology, promising up to 30% power savings over 3nm chips, is a testament to its focus on efficiency and innovation.Taiwan Semiconductor is also diversifying into high-growth sectors like automotive and the IoT. Automotive chips, driven by trends like electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving, now account for 4% of its revenues, while smartphone chips remain a significant 35%. These initiatives position TSM to capture emerging opportunities across industries.Despite its strengths, Taiwan Semiconductor faces near-term headwinds. Rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are a major concern. These new facilities, while strategically important for diversification, are expected to dilute gross margins by 2-3% annually over the next three to five years due to higher labor and utility costs, coupled with lower initial utilization rates.Higher energy prices in Taiwan, following a 25% electricity hike in 2024, pose additional challenges. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, further cloud the outlook. With significant revenue exposure to China, export restrictions and supply-chain disruptions could pressure Taiwan Semiconductor’s operations.What Should Investors Do With TSM Stock?Taiwan Semiconductor’s technological leadership and strategic investments make it a compelling long-term player in the semiconductor space. However, short-term challenges, including rising costs and geopolitical risks, warrant caution. Though the company has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates, it is prudent for investors to stay away from investing in the stock for now and wait for the upcoming quarterly results to get more clarity about its near-term prospects.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:3b3bb1ee3094b:0-taiwan-semiconductor-set-to-report-q1-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/

Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.MRVL’s Growing Data Center and Networking Market is PositiveMarvell’s custom AI silicon and electro-optics solutions have enabled it to become a leading player in the high-performance computing space. The company is benefiting from hyperscalers’ ramping up their use of custom silicon for AI workloads. In fiscal 2025, AI-based revenues crossed its $1.5 billion target, and Marvell expects to “very significantly” surpass its $2.5 billion AI revenue target in fiscal 2026. Marvell’s management is confident that revenues from its custom XPU solutions will continue expanding in fiscal 2027 and beyond.As AI workloads grow, data centers need enhanced networking and interconnect products. MRVL is capitalizing on this shift with its high-speed optical interconnects, including 800G PAM, 400ZR DCI, and its industry-first 1.6T PAM DSP (digital signal processor), which cuts down on optical module power usage by 20%.Furthermore, the shift from copper to optical connectivity in AI infrastructure represents a massive growth opportunity for the company. MRVL’s Co-Packaged Optics technology and its development of the industry's first 2nm silicon IP for cloud and AI workloads solidify its position in the next-generation networking space.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, MRVL’s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc. Price and ConsensusBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. QuoteHowever, the consensus mark for Marvell’s fiscal 2026 earnings has declined by a penny to $2.76 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 75.16% growth over fiscal 2025.Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMarvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. QuoteBoth AVGO’s and MRVL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Marvell’s average surprise of 4.25% is better than AVGO’s surprise of 3.44%, reflecting a good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: MRVL is Cheaper Than AVGOBoth Marvell and Broadcom are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Marvell shares are trading at 6.54X, lower than AVGO’s 16.12X.MRVL and AVGO ValuationAVGO is a Better Buy Right NowBroadcom’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential. Marvell’s near-term prospects are dull, as customers are rescheduling orders to manage excess chip inventories. The U.S. government’s export restriction on certain Chinese customers is likely to continue to be an overhang on Marvell’s top line.Currently, Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared with Marvell, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Product Expansion Powers Garmin's Outdoor Category Sales Growth in Q1,1746104820000,"Garmin Ltd. GRMN delivered a strong start to fiscal 2025, fueled by an impressive performance in its Outdoor segment. While overall first-quarter results were mixed, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenues and earnings, the company still posted an 11% year-over-year increase in total sales, reaching a record $1.54 billion. Much of that growth came from the Outdoor business, which is quickly becoming Garmin’s most important and profitable unit.In the first quarter, Outdoor segment sales jumped 20% year over year to $438 million, leading all five operating segments in both growth and absolute revenues. Even more notable, the segment generated $129 million in operating income, up 20% from the prior year, with strong gross and operating margins of 64% and 29%, respectively. This performance highlights not only rising demand but also Garmin’s ability to deliver profitability through premium, purpose-built devices.Product Expansion Drives Garmin’s Outdoor SalesGarmin’s sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio has been driving the Outdoor category’s overall performance. The company aggressively expanded its adventure-focused product lineup during the first quarter, targeting niche outdoor sports and lifestyle categories where the brand already has a strong following.The standout release was the Instinct 3 series, a refreshed line of adventure watches now offering a bright AMOLED display. Garmin also introduced new devices in the dive (Descent G2), tactical (tactix 8) and golf (Approach S44/S50) categories, each designed to serve dedicated use cases.This strategy of deepening product offerings within specific activity verticals is clearly paying off. It allows Garmin to better serve enthusiasts who value specialized features and are willing to pay a premium for reliable performance in challenging conditions.The company also launched new handheld GPS products like the Montana series with SOS satellite functionality, as well as the solar-powered Approach G20 GPS for golfers, billed as the first of its kind with unlimited battery life in sunlight.Garmin Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Garmin Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Garmin Ltd. QuoteOutdoor: Garmin’s Most Profitable Growth EngineThe success of the Outdoor segment is especially valuable for Garmin right now as other parts of the business face more uneven conditions. For instance, Marine revenues declined 2% in the first quarter due to promotional timing, while Aviation grew a modest 3%.The Auto OEM segment gained 31% but remains the least profitable, with a $9 million operating loss in the quarter. Fitness, meanwhile, saw a healthy 12% increase thanks to demand for wearables, but its margins trailed those of Outdoor.Outdoor’s high-margin profile gives Garmin a financial cushion and enhances overall earnings quality. It also helps the company absorb macro pressures like U.S.-China tariff impacts, which are estimated to raise annual costs by roughly $100 million. Despite those headwinds, Garmin maintained its full-year EPS guidance at $7.80, a sign of confidence that strengths like Outdoor can support the bottom line.

Broadcom Introduces Industry’s First Incident Prediction Capability to Stop Living-Off-The-Land Attacks,1744722000000,"PALO ALTO, Calif., April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ:AVGO today announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats.Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries.“The inspiration for Incident Prediction came from how GenAI can ‘predict’ the next word when generating text,” said Eric Chien, Fellow, Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Broadcom. “By leveraging our extensive attack chain repository and threat intelligence using advanced AI and ML, Incident Prediction can predict the next four or five possible moves attackers will make in a customer’s environment, disrupt them, and then revert to normalcy right away. As a result, security analysts no longer need to triage the event to figure out mitigation strategies; Incident Prediction does that automatically for them.”With Incident Prediction, SOC analysts and other security professionals can:- Automate mitigation and disrupt attackers : Automatically identify the next steps that a specific attacker will most likely take based on past attack patterns. It then applies mitigation policies to block those predicted actions, disrupting most attacker’s progress before they can reach their end goal of encrypting data or exfiltrating information. - Reduce burden on SOC analysts: Eliminate the need for SOC analysts to manually triage alerts, analyze attack sequences and determine mitigation strategies. It handles this automatically, freeing up analysts to focus on other security priorities. - Avoid business impact: Incident Prediction provides specific granular attacker behaviors to block limiting impact to normal business processes. Common day, but crude mitigation measures, which disrupt business such as quarantining machines, shutting down the network, removing user access, or reimaging machines are largely unnecessary. - Reduce attack surface: Enhancing Symantec Adaptive Protection, which identifies and recommends blocking low-prevalence applications and behaviors to proactively shrink the attack surface. It helps close the “doors” to attackers and their common attack techniques.The use of legitimate software by cybercriminals, the approach used in LOTL attacks, is on the rise. According to “ Ransomware 2025: A Resilient and Persistent Threat ,” a new report by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, LOTL attacks are used by nearly all ransomware actors. Nation-state actors also use them to conduct surveillance or exfiltrate data. And large organizations are not the only victims – mid-market businesses increasingly are targeted. Instead of re-imaging the whole machine or changing everyone’s credentials when an attack is discovered, security professionals can use Incident Prediction to have more granular control over their security by blocking only the attacker’s most likely behaviors to reduce the risk of business disruption and enable a streamlined incident response – as attacks happen – all without additional cost.“Broadcom is focused on providing enterprise-grade security for all organizations, whether they have a mature SOC or a small security team. Incident Prediction delivers on this commitment – organizations can enhance SOC capabilities regardless of sophistication,” said Jason Rolleston, Vice President and General Manager, Enterprise Security Group, Broadcom. “Today, every organization needs to empower their security teams to become faster, stronger and more resilient against highly sophisticated APT groups. With Incident Prediction, they now have an automated system that can flag, act and help protect against cyberattacks – as they happen – faster and more cost-effectively.”See Us At RSAC™ 2025 ConferenceBroadcom is a Gold Sponsor of RSAC™ 2025 Conference, which will take place April 28 – May 1, 2025 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Broadcom will be demonstrating innovations from Symantec and Carbon Black at booth N-5345 in the North Expo. In addition, Broadcom executives will be speaking at the event.

3 Reasons US Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated,1747316940000,"2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.Image Source: CNNThe Nasdaq 100 is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Apple ( AAPL ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Broadcom ( AVGO ) have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative.Image Source: @subutrade.786 Fibonacci & Previous Resistance The S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.Image Source: TradingViewIn addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1ab6aa09a094b:0-3-reasons-us-equities-may-be-short-term-overheated/
"These 2 Chip Stocks Could Be Better Bets Than Nvidia, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1746022500000,"By Adam ClarkWhile Nvidia is the unquestioned leader in artificial-intelligence chips, it could be time to buy shares of its rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom for the next phase of the AI trade, according to Seaport Research Partners.As Nvidia's customers start to seek greater return on investment on their AI spending, then the difficulties of deploying its most advanced systems could become a drawback, according to Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg.Goldberg initiated coverage of Nvidia with a Sell rating and a $100 target price in a research note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, he gave Broadcom a Buy rating and a $230 target price and AMD a Buy rating and $100 target price.Nvidia shares were down 3.6% in morning trading. Broadcom stock fell 2.7% and AMD dropped 3%, as technology stocks suffered amid a raft of weak economic data on Wednesday.""Nvidia is one of the leading beneficiaries of the current AI spending boom, but its prospects are well understood and largely priced into the stock,"" Goldberg wrote.For Broadcom, the positives are directly related to its growing role in AI chips, as it helps large companies, such as Alphabet's Google unit and Meta Platforms, design custom chips.""Any time Nvidia loses share today it is to hyperscalers' internal chip designs, and Broadcom is poised to make a lot of money helping them bring those chips to production,"" Goldberg wrote.Meta executives said recently that its in-house MTIA chips could replace graphics-processing units — the specialty of Nvidia — in some servers and be expanded to power AI training. So far, custom chips have generally been used mainly for inference, the process of generating answers or results from the models, rather than training.The upside for AMD is less directly related to the AI sector. The company is unlikely to gain significant market share from Nvidia in the short term, but it is gradually building up a portfolio to match its larger rival, Goldberg said. It can continue to benefit by taking market share from Intel in data centers more generally, he wrote.""AMD needs to be measured for its execution to roadmap and not its AI sales which we expect to be modest but growing over time,"" the analyst wrote.AMD is expected to launch the MI350 GPU series in the second half of the year. AMD has said the MI350 will deliver 35 times more performance for inference than older chips.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Broadcom Set to Surge as AI Diffusion Rule Ends,1747316880000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Over approximately the last three weeks, markets have been on the rise big-time. The  S&P 500 closed just under $5,900 on May 14, just around 4% lower than the all-time high it reached in February. As market sentiment shifts, Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , a leading semiconductor stock , has emerged as a top beneficiary. Despite at one point being down nearly 38% in 2025, Broadcom is now just slightly in the green this year as of the May 14 close.The announcement of the trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted the stock. Shares jumped almost 12% within two days after the announcement. However, there were other highly positive recent pieces of news for Broadcom that the trade deal may somewhat overshadow.Most notable is that President Trump is ending the Biden-era “AI Diffusion Rule."" Its end has the potential to substantially benefit companies like Broadcom . So, what exactly was the AI Diffusion Rule , and what does its cancellation mean for Broadcom?Understanding the End of AI Diffusion, NVIDIA and AMD See Immediate BenefitThe purpose of the AI Diffusion Rule was to give the U.S. government extensive control over which countries can and cannot get access to advanced AI chips made by American firms . Specifically, it controls chips used to train advanced AI models.The rule categorized countries into three different tiers. Tier 1 countries included many of America’s closest allies. These countries face no restrictions. Tier 2 countries include most other countries. India, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were notable inclusions.These countries were limited in the number of chips they could buy. Tier 3 countries , which include adversaries like China and Russia, were not allowed to buy any advanced chips.Really, the government was trying to specifically prevent China and Russia from getting these chips to slow the advancement of their AI capabilities. With the ending of AI Diffusion , that isn’t likely to change. However, how the United States treats those Tier 2 countries is changing. NVIDIA's NASDAQ:NVDA announcement that it would sell 18,000 of its most advanced chips to Saudi Arabia on the same day the government eliminated the AI Diffusion rule provides evidence of this.Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a huge AI partnership in the country.Overall, the end of AI Diffusion means that chip companies with significant AI capabilities now have a much larger opportunity to sell their most advanced technology to these Tier 2 countries. Many of these countries are extremely wealthy, adding to the size of the opportunity . This extends to Broadcom, but in a slightly different way than NVIDIA and AMD.The End of AI Diffusion: Broadcom Waits Its Turn to CapitalizeBroadcom's custom chips are largely used for AI model inference, rather than primarily for AI model training. Training comes before inference. For countries like Saudi Arabia, this means they need time to train their models with NVIDIA and AMD chips . After that, Broadcom's chips can really make a difference. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO]Thus, the fact that NVIDIA and AMD are striking deals opens up the door for Broadcom to sell large amounts of chips to Tier 2 countries down the line. How long that might take is hard to say, but a big opportunity now exists for Broadcom nonetheless.The benefit to Broadcom comes even though the company hasn’t expressed concerns about AI Diffusion, at least with a specific set of customers. In the company’s last earnings call , Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon specifically asked about this.Rasgon asked whether AI diffusion would impact Broadcom’s design wins or shipments for the three big AI customers the firm is selling to in volume.In response, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said, “To answer your question directly, no, we don't have any concerns."" This underscores Broadcom’s focus on inference chips , which AI Diffusion did not directly impact. However, they were indirectly impacted because training comes before inference. So, with AI Diffusion ending, the positive impact on Broadcom comes from the expansion of its serviceable market.The End of AI Diffusion Adds Another Broadcom TailwindFor the reasons discussed above, Broadcom can win big due to AI Diffusion ending . Its chips now have a strong path forward to getting into the hands of some of these huge Tier 2 countries. But, cashing in will likely take time.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:bbce48cea094b:0-broadcom-set-to-surge-as-ai-diffusion-rule-ends/

TSMC Stock Gets Trump Boost. Intel Thinks It Knows How to Strike Back. — Barrons.com,1746015300000,"By Adam ClarkTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is basking in the approval of the Trump administration for its U.S. investment plans. Intel faces an uphill struggle to compete but has detailed its plan to regain leadership in chip manufacturing, involving a costly bet on new machinery.Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, has claimed the role of the world's leading manufacturer of advanced chips. Now it is planning to spend a total of $165 billion on U.S. factories as it looks to simultaneously defuse the threat of U.S. tariffs on imported semiconductors and Chinese efforts to claim the self-ruled island of Taiwan.The American investment plan has won it the backing of the White House, underlined on Tuesday when Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick visited TSMC's site in Arizona where the company was breaking ground on a third chip-fabrication facility.""We are at TSMC Arizona to celebrate the return of American manufacturing. President Trump's bold leadership and clear direction are driving companies and jobs back to this country at a record pace,"" Lutnick said in a statement.The public endorsement could allay fears TSMC will face levies on its Taiwan-made chips. President Donald Trump has publicly stated he told the company it could face a tax of up to 100% if it doesn't shift more production to the U.S.American depositary receipts of TSMC were rising 1.5% in premarket trading on Wednesday, with the ADRs down 17% so far this year through Tuesday's close.What's good news for TSMC is likely bad news for Intel, which would face an easier path to winning significant chip-manufacturing business if its Taiwanese rival's products faced tariffs.However, Intel is hoping to prove it has superior technology with the 18A process it is launching this year and the next-generation 14A process where low-volume production is planned for 2027. It said Tuesday that multiple customers have said they would build test chips on the new process and noted that research, development, and wafer production will all be U.S.-based.""Intel is committed to building a world-class foundry that serves the growing need for leading-edge process technology, advanced packaging and manufacturing,"" said CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement.One notable difference between Intel and TSMC's plans is that the American company has acquired two of the most advanced lithography tools for manufacturing semiconductors on the market from Dutch company ASML Holding. The high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet, or High NA EUV, machines cost more than 350 million euros each, equivalent to about $398 million.TSMC has publicly been reluctant to order ASML's High NA EUV systems, citing its high cost, and suggested it could continue to use older machines for advanced chip manufacturing.That means there could be a window for Intel to secure a technological lead. However, the company still needs to prove it can attract external customers, with Nvidia and Broadcom reported to be running tests on its 18A process.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"S&P 500 Posts Weekly Jump, Snaps Losing Streak After Tariff Pause",1744404064000,"The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.7% this week after the Trump administration paused most of its retaliatory tariffs. The S&P 500 ended Friday's session at 5,363.36, up significantly from last week's closing level, but down 4.4% for April and 8.8% for the year. The market had a turbulent start to the second quarter amid worries about the economic impacts of the US's sweeping retaliatory tariffs that started earlier this month, prompting sharp stock declines. President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a three-month pause on most tariffs for countries other than China, on which the administration increased its rate to 145%. China retaliated by raising its tariffs on US products to 125%. US consumer sentiment soured in April as year-ahead inflation expectations reached the highest point since 1981, according to a University of Michigan report. The main sentiment gauge slid to 50.8 this month from 57 in March. The consensus was for a 53.5 print in a survey compiled by Bloomberg. The Q1 reporting season began with JPMorgan Chase NYSE:JPM and Morgan Stanley NYSE:MS reporting better-than-expected results on their top and bottom lines while Wells Fargo (WFC)'s earnings topped views but its revenue missed expectations. On a weekly basis, JPMorgan's shares rose 12%, Morgan Stanley's shares added 8.3% and Wells Fargo's shares edged up 2.5%. The technology sector had the largest percentage increase of the week, jumping 9.7%, followed by a 6.5% climb in industrials, a 6.4% rise in communication services and a 5.6% gain in financials. Consumer discretionary, materials, consumer staples, utilities and health care also rose. Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO was the top performer in the technology sector, soaring 24% as the company said its board authorized a share repurchase program to buy back up to $10 billion of common shares. Among industrials, GE Vernova NYSE:GEV had the largest percentage increase of the week, jumping 18%. The company's board declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. Still, energy shed 0.4% and real estate was down 0.2%. Occidental Petroleum NYSE:OXY led the energy sector's decliners, falling 7.1%. Analysts at TD Cowen and Scotiabank downgraded their investment ratings on the stock this week while multiple analysts also lowered their price targets on the shares. Next week will be a heavy earnings week, with reports expected from companies including Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Abbott Laboratories (ABT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Netflix (NFLX) and American Express (AXP). Economic reports will include March import prices, retail sales, industrial production, capacity utilization, housing starts and building permits.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250411:A3351792:0/
Wolfspeed Stock Rises for Third Day. Why Shares Are Suddenly Surging. — Barrons.com,1747234200000,"By Brian SwintWolfspeed, the semiconductor firm that is trying to restructure its debt, looked set to rise for a third consecutive day Wednesday after a report that negotiations among creditors are happening.Apollo Global Management, one of the biggest holders of Wolfspeed's $6.5 billion of debt, is in talks with investment bank Moelis about a restructuring, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The stock plunged 26% Friday after the company said that it faces the risk of not being able to continue as a ""going concern"" on its latest earnings call.Wolfspeed rose 0.5% to $3.89 in Wednesday morning trading after gaining 16% on Tuesday and 1.8% Monday. Coming into the session, it was down almost 6% over the past five days and 42% lower in 2025.Wolfspeed makes silicon-carbide technology for use in the automotive industry and would stand to benefit from renewed interest in chips and artificial intelligence. Its problem is that it was due for funding under President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act that now looks doubtful under President Donald Trump. It has been one of the most shorted stocks on the market this year--short selling is when traders bet that the price of shares will fall.Other chip stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Big names Nvidia, AMD, and Arm were all rising, while others such as Broadcom and Intel were lower. Smaller chip maker Alpha & Omega was falling while peer Indie Semiconductor was rising. The Nasdaq was up 0.4%.Wolfspeed didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy? ",1744398000000,"Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made NVIDIA Corporation NVDA a Wall Street darling for some time. On the other hand, Broadcom Inc. ’s AVGO recent share repurchase plan, along with its planned moves to capitalize on the growing AI field, has delighted income-oriented investors. However, the latest trade war between the United States and several other countries has caused market turmoil, with shares of NVIDIA and Broadcom declining 19.9% and 25.7% year to date. This presents an opportunity to buy these quality stocks at a discounted price for long-term gains. But which stock is the better bargain? Let’s explore – Reasons to be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock NVIDIA leads the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market with over 80% share, giving the Jensen Huang-led company a competitive edge over its peers. More than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc .’s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in demand among developers. At the same time, there is an insane demand for NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips among notable tech firms due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces. The older Hopper chips also maintain steady demand due to their higher quality compared to rival Intel Corporation ’s INTC chips (read more: Can Intel Be the Turnaround Stock of 2025? Is the Time to Buy Now?).NVIDIA, meanwhile, is well-poised to make the most of the increase in AI data center spending. Top cloud computing stocks are fulfilling the increase in demand for AI workloads by acquiring GPUs and are spending $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure. One of NVIDIA’s prominent customers, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, may have reduced data center spending, but Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN are now supporting NVIDIA in this aspect. Reasons to be Bullish on Broadcom Stock Broadcom expects the demand for its custom AI accelerator to increase in the near future and the market size for its execution processing units (XPUs) to touch $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027, way higher than last year’s $12.2 billion. Broadcom’s XPUs can work on a particular workload and even outdo NVIDIA’s GPUs. Moreover, they have the competence to perform tasks more affordably than GPUs. Thus, banking on the rise in demand for accelerator chips, Broadcom is now developing a 2-nanometer AI XPU, which is unique. The company’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), known to support AI and machine learning, are witnessing strong demand as well. NVDA or AVGO: Which Stock is a Better Bargain Buy? No doubt, with GPUs and XPUs gaining popularity in the coming years, and AI infrastructure spending increasing, the future does look bright for both NVIDIA and Broadcom. However, from a long-term perspective, NVIDIA is a better choice than Broadcom. This is because NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently than Broadcom, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, more than AVGO’s 18.5%. NVIDIA has also been able to control its expenditures and generate profits in a much better way than Broadcom since its return on equity (ROE) of 117.6% outshined AVGO’s 38.5%. But from a short-term viewpoint, Broadcom has an upper hand over NVIDIA. After all, Broadcom is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a better-quality business that can keep the company immune to the current market vagaries. Broadcom has increased its dividends 6 times over the past five years, and its payout ratio sits at a healthy 52% of earnings. Broadcom also has sufficient cash balance to pay off its dividends. Check Broadcom’s dividend history here. On the contrary, NVIDIA’s payout ratio sits at a paltry 1% of earnings and the company increased dividends only once in the past five years. Check NVIDIA’s dividend history here. NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

AI-Driven Server and Storage Demand Likely to Boost SMCI's Q3 Earnings,1745927700000,"Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI is preparing to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results this week. Amid an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, the company is well-positioned for another quarter of strong revenue growth.Strong Server and Storage Demand to Fuel SMCI’s Sales GrowthThe Server and Storage Systems segment remains the cornerstone of Super Micro Computer’s financial strength. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.08 billion, marking a 37.4% rise compared to the year-ago quarter.The robust growth forecast is anticipated to have been driven largely by growing demand for graphics processing unit (GPU)-optimized servers tailored for AI workloads. SMCI has been capitalizing on strong customer interest in both air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled (DLC) rack-scale platforms, which are essential for the next wave of AI data center expansion.Super Micro Computer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Super Micro Computer, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Super Micro Computer, Inc. QuoteAnother key factor supporting the segment’s momentum is Super Micro Computer’s early availability of systems built on NVIDIA’s new Blackwell GPU architecture, alongside continued strength in Hopper-based systems. The expansion of the company’s Datacenter Building Block Solutions, which offers customers a one-stop integrated solution for servers, storage, networking and cooling, is expected to have further boosted adoption among enterprises and hyperscalers during the to-be-reported quarter.Leadership in DLC technology has also been a powerful competitive advantage for Super Micro Computer.

Stock buybacks present solid trade-war tradeoff,1744372800000,"Buying the dip is a good idea for at least one set of investors: CFOs. Chipmaker Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO unveiled a $10 billion share buyback plan, in a move that helps buffer valuations suffering even after Wednesday’s tariffs-rollback rally. Unlike many stock repurchases that tend to occur when prices are rising, doing so now would be a shrewd use of corporate capital to buck market trends.Broadcom’s program sends a signal that boss Hock Tan has unwavering confidence in a strategy to dominate the customized artificial intelligence semiconductor market for customers such as Google and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META . He has done this before, in 2021 and 2023, while simultaneously financing the $61 billion VMware acquisition. The results speak for themselves: after falling 37% to start 2025, the company’s stock price has jumped 14% since Monday’s announcement. It is also up 550% over five years.The math is sometimes simple. When shares trade below their intrinsic value, buybacks deliver quick returns. Reducing the number outstanding lifts per-share metrics, offering sellers immediate cash for a bigger piece of future profits. When funding big projects or M&A carries more risk, as it does now amid erratic tariff policy, acquiring discounted shares is the better option. Even Warren Buffett endorses the idea, saying there’s no better investment than your own business at a bargain.Too many executives, however, are less judicious than the Oracle of Omaha with their buybacks. Photoshop developer Adobe NASDAQ:ADBE , for example, authorized a $25 billion plan last March after its acquisition of rival Figma collapsed. The shares, at $550 apiece then, now trade around $360. United Airlines NASDAQ:UAL , Lululemon Athletica NASDAQ:LULU and Coty NYSE:COTY are among the others with bad timing in recent years.S&P 500 Index SP:SPX members spent a record $940 billion on stock repurchases last year, shattering the $800 billion mark from 2023, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Activity is up slightly in 2025; first quarter earnings will offer more clarity. Some CEOs may be short on cash while others will be inclined to hoard it with chances of recession growing. For the ones ready to reassure shareholders and capitalize on valuation markdowns, there are plenty of opportunities to back themselves.Follow @sptruestories on XCONTEXT NEWSBroadcom on April 7 unveiled a plan to buy back as much as $10 billion of its own shares through the end of the year. The chipmaker’s stock price gained 14% following the announcement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3QO0XT:0-stock-buybacks-present-solid-trade-war-tradeoff/"

Quality Growth Stocks Make Sense for an Uncertain Economy — Barrons.com,1747164480000,"By Jacob SonenshineThis time is a little different.When the market rallies, investors usually want to own the riskiest stocks. But right now, the winning formula has changed: The best names to buy are good-quality companies that also have high potential for growth.The S&P 500 is up 17% from the low point it hit in its nasty decline in April. Areas that lost the most when expectations about the economy soured have led the way, rebounding faster as the picture has brightened. The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce sky-high tariffs that were choking off trade between the countries, and the White House has indicated that deals with other countries are on the way.That would mean reduced tariffs, less inflation, and more spending by consumers and businesses.At this point, investors looking for stocks to buy at today's prices should avoid economically sensitive, riskier industries such as retail, restaurants, or financials. They are now a hair above their levels just before President Donald Trump unveiled surprisingly high tariffs against a wide range of countries in early April, meaning they are no longer reflecting much potential economic weakness.Yet harder times are still a possibility. While Trump has partially rolled back tariffs, a 10% baseline tariff rate remains in place. Interest rates, all the while, have remained around 4%, where they have now hovered across various maturities for a few years . High rates take time to push consumer spending down, so that is a continuing source of pressure on consumers.Economic growth is more likely to slow down than to significantly accelerate.Given all that, strategists at UBS screened for higher-quality companies that can increase their earnings regardless, reasoning those stocks are likely to perform best as the economy adjusts to President Donald Trump's trade war.The bank looked for companies with four qualities. They had to have a market capitalization of at least $10 billion, higher expected earnings growth than most publicly traded companies, and trade at forward price/earnings multiples closer to their historical averages than most stocks. Finally, companies had to be of higher ""operational quality"" than most businesses.The latter means they have characteristics that enable them to consistently increase earnings. Those include pricing power — the ability to lift prices without damaging demand — and high profit margins, which insulate a company from losing money during recessions.Stocks that make the cut can be expected to offer growth at a reasonable price, or GARP. UBS's screen yielded six names: Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company; Broadcom; Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks; Cintas, which supplies uniforms and cleaning supplies to businesses; Heico, the dominant maker of aircraft parts; and Salesforce, the provider of cloud-based sales software.Analysts expect sales at Salesforce to rise by just over 9% annually to $49.1 billion by 2027, according to FactSet. If the economy stumbles, some customers may scale back their investments in new cloud-based technologies as they watch their budgets, but any cuts are likely to be mild. Companies need the newest, fastest, and most cost efficient technologies to make the most of sales opportunities.That is where Salesforce comes in. Its artificial intelligence agents give customers a reason to pay higher subscription prices for its software products, so its revenue growth is higher than for the average S&P 500 company.If the company remains disciplined with costs, that would help profit margins increase, sending earnings per share up about 13% annually over the coming three years, according to FactSet. That compares with the 11% in growth in the aggregate earnings expected for companies in the S&P 500.That kind of profit growth would likely push the stock higher because its price/earnings ratio isn't likely to drop much from its current level. Salesforce trades at about 25 times the earnings per share expected for the coming 12 months, about 14 points below its five-year average of about 39 times. The S&P 500 sells for 21 times, compared with the five-year average of 20 times.Buy GARP stocks. They are just a better deal than the ones that are, well, the riskiest.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Is Lam Research Stock a Buy Post Upbeat Q3 Earnings Performance?,1745866800000,"Lam Research Corporation LRCX recently posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, helping its shares rise 7% since the April 23 release. Lam Research, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, reported solid financials, surpassing market expectations and reaffirming its position in the industry amid ongoing fluctuations in the semiconductor cycle.The stock has declined 1.1% year to date (YTD) in a highly volatile 2025 market scenario, with positive momentum post earnings showing signs of stability and an attractive valuation relative to its industry peers. Nonetheless, LRCX has outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as key semiconductor peers such as Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL in the YTD period.YTD Price Return PerformanceFor investors considering their next move, here’s why buying Lam Research stock might be the most prudent approach now.Q3 Results Show Lam Research’s Financial ResilienceLam Research’s third-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, showcasing the company’s solid financial foundation. Total revenues reached $4.72 billion, a 24.5% increase year over year, underpinned by continued demand across the memory and logic segments. Despite a challenging backdrop for the semiconductor industry, Lam Research managed a non-GAAP EPS of $1.04, exceeding analyst forecasts and improving 33.5% from the year-ago quarter (adjusted for the stock split).Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation QuoteThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s third-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability even amid fluctuating end-market demand.Datacenter and AI Chip Demand to Fuel Growth for LRCXLam Research is benefiting from the booming demand for AI and datacenter chips, which require advanced fabrication technologies. The company’s deposition and etch solutions are critical for producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging technologies, which are essential for AI workloads.In 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion by 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents further growth opportunities for Lam’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.With AI-driven investments accelerating, Lam’s leading position in etch and deposition makes it a key beneficiary of the next semiconductor spending cycle.Strategic Investments Aid Lam Research’s ProspectsLam Research’s continued investment in research & development and product innovation is paying off. The company’s Cryo 3.0 technology is setting new performance benchmarks for high-aspect-ratio dielectric etch applications, giving Lam a technological edge in next-gen semiconductor manufacturing.Additionally, Lam Research’s Aether dry-resist solution has been selected by multiple customers, including a leading memory manufacturer for high-bandwidth DRAM production. This underscores Lam Research’s growing influence in the memory fabrication market, particularly as HBM demand soars due to AI and HPC growth.Moreover, Lam has expanded its manufacturing footprint in Asia, improving cost efficiencies and responsiveness to customer demand. These strategic moves allowed Lam to achieve a 160-basis point expansion in operating margins in 2024 despite broader industry challenges. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the non-GAAP operating margin improved 210 basis points year over year to 32.8%.NAND Recovery to Drive Lam Research’s GrowthLam Research is also positioned to benefit from the rebounding NAND flash market. After a prolonged downturn, NAND spending is showing early signs of recovery.Although industry-wide NAND investments are still focused on technology upgrades rather than capacity expansion, Lam Research’s molybdenum (Moly) and carbon gap fill solutions are gaining traction. Management expects these technologies to drive hundreds of millions of dollars in NAND-related revenues in 2025.The ongoing transition to higher-layer count technology (above 200-layer counts) by NAND manufacturers bodes well for Lam Research’s revenue trajectory in the coming years.Valuation: Lam Research is UndervaluedLam Research’s valuation remains reasonable. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1, which is significantly lower than the sector’s 23.43. The company’s discounted valuation multiple aligns with its long-term growth potential.The stock’s P/E ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including Broadcom, NVIDIA and Marvell Technology. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Marvell Technology have forward 12-month P/E multiples of 26.68X, 24.71X and 20.03X, respectively.Conclusion: Buy LRCX Right NowLam Research’s discounted valuation, solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling investment option right now. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.LRCX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

NYSE:NET , the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application.AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.Palo Alto Networks® NASDAQ:PANW , the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations.Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete.

Nvidia Stock Falls. This Huawei Breakthrough Won't Help. — Barrons.com,1745850540000,"By Adam ClarkNvidia stock was dropping Monday as the company prepares for a new challenge in the artificial-intelligence chip sector from China's Huawei Technologies.Nvidia shares were down 2% at $108.84 in morning trading, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The stock rose 4.3% in Friday's session.Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing a new chip, called the Ascend 910D, which it hopes will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia's H100 was released in 2022 and has since been superseded by later generations of its Hopper chips and its new Blackwell AI semiconductors.Nvidia is prohibited from selling its most powerful AI chips to Chinese companies. Huawei is already poised to ship more than 800,000 of its Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers including state-owned telecommunications carriers and private AI developers, such as TikTok's parent ByteDance, according to the Journal.Nvidia's market in China was already set to shrink after the Trump administration said it would impose license requirements on future sales of its H20 AI accelerators, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. sanctions on Chinese AI exports. In fiscal 2025, 13% of Nvidia's sales were from billing addresses in China, down from 26% in fiscal 2022.Outside of China, the challenge from Huawei could be limited as it continues to lag behind Nvidia's latest technology.""The only real threat that I see to Nvidia here is in China where the state's control over the private sector may ensure a switch away from Nvidia's CUDA [software] with developers learning how to use Huawei's development platforms instead,"" wrote Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who publishes Radio Free Mobile.One potential piece of good news for Nvidia is that one of its largest U.S. customers, Elon Musk's xAI, is seeking to raise $20 billion in funding, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. The AI start-up didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Monday.Plenty of that money could be spent on Nvidia's hardware if the reported funding takes place, as xAI has invested in hundreds of thousands of the company's chips to run its AI data centers.Nvidia also said Monday that the first of software-and-cloud computing company Oracle's liquid-cooled GB200 NVL72 racks, which stitch together dozens of Nvidia's chips, were ready for use by customers.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was up 0.1% and Broadcom was down 1.2% in morning trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Docusign Benefits From eSignature Demand, Low Liquidity Ails",1744291560000,"Docusign, Inc. DOCU stock has gained 32.1% in a year against the industry and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s decline of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively.Docusign reported impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. DOCU’s EPS (excluding 47 cents from non-recurring items) was 86 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4% and increased 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Total revenues of $776.3 million beat the consensus mark by 2.1% and rose 9% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.How is Docusign Faring?Docusign’s top line significantly benefits from continued customer demand for eSignature in a large addressable market. DOCU’s customer base has grown from 1.3 million in fiscal 2023 to 1.5 million in fiscal 2024 and then to 1.7 million in fiscal 2025. This trend leads us to believe that the growth can be sustained in the future as well.Despite this rising demand, the market for eSignatures remains largely untapped. The global e-signature platform market size was $5.2 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $18.6 billion by 2029. In this expansive market, Adobe Acrobat Sign is the major competitor to DOCU’s eSignature, leaving a significant market share for the latter to address. Hence, the company is exposed to sufficient opportunities to expand eSignature across businesses globally, which will boost its top line.Over the past three years, subscription fees have contributed to 97% of DOCU’s top line on average. The company’s subscription plans generally range from one year to three years and the fees include the use of its products and access to customer support. A subscription model is very useful for software developers because it creates a recurring revenue stream and improves the visibility of cash flows.Furthermore, it also makes expensive software affordable and accessible to companies with limitations on resources, thus expanding the market. DOCU’s direct and indirect go-to-market initiatives also facilitated growth with commercial and enterprise customers. Multiple customer programs and initiatives and an expanded customers have gradually increased subscription revenue growth over time. The 7.8% growth in subscription revenues in fiscal 2025 is a testament to the company’s successful endeavour at winning and retaining customers.Docusign has strengthened its relationships with tech giants such as Salesforce and Microsoft. The company has expanded its global strategic partnership with Salesforce. Docusign and Salesforce partnered to develop solutions for the automation of the contract creation process and the expansion of collaboration among organizations that use the latter’s Slack. With Microsoft Teams, DOCU has made an eSignature integration and become the official electronic signature provider in the former’s Approvals app. Partnerships enable Docusign to tap into more accounts than it could individually.However, Docusign’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 0.81 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, down from the industry’s 2.54 and the year-ago quarter's 0.94. A declining current ratio due to a decrease in cash does not sit well for the company’s liquidity position. Furthermore, a current ratio of less than 1 indicates that the company does not have the resources to cover its short-term obligations.Docusign has never declared and currently does not intend to pay out cash dividends. So, the only way to achieve a return on investment on the stock is price appreciation, which is not guaranteed. Hence, investors seeking cash dividends should avoid buying DocuSign’s shares.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDOCU has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector are Broadcom Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors Shaping the Upcoming ResultsWith the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, Qualcomm is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets, driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. The company intends to harness artificial intelligence (AI) to meet increased demands for essential products and services that are the building blocks of digital transformation in a cloud economy. Qualcomm envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio.During the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI (artificial intelligence) desktops and laptops. This SoC (system-on-chip) is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Based on a 4-nanometer process, the Snapdragon X chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs – Microsoft Corporation ’s MSFT vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware. In the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm announced that Samsung, one of the major smartphone manufacturers in the world, deployed the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for its S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra devices. The advanced chip features the Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 Mobile Connectivity system and the Snapdragon X80 5G Modem-RF System, which ensure blazing fast 5G and WiFi 7 speeds. Qualcomm also extended its Snapdragon G Series portfolio with the addition of next-generation gaming chipsets. The 2025 product lineup includes Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chips. These initiatives are likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.Price PerformanceOver the past year, Qualcomm has lost 12.2% against the industry’s growth of 9.1%, lagging peers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO. While Broadcom has gained 43.6%, Hewlett Packard declined 5.5% over this period.Key Valuation MetricFrom a valuation standpoint, Qualcomm appears to be relatively cheaper compared to the industry and below its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 12.09 forward earnings, lower than 24.06 for the industry and the stock’s mean of 17.35. Investment ConsiderationsQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, the chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches. It is likely to help users experience a seamless transition to superfast 5G networks, delivering low-power, resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with unprecedented range and Qualcomm's best-in-class security. This, in turn, offers the flexibility and scalability needed for broad and fast 5G adoption through accelerated commercialization by OEMs. The company is reportedly the only chipset vendor with 5G system-level solutions spanning both sub-6 and millimeter wave bands and one of the largest RF (radio frequency) front-end suppliers with design wins across all premium-tier smartphone customers. Leveraging the technology roadmap for a focused approach to innovation, it aims to connect millions of devices to the ‘connected intelligent edge.’ In addition, solid growth opportunities within the mobile space led by innovations in the Snapdragon portfolio for premium-tier Android handsets and a firmer footing in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology with the Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems portfolio are tailwinds.End NoteWith solid fundamentals and healthy revenue-generating potential driven by robust demand trends, Qualcomm appears to be a solid investment proposition. It also looks cheaper relative to the industry. Further, a strong emphasis on quality, diligent execution of operational plans and continuous portfolio enhancements are driving more value for customers. With improving earnings estimates, the stock is witnessing a positive investor perception.Riding on a robust earnings surprise history and favorable Zacks Rank, it appears primed to record solid quarterly earnings. Hence, investors are likely to profit if they bet on this high-flying stock now.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:661c393a9094b:0-pre-q2-earnings-is-qcom-stock-a-portfolio-must-have/
Broadcom's Big Outperformance Shows Strength Amid Tariff Decline,1744290540000,"Amid all of the tariff-related volatility in the market,  semiconductor leader Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO has fared better than many. Since Trump’s tariff announcement hit markets on Apr. 3, shares of Broadcom are up nearly 8% as of the Apr. 9 close.This performance is impressive, considering the S&P 500 Index is down nearly 3% over that period. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ:SOXQ is down 2%. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] However, Broadcom dropped over 10% on Apr. 3 in reaction to the Liberation Day announcement.It dropped another 5% the next day as the Chinese announced reciprocal tariffs. Thus, markets clearly feel Broadcom has some tariff risk.This comes even though Trump excluded semiconductors from his tariffs. The analysis below will break down Broadcom’s tariff exposure in two ways: direct and indirect exposure.It will also examine why the stock has performed comparatively well.Direct Tariff Implications: Semiconductor Exemption Provides RespiteOverall, because semiconductors are exempt from the tariffs, Broadcom’s direct exposure is somewhat minimal. However, tariffs on semiconductors could be coming. President Trump recently said that tariffs on chips will come “very soon”. This would create a significant effect on Broadcom’s business. In 2024, 20% of the firm’s total revenues came from China. Tariffs on these goods would hamper demand in the country.However, at the moment, the direct impact of tariffs on Broadcom isn’t the main concern, especially with Trump softening his stance. He announced that countries that don’t enact retaliatory tariffs will be exempt from the latest U.S. tariffs. This sent the market—and Broadcom shares—soaring. It signals that Trump isn’t drawing a hard line in the sand and could ease his aggressive tariff policies. It also suggests he may walk back the idea of implementing chip tariffs.Notably, tariffs haven’t been a big topic of conversation at Broadcom’s meetings with analysts. Since Aug. 2024, participants in the firm’s five earnings or conference calls have used the word “tariffs” a total of just three times.Indirect Tariff Implications: Broadcom’s Bigger ProblemThe indirect impact of tariffs is likely to be much more impactful on Broadcom. Imported products that contain Broadcom’s chips are subject to tariffs. The vast majority of chip manufacturing takes place in Asia, meaning that final products shipped to the U.S. will face higher costs. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] These higher costs will degrade demand for these products and thus the Broadcom chips inside them. This could affect both Broadcom’s AI chip and non-AI chip businesses. Both made up just under 28% of revenue last quarter.Within non-AI chips, Broadcom has large exposure to Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , which uses its chips in its consumer devices. With tariffs expected to impact Apple sales and profits, Broadcom will likely also take a hit.Broadcom’s AI servers could also be significantly impacted by Asian manufacturing. Reports indicate that, in general, 60% of AI servers are made in Mexico,  and 30% come from Taiwan. Stacy Ragson of Bernstein Research does not expect the tariffs to affect those servers made in Mexico.If Broadcom’s AI server manufacturing is similar to these figures, it could avoid a significant amount of tariffs on its AI business. It is important to note that the locations of companies making these servers for Broadcom are unknown. Actual figures could be significantly different.Why Broadcom Has Performed Relatively Well in Bad Market ConditionsOne likely reason that Broadcom shares have held up relatively well is that its AI customers are hyperscalers. These companies are cash-rich and view AI as massively important to their long-term goals. This means a big chunk of Broadcom’s sales has a chance to remain largely intact as these firms prioritize spending on AI.Additionally, infrastructure software made up 45% of the firm’s revenue last quarter. This isn’t affected by current tariffs. However, companies could cut back on spending here to make up for higher costs in other areas.Another factor that has been a boon to Broadcom shares is a big announcement it recently made. Broadcom announced a $10 billion share buyback program after the market close on Apr. 7, a sign of Broadcom’s continued confidence in its business and ability to generate cash despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment ahead.Overall, there is reason to believe that Broadcom has moderate insulation from tariffs. However, if tariffs lead to a recession, this would certainly be bad for business. It will be very interesting to see what management has to say about tariffs going forward.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:09cd3a461094b:0-broadcom-s-big-outperformance-shows-strength-amid-tariff-decline/
"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia. ""Everything needs an accelerator,"" they wrote. Meanwhile, the stock's price-to-earnings multiple is near a five-year low, they said.-Britney NguyenThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Broadcom's VMware Deal Lifts AVGO Despite Complaints,1745838240000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom’s NASDAQ:AVGO acquisition of VMware has been a massive success . Broadcom has made many significant changes to extract value and improve VMware from a financial standpoint. So far, the changes have brought huge benefits to Broadcom.The semiconductor company reported revenue growth in its software segment of 47% last quarter, primarily due to VMware. Broadcom has also massively increased the profitability of VMware. In Aug. 2023, just before the acquisition, VMware had an adjusted operating margin of just under 29%. At the end of 2024, Broadcom’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said this figure hit 70% .Clearly, VMware has recently been a massive win for Broadcom. However, the changes Broadcom has implemented have left many customers incensed. The firm may be playing with fire long-term.The analysis below will detail Broadcom's changes to VMware to drive its success. It will also highlight the risks that Broadcom is taking on. Overall, Broadcom’s VMware strategy can continue adding significant value for the foreseeable future.Customers are Fighting Mad with Broadcom’s VMware ChangesBroadcom has made changes to VMware that are vast. It has cut the number of VMware employees approximately in half. It has also lowered the number of different packages offered from 8,000 to just four. However, the most impactful move has likely been the effort to switch customers to a subscription license rather than a perpetual one.This has caused many customers to see the price of their VMware service skyrocket. Price increases of 150% to 300% are on the lower end of the spectrum.Understandably, many are very unhappy with these changes. The fact that AT&T NYSE:T sued Broadcom in 2024 highlights this. It alleged that Broadcom didn’t honor the contract AT&T had with VMware prior to the acquisition. AT&T also said Broadcom quoted it a price increase of 1,050%.The companies have settled the lawsuit, but it epitomizes the sentiment of many customers regarding the VMware changes. Overall, this has resulted in many customers considering leaving VMware. One report suggests that nearly 52% of customers are mulling a breakup.The VMware changes have added great value to Broadcom. However, investors cannot ignore the real risk of losing many customers. However, considering leaving and actually doing so are two very different things. Evidence suggests that Broadcom might not be overplaying its hand, although customers are unhappy.VMware’s Stickiness Means Leaving Could Cause More Pain Than Benefit [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom’s ability to push these huge price increases comes from VMware’s dominance and the huge drawbacks of switching to another provider. Scott Bickley of Info-Tech Research Group suggests that at least 80% of enterprises use some form of VMware.This ubiquitous adoption creates a large ecosystem of skilled talent and partners that know VMware well. This reinforces its usage and makes it difficult to switch to alternatives. Bickley explains that VMware creates a “super-glue-style lock-in.” To switch from VMware, companies need to rework their whole tech environment. He also notes that VMware alternatives lack the same level of functionality.A study from Gartner looked at how long it would take to perform a VMware migration. It estimated a period of 18 to 48 months for a large enterprise to do so. Not only would this take a massive amount of time, but there could also be disruptions in operations while making the change.Overall, Gartner estimates that a migration from VMware could cost a large enterprise more than $6 million. This doesn’t sound like a massive sum to a large company. However, this figure doesn’t include the fact that a company must continue paying Broadcom while it does its migration.It could take a significant amount of time before overall costs start to come down. A.J. Thompson of the IT consultancy firm Northdoor says that he has seen few companies that are willing to take on the pain of migrating from VMware.Broadcom’s VMware Strategy Can Continue to Add ValueOverall, although customers are not pleased with Broadcom, it seems that the company understands its power. At this point, Broadcom’s VMware strategy seems likely to continue benefiting the stock for years to come. This is further bolstered by the sheer amount of time it would take for customers to leave VMware.If Broadcom noticed a sea of customers attempting to leave, it could likely adjust its strategy in time to stave this off.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:86041dd87094b:0-broadcom-s-vmware-deal-lifts-avgo-despite-complaints/
Sector Update: Tech Stocks Gain Late Afternoon,1747079649000,"Tech stocks surged late Monday afternoon with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) climbing 4.3% and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD) soaring 7.5%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumped 6.4%. Semiconductor stocks rose after the US and China agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other's goods. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA gained 5.3%, and Qualcomm NASDAQ:QCOM , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD and Marvell Technology NASDAQ:MRVL advanced. In corporate news, Apple NASDAQ:AAPL is planning to use a battery management mode powered by artificial intelligence for iOS 19, an iPhone software update due in September, Bloomberg reported. Separately, the company is evaluating higher prices for its next iPhone lineup, the Wall Street Journal reported. Apple shares rose 6%. Scale AI, which counts Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN among its investors, plans to establish a presence in Saudi Arabia by year-end as part of its expansion in the Middle East, Bloomberg News reported.

Time to Buy Broadcom (AVGO) Stock as Markets Rip Higher,1744240200000,"Added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on Wednesday, Broadcom's AVGO stock is standing out as markets ripped higher on news that President Trump will temporarily rescind reciprocal tariffs on many countries outside of China.Broadcom shares soared +18% in today’s trading session, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted gains of +9% and +12% respectively. The leading chipmaker is benefitting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, suggesting now may be an ideal time to buy the dip in AVGO which is still down 20% year to date amid broader market volatility.Broadcom’s ASIC Dominance Continues As the second largest AI chip supplier behind Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom’s expansion is being fueled by its specialization in application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) which are designed to perform specific tasks rather than general-purpose computing. To that point, Broadcom is thought to control up to 60% of the market share for ASIC chips.Furthermore, Broadcom’s concentration on AI processors is leading to significant revenue streams as hyper-scale clients such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet GOOGL build out their data centers for AI-specific applications and technology. What should lead to more optimism and higher investor sentiment is that Broadcom is also collaborating with Apple AAPL as the iPhone maker is developing its first server processor for AI applications.Tracking Broadcom’s Outlook Based on Zacks estimates, Broadcom’s total sales are expected to increase by 21% in fiscal 2025 to $62.39 billion compared to $51.57 billion last year. More intriguing, FY26 sales are projected to spike another 16% to $72.3 billion.On the bottom line, annual earnings are currently slated to soar 35% this year to $6.60 per share from EPS of $4.87 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is forecasted to increase another 19% to $7.84.Suggesting the rally in AVGO could have legs is that FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are nicely up in the last month and have now risen 4% and 5% over the last 60 days respectively.AVGO Historical Performance & Valuation Despite the YTD drop in AVGO, Broadcom stock is sitting on +200% gains over the last three years and has skyrocketed over +1,300% in the last decade to impressively outperform the broader indexes and its Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors Market’s +311%.Making this year’s pullback more appealing is that AVGO is now trading at 23.6X forward earnings, which is near its industry average and the benchmark S&P 500’s 18.8X. It’s also noteworthy that AVGO is trading at a significant discount to its decade-long high of 47.9X forward earnings and closer to the median of 17.1X during this period.Bottom Line With positive earnings estimate revisions suggesting the rally in Broadcom’s stock could continue, it may be advantageous to get in on the company’s stellar growth as the ASIC chip market is thought to be valued at upward of $20 billion and is rapidly expanding. Notably, the Average Zacks Price Target of $249.25 a share still suggests 34% upside for AVGO following today’s rally.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e687d8652094b:0-time-to-buy-broadcom-avgo-stock-as-markets-rip-higher/
"Corporate America boosts security spending after UnitedHealth murder, filings show",1745830800000,"U.S. corporations have been ramping up their security spending, but following the murder of UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson that expenditure is set to rise further in 2025 as more companies see heightened threats to their top brass.At least a dozen S&P 500 companies have flagged an increase in security risks, a Reuters analysis of the proxy statements - or annual disclosures to shareholders - showed.Blue-chip companies such as Walmart NYSE:WMT , General Motors NYSE:GM , American Express NYSE:AXP and chipmaker Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO have disclosed new or increased security expenses from previous years.""The number of customers requiring assessments and executive protection has increased 10 to 15 times the number prior to December 4,"" said Glen Kucera, president at security services firm Allied Universal, which serves more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies.UnitedHealth NYSE:UNH spent $1.7 million on security for its top executives in 2024, the first time it disclosed the detail in its proxy statement on April 21. Its insurance unit CEO, Thompson, was shot dead on December 4 in a targeted attack in New York that raised fears among executives over threats to their safety. UnitedHealth rival Elevance Health NYSE:ELV cited an ""enhanced security risk environment"" to raise security benefits, while Johnson & Johnson NYSE:JNJ , Eli Lilly NYSE:LLY , and pharmacy chain Walgreens NASDAQ:WBA reported additional expenses. Of the 208 S&P 500 companies that have filed their annual proxy statement for fiscal 2024, about 31.3% of them granted a security perk to at least one of their named executive officers, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm.That expense rose to a median of $94,276, up from $69,180 in 2023, based on disclosures from roughly a quarter of the companies. In 2022, when 23.1% of companies reported security spending, the median was $40,917, Equilar told Reuters.Because Thompson's murder took place late in the year, compensation experts said proxy statements for 2025 will likely show an even greater increase in security spending.""We anticipate that security-related costs and perquisites will likely increase in terms of the amount of imputed income that's disclosed in proxies but also the prevalence,"" said David Kokell, head of U.S. compensation research at Institutional Shareholder Services. TOP EXECUTIVE THREATCEOs and other prominent executives can become lightning rods for anger directed toward broader organizations, leading to more spending on security, even though it is still a small fraction of a company's annual business expenses.General Motors said increased security would be offered to CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss after a recent assessment. Broadcom spent $1.37 million on CEO Hock Tan's security in 2024 but did not give the number for prior years, while credit card giant American Express' spending on security perks more than doubled from 2023 and is expected to increase in 2025. Other companies that boosted protection include utility companies Edison International NYSE:EIX and CenterPoint Energy NYSE:CNP , as well as Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD .A vast majority of companies do not outline their security costs. Only 18% of S&P 500 and 5% of Russell 3000 companies disclosed personal and home security as a CEO compensation perquisite, according to 2024 data from The Conference Board. A full picture of the increase in spending will only emerge by September when more companies file their reports or next year, analysts said.Companies are also expanding the security cover to more executives and public events, experts said in the aftermath of Thompson's murder, which took place outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealth was holding an investor conference. The scope ""has actually expanded"", John Gainer, vice president at security firm TorchStone Global, said. ""It starts with the CEO, then the C-suite, and now increasingly includes the board—especially when it comes to public-facing events like board or shareholder meetings.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QS0E9:0-corporate-america-boosts-security-spending-after-unitedhealth-murder-filings-show/"

AMD vs. Broadcom: Which Semiconductor Stock Has Greater Upside?,1744225200000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Broadcom AVGO are key providers of semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence (AI). Chips from these companies support running of Large Language Models that form the backbone of Generative AI (Gen AI). Growing AI deployment bodes well for both AMD and AVGO. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expects double-digit growth rate in 2025 with semiconductor sales surging 19.1% to $627.6 billion in 2024. However, both AMD and Broadcom shares have suffered from tech sell-off year to date (YTD) amid rising fears of a recession following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on top trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada, which has increased the chances of a trade war. Semiconductor companies, including Broadcom and AMD, import key parts to international markets, which makes them vulnerable to a trade war.While AMD shares have lost 35.3% YTD, AVGO dropped 32.1%.AMD and AVGO Stock PerformanceSo, AMD or Broadcom, which is a better buy amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop? Let’s find out.AMD’s Strong Portfolio, Rich Partner Base Key CatalystAMD is gaining traction in the cloud-data center and AI chip markets with its portfolio of fifth-gen EPYC Turin, fourth-gen and third-gen EPYC processors as well as Instinct accelerators and ROCm software suite. AMD delivered more than $5 billion in data center AI revenues in 2024, driven by deployments of MI300X by Meta Platforms and Microsoft. EPYC instances increased 27% in 2024 to more than 1000, with hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent launching more than 100 general-purpose AI instances in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone. AMD Instinct accelerators saw strong demand from a dozen cloud service providers, including IBM and Digital Ocean, and the company expects this number to grow in 2025. AMD’s MI325X is currently under production. Its next-generation MI350 series, based on CDNA 4 architecture, promises a 35 times increase in AI compute performance compared with CDNA 3. The company plans to ship samples to lead customers in the current quarter and is on track to accelerate production shipments to mid-year. The development of the MI400 series is also progressing well, and it remains on track to launch in 2026.AMD has been on an acquisitive spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem with buyouts like ZT Systems, Helsinki-based Silo AI, Nod.ai and Mipsology.Broadcom Rides on Strong Demand for XPUsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of its kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment at hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, AMD’s SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc.

Nvidia Stock Rises. What Alphabet and Intel Earnings Mean for the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1745592180000,"By Adam Clark and Tae KimNvidia was climbing early Friday as the market digested earnings reports from Alphabet and rival chip maker Intel.Strong demand for artificial intelligence technology looks to bode well for the leading AI semiconductor company.Nvidia shares were up 1.2% at $107.70 in early trading Friday. The stock rose 3.6% on Thursday.Alphabet earnings on Thursday were being closely watched for any signs of a slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure. Nvidia investors should be reassured by the company holding its outlook for capital expenditure this year at $75 billion.Alphabet executives said they finished the quarter with more demand for cloud-computing services than the company had capacity to serve. They reiterated that Alphabet has a ""strong relationship"" with Nvidia, even as it continues to improve its own in-house AI chips.Meanwhile, the prospect of serious competition in AI chips from Intel still seems remote. While new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company will aim to build ""full stack AI solutions"" — spanning hardware, software and services — of the type that Nvidia already offers, he didn't put a timeline on when it might bring a competitive AI processor to the market.In January, Intel announced it wouldn't bring its next AI data center product Falcon Shores to market. Instead, it said it would focus its efforts on developing another product called Jaguar Shores.""We still have a Jaguar Shores product on our road map...We know that is a segment of the data center market that we're not competing in today, and we need a robust portfolio as all the customers are looking for alternatives,"" said Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel's Product business, on a call with analysts on Thursday.On Friday, Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst Joseph Moore also dismissed concerns that demand for AI chips is weakening. ""The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand,"" he wrote.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom both fell 0.5% in early trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Chips, AI Stocks Jump on Tariff Pause",1744222680000,"By Katherine HamiltonSome of the biggest technology stocks spiked after President Trump said there would be a 90-day pause on tariffs, relieving fears about semiconductor chips and artificial intelligence.Apple and Nvidia gained 12% and 13%, respectively, to $192.43 and $109.15. Microsoft rose 8% to $383.82. Hewlett Packard climbed 7.9% to $23.61 and Intel jumped 16% to $21.06. Broadcom and Qualcomm were up 14% and 12%, respectively.Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Wednesday that there would be a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except for China, on which he is imposing a 125% tariff.Trump's tariff campaign wasn't set to directly affect semiconductors imported into the U.S., but China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports of products with chips in them could lead to higher prices on those electronics and weaken demand for them.Chip companies had fallen after President Trump said last week he was imposing tariffs of 32% on Taiwan and 34% on China.There were also concerns tariffs would slow down AI growth, given higher anticipated costs for many of the products used in data centers.Write to Katherine Hamilton at katherine.hamilton@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250409008543:0-chips-ai-stocks-jump-on-tariff-pause/

AVGO and Primoris Services PRIM.2 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks That Boast Solid Growth PotentialWall Street has been exhibiting wild swings, driven by growing uncertainty around the new U.S. administration’s economic tariffs. These tariffs are expected to drive up consumer prices, thus curbing spending and weighing on the U.S. economy. In such a scenario, investors have become defensive and shifted their focus to products that provide stability and safety in a rocky market. As a result, the appeal for dividend stocks has risen.Though these stocks do not offer dramatic price appreciation, they tend to outperform in a choppy market and can reduce the volatility of a portfolio. In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Two stocks — Broadcom Inc. and Primoris Services — seem solid choices in this regard.Here are two of the three stocks that fit the bill:California-based Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices focused on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

2 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks That Boast Solid Growth Potential,1745501640000,"Wall Street has been exhibiting wild swings, driven by growing uncertainty around the new U.S. administration’s economic tariffs. These tariffs are expected to drive up consumer prices, thus curbing spending and weighing on the U.S. economy. In such a scenario, investors have become defensive and shifted their focus to products that provide stability and safety in a rocky market. As a result, the appeal for dividend stocks has risen. Though these stocks do not offer dramatic price appreciation, they tend to outperform in a choppy market and can reduce the volatility of a portfolio. In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Two stocks — Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Primoris Services PRIM — seem solid choices in this regard.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. A history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth Greater Than Zero : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth Greater Than Zero : This represents stocks with a strong record of revenue growth.5-Year Historical EPS Growth Greater Than Zero : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate Greater Than Zero : This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow Less Than M-Industry : A ratio less than M-industry indicates that a stock is undervalued in that industry, and an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by a company.52-Week Price Change Greater Than S&P 500 (Market Weight) : This ensures that a stock has appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank : Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in every market environment.Growth Score of B or Better : Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.These few criteria have narrowed down the universe from more than 7,700 stocks to just 3.Here are two of the three stocks that fit the bill:California-based Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices focused on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products. The stock saw positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents for the fiscal year (ending October 2025) over the past 30 days and has an expected earnings growth rate of 35.5%. Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.

Micron vs. Broadcom: Which Stock is the Smarter Semiconductor Bet?,1747058760000,"Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO are both entrenched in high-growth semiconductor arenas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and cloud infrastructure, but they take radically different paths to capture value. Micron is a dominant memory chip maker, while Broadcom specializes in networking, custom silicon and infrastructure software.Both companies have seen share price fluctuations in 2025 amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While MU shares have risen 2% year to date, AVGO dropped 10.2%. Yet with AI adoption accelerating, which stock stands out as the smarter semiconductor investment today? Let’s find out.Micron: AI Memory Boom Aids, Margin Worries LingerMicron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, Micron revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Despite Micron's efforts to capitalize on rising AI-related demand, margin pressures and pricing challenges raise red flags. While Micron’s top-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was impressive, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Broadcom: Profitable, Predictable and Primed for AIMeanwhile, Broadcom offers investors a more diversified and durable growth profile. The company is deeply embedded in next-generation AI infrastructure through its custom application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) and high-performance networking chips, which are fueling its top-line growth.Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require a complex integration of compute, memory and I/O capabilities to achieve the essential performance at lower power consumption and costs. Broadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion.What’s more impressive is that Broadcom is already sampling the world’s first 3nm XPU chips and plans to launch a 2nm version using advanced 3.5D packaging later this year. The company targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. It believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric.Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Super Micro Computer, has been a key catalyst.From a financial perspective, Broadcom consistently delivers gross margins above 70% and operating margins above 60%, driven by its high-value custom silicon business and enterprise software portfolio. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP EPS soared 45.5% on 25% higher revenues. Looking forward, Broadcom expects total revenues in the second quarter to surge 19% year over year to $14.9 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: MU Picks Up Steam, AVGO Holds SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Micron’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 41% and 433%, respectively. However, the estimate revision trend for MU’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS has remained highly volatile.Micron EPS Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 21% and 36%, respectively. However, unlike Micron, estimates for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS have demonstrated a steady upward revision trend. This stability is a testament to the company’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.Broadcom EPS Estimate Revision TrendValuation: MU is Cheaper, but AVGO Deserves the PremiumMicron is trading at a forward sales multiple of 2.24X, way below Broadcom’s 14.48X.Broadcom does seem pricey compared to Micron. However, AVGO’s higher valuation is backed by superior profitability and a structurally more diversified business. The company boasts steady gross and operating margins compared to MU’s more variable margin profile.Micron’s falling profitability raises questions about its ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Conclusion: Broadcom is the Better Long-Term PlayBoth Micron and Broadcom are riding the same megatrends — AI, cloud and data centers — but they’re doing so from vastly different positions of strength.Micron has upside potential due to its leadership in AI memory. However, that promise is being weighed down by margin pressure and pricing volatility. It’s still a play on memory cycles more than a structural AI winner.Meanwhile, Broadcom brings more stability to the table with strong fundamentals, durable earnings, and a balanced mix of AI-driven hardware and enterprise software. While its valuation is higher, it’s supported by margin strength and earnings consistency.So, for investors seeking a smarter semiconductor bet amid global uncertainty, Broadcom remains the more compelling choice.Currently, AVGO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared to MU, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Semiconductor, Chip Stocks Rally on U.S.-China Trade Deal — Update",1747058640000,"By Dean Seal and Denny JacobShares of semiconductor and chip companies are moving higher after the U.S. and China agreed to dramatically scale back sky-high tariffs on each other's goods.Shares of Nvidia were up 3.9% at $121.15, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing shares rose 4.8% to $184.97. Shares of Qualcomm were up 3.6% at $150.36, while shares of Broadcom were up 4.9% at $218.45.The semiconductor sector has been under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war kicked off by the Trump administration this year. While President Trump didn't issue direct tariffs on chipmakers, most chips are exported to China or other countries where they are assembled into servers and computer equipment that were expected to face tariffs when shipped to the U.S.Chip companies saw similar gains in early trading Monday. Marvell Technology rose 6.4% to $63.48, while Micron Technology jumped 7.6% to $92.39. Advanced Micro Devices rose 5.7% to $108.67, while Super Micro Computer gained 7.9% to $34.52.After weekend talks in Geneva, the countries said Monday that Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariff on China would be slashed to 10% from 125% and that the reductions would last for 90 days while negotiations are ongoing.The agreement came faster than expected and eased tariff levels more than Wall Street had anticipated, sending U.S. stocks higher.Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250512006033:0-semiconductor-chip-stocks-rally-on-u-s-china-trade-deal-update/
Broadcom Stock Down 11% in a Month: Should You Buy the Dip?,1745434800000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have dropped 11.4% in the past month. The company has been suffering from the ongoing sell-off in technology stocks amid rising fears of a recession following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on top trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada, which has increased the chances of a trade war. Broadcom generated roughly 20% of net revenues from shipments to China (including Hong Kong) in fiscal 2024.However, we believe the dip offers a massive opportunity for investors to buy the stock. An innovative portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business and strong balance sheet, as well as free cash flow generating ability, are attractive for growth-oriented investors. Let’s dig deep to find out more.AVGO Stock Performance  Strong Portfolio to Boost Broadcom’s ProspectsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. AVGO’s innovative portfolio is a key catalyst. The company’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies DELL, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Growing Security Portfolio Aids AVGOBroadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.Last week, AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Meanwhile, Broadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 0.6% over the past 30 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

Chip Stocks Rally on U.S.-China Trade Deal,1747056960000,"By Dean SealShares of semiconductor companies are moving higher after the U.S. and China agreed to dramatically scale back sky-high tariffs on each other's goods.Shares of Nvidia were up 4.4% at $121.76 ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rose 5.9% to $186.89. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 7.8% to $110.84. Shares of Qualcomm were up 6.2% at $154.12. Shares of Broadcom were up 5.8% at $220.21.The semiconductor sector has been under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war kicked off by the Trump administration this year. While President Trump didn't issue direct tariffs on chipmakers, most chips are exported to China or other countries where they are assembled into servers and computer equipment that were expected to face tariffs when shipped to the U.S.After weekend talks in Geneva, the countries said Monday that Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariff on China would be slashed to 10% from 125% and that the reductions would last for 90 days while negotiations are ongoing.The agreement came faster than expected and eased tariff levels more than Wall Street had anticipated, sending U.S. stock futures higher. Tech-sector stocks are on track for early gains after the opening bell.Write to Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250512005716:0-chip-stocks-rally-on-u-s-china-trade-deal/

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Intel Plans to Slash More Than 20% of Workforce: Report. The Stock Is Rising. — Barrons.com,1745419020000,"By Adam ClarkIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has promised a radical shake-up of the beleaguered chip company and his latest move could be mass layoffs.The chip company plans to announce the reduction of more than 20% of its workforce this week, Bloomberg reported late Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Intel declined to comment.The reported cuts would affect around 22,000 workers, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 as at the end of 2024. Last year, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 employees.In midmorning trading, the stock was up 7.0% at $20.87. It has dropped 43% over the past 12 months.Tan was appointed CEO last month and is looking to prioritize its core chip design and chip-manufacturing businesses. While he was widely expected to implement substantial job cuts, theIntel's first-quarter earnings come on Thursday. It is expected to report a net loss of $987 million, according to FactSet; on an adjusted basis, the forecast is a $9 million profit.Intel executives said recently that the company had begun low-volume testing on its new 18A chip-manufacturing process, which it hopes will give it a technological lead against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.""We do see downside for Intel as somewhat limited with investors in our view more likely to focus on the potential for 1) a split of Intel's fab and design businesses (a result we see as unlikely for now), and 2) Intel's progress with 18A,"" wrote Wedbush analysts on Wednesday.The Wedbush team kept a Neutral rating on the stock but reduced its price target to $19 from $20.While producing Intel's own chips will provide some validation for its costly chip-manufacturing efforts, the real test will be whether it can attract significant external customers for the 18A process. Nvidia and Broadcom are running tests on the process, Reuters reported previously.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

A new threat has also emerged: President Trump's recent comments calling for 100% tariffs on films produced outside of the U.S.Disney shares jumped 11% Wednesday, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Berkshire HathawayThe Oracle of Omaha is retiring.At the conclusion of Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3, legendary investor Warren Buffett said he plans to step down as chief executive in December.Greg Abel, who has been on deck to succeed Buffett as CEO since 2021, will take the reins on Jan. 1. Buffett will remain the conglomerate's chairman.Buffett, who is 94, has led the company for the past 60 years. His retirement announcement surprised shareholders, as many thought that Buffett would remain CEO until his death.Berkshire shares lost 5.1% Monday.Ford MotorFord and Mattel joined the growing group of companies scrapping annual guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.Ford on Tuesday reported a steep decline in quarterly profit and suspended its annual guidance, saying it couldn't predict the full impact of President Trump's levies. The automaker said tariffs could cut $1.5 billion from a key measure of profit.Mattel also scrapped its annual forecast. The maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels said it could increase U.S. toy prices, as the company is bracing for a $270 million tariff hit. Mattel is also moving more of its production out of China.Ford shares rose 2.7% Tuesday, while Mattel gained 2.9%.Cleveland-CliffsAs President Trump seeks to build up American steel demand, one of the major U.S. steelmakers is shrinking.Cleveland-Cliffs on Wednesday said it would pause or slow operations at six plants after posting a wider first-quarter loss and lower revenue. The production cuts and changes in operations are expected to affect about 2,000 jobs and save the steelmaker $300 million a year.While steel prices climbed as customers bought up steel ahead of Trump's tariffs on imported metal, that rally has stalled. Now, buyers are holding off on placing big orders in an uncertain U.S. economy.Cleveland-Cliffs shares plummeted 16% Thursday.BroadcomU.S. chip stocks got a boost, thanks to the possibility of a reprieve from tight export controls.The Trump administration plans to overhaul controversial regulations that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips individual countries can buy, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.A White House spokeswoman said that the Commerce Department plans to replace the rule — commonly known as AI diffusion — which was set to go into effect May 15.The decision is a temporary boon for the tech titans, but many executives are still bracing for tight restrictions. The Trump administration recently cracked down on Nvidia selling a specialized AI chip to China, causing the company to take a $5.5 billion charge.Broadcom shares rose 1.5% Thursday.BoeingThe new U.S. trade deal with the U.K. includes some good news for Boeing.President Trump on Thursday announced that his administration and the U.K. had made a trade deal pact, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a British airline would buy $10 billion worth of Boeing planes.In exchange for the U.K. purchasing the jets and giving American farmers greater access to U.K. markets, the Trump administration agreed to roll back tariffs imposed on British steel and automobiles.

"Nvidia, AMD, and Other Chip Stocks Rally. Tariffs Fears Are Lifting — but There Is Another Concern to Watch. — Barrons.com",1745418780000,"By Adam ClarkNvidia stock jumped 4.4% early Wednesday amid a broader market rally after President Donald Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on China to reach a deal.The chip maker's shares were trading around $103.25 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Tuesday. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.7% and Broadcom was up 5.2% in morning trading. The iShares Semiconductor exchange-traded fund was up 5.7%.President Trump on Tuesday said U.S.-imposed tariffs of 145% on imported goods from China will come down ""substantially"" after the two sides negotiate a deal. The Nasdaq Composite was up 3.9%.While lower tariffs on China won't have much of a direct effect on Nvidia, which sources the majority of its chips from Taiwan, it could reduce fears over retaliation and the potential level of sector-specific levies on imported semiconductors. Trump has said additional tariffs on semiconductors are coming, and the administration has restricted Nvidia's chip sales in China. The administration also hasn't made clear how it intends to apply former President Joe Biden's so-called AI diffusion rules to control chip exports before they take effect on May 15.""In our view, the upcoming AI Diffusion Rule remains the biggest near-term risk, with our worst-case scenario assuming another 10% sales and up to 11% of EPS [earnings per share] shaved off from our new base case,"" wrote BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya in a research note.Arya kept a Buy rating on Nvidia stock, noting it is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of around 19 times its forecast profit for 2026.

Micron Stock Plunges 28% in a Month: Should You Hold or Exit?,1745412900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU shares have plunged 27.8% over the past month and underperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which is down 13.9%. MU stock has also underperformed major semiconductor players, including Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.MU One-Month Price Return PerformanceThis steep decline raises the question: Should investors cut their losses and exit, or is the stock worth holding onto? While the near-term headwinds are real, MU’s long-term growth story remains intact, making a strong case for holding the stock.Why Did Micron Struggle?The company’s recent slump is part of a larger tech pullback triggered by fears of an escalating tariff war and slowing economic growth. The situation is compounded by a growing concern over its deteriorating gross margin.In its latest financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9% from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning for the investors was the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This dim outlook indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist in the near term.Despite these challenges, Micron’s dominant market position and promising long-term outlook make it a stock worth holding onto.Micron’s Promising Long-Term OutlookWhile near-term profitability guidance is uninspiring, Micron’s long-term prospects are bright. Should the company hit its third-quarter targets, it would still reflect impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 427% for fiscal 2025 and 58% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMicron’s strategic position in the memory and storage chip market, a critical component for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, positions it to capitalize on an expected surge in AI-related capital expenditures over the coming years.Positive Industry Trends Aid Micron’s ProspectsMicron’s position in high-demand segments such as AI, data center, automotive and industrial IoT places it at the forefront of the semiconductor industry's evolution. The explosion of AI applications has significantly increased demand for advanced memory solutions, such as DRAM and NAND. Micron’s investments in cutting-edge DRAM and 3D NAND technologies ensure it remains competitive and poised to capitalize on these trends.Micron’s diversification strategy is noteworthy. By reducing reliance on consumer electronics, which are more susceptible to demand swings, and focusing on stable sectors like automotive and data centers, Micron mitigates revenue volatility. This balance reinforces its resilience in an industry often impacted by cyclical trends.Additionally, Micron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, MU revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Valuation: Micron is UndervaluedValuation-wise, Micron is undervalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of B.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 1.86X, significantly lower than the sector’s 5.06X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 11.88X, 11.79X and 4.17X, respectively.Conclusion: Hold Micron for NowMicron’s recent sell-off reflects short-term headwinds, but the long-term growth story remains compelling. With its strong positioning in AI and data center markets, along with an attractive valuation, holding Micron stock is the prudent choice for investors willing to navigate near-term volatility.Currently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Wolfspeed Stock Plunges as Analysts Weigh In. Chip Maker's Debt Is the Worry. — Barrons.com,1746805020000,"By Brian SwintShares of semiconductor maker Wolfspeed plunged Friday as Wall Street analysts issued negative research on the stock.Earnings that came in line with expectations weren't enough to reassure investors concerned with the company's debt levels.The problem is that Wolfspeed, which produces silicon wafers in the U.S., was promised $750 million under former President Joe Biden's Chips Act. Receiving it may be a problem as President Donald Trump tries to undo his predecessor's work. At the same time, the company has a $575 million payment due to creditors next year.Short interest in Wolfspeed, a measure of how much of a company's stock has been borrowed for bets that the price would drop, has taken off this year. The shares went through a short squeeze last month as investors bid up the stock price, forcing short sellers to buy to close out their bearish bets.Wolfspeed is slimming down its management team by 30%, the company said Thursday during its first earnings call with new CEO Robert Feurle. Chairman Tom Werner said the company is still working with lenders ""to address our capital structure so that Wolfspeed has a strong financial foundation."" Executives didn't take questions from analysts.CFO Neill Reynolds, on the earnings call, said Wolfspeed will start naming the risk of continuing as a ""going concern"" in future filings as it negotiates with creditors, possibly in court.Wolfspeed shares plunged 26% to $3.30 Friday. The stock has traded as high as about $7.50 this year and as low as about $2.50. Shares have lost more than 80% in the past 12 months.William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer suspended coverage of the company, withdrawing the firm's previous Market Perform rating.Others stuck with coverage but downgraded the shares.""Wolfspeed faces significant financial challenges in a sluggish macro environment with financial losses, high leverage, Chips Act funding challenges underpinning doubts over going concern,"" said Atif Malik, an analyst at Citigroup. The bank cut its target price to $3 from $7 and downgraded the stock to Sell.J.P. Morgan analysts Samik Chatterjee and Joseph Cardoso downgraded the stock to Underweight in a note Friday morning, without giving a price target. It will be hard for the company to reach its goal of generating positive cash flow in the coming fiscal year, they wrote.Over at Charter Equity Research, analyst Jack Egan rates the shares Market Underperform. ""Difficulties refinancing the debt, continued cash burn and slowing demand in materials increased the specter of bankruptcy and will depress the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Egan wrote.Piper Sandler analysts led by Harsh Kumar weren't as pessimistic, but did move their price target to $6 after the results. ""WOLF has many steps ahead of itself to complete its turnaround but is course-correcting appropriately at this time,"" they wrote in a note.Wolfspeed competes with chip makers like Alpha & Omega and Indie Semiconductor, both of whose shares rose Friday. All are substantially smaller than well-known chip companies such as Nvidia, Intel, and Broadcom.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

CRDO Tanks 33% in 3 Months: Should You Hold the Stock or Make an Exit?,1746798420000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd CRDO stock has slipped 33.3% over the past three months, significantly more than the Electronic-Semiconductors industry’s decline of 16.4%. The broader Computer and Technology sector and S&P 500 Composite have registered declines of 11.5% and 7.8%, respectively, over the same time frame. The markets since April have been affected by evolving U.S. trade policy and diminishing macroeconomic visibility. Price PerformanceCRDO gained 6.1% yesterday and closed trading at $51.39, but the stock is down 41% below its 52-week high of $86.69. This is likely to spook investors as they contemplate how to strategize their investment now. The natural question is: Should you stay invested or exit now? Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this AI stock and see whether it is worth staying invested or not.AI Boom to Drive CRDO Top LineCredo is a provider of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the data infrastructure market. Amid exponential data growth and rapid AI proliferation, market demand for faster and energy-efficient connectivity solutions continues to increase. This bodes well for Credo.One of Credo’s key strengths lies in its Active Electrical Cables (AEC) product line, which posted triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The growth is driven by its increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.CRDO Focuses on Product LaunchesCredo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include a portfolio of PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. The company expects the PCIe products to considerably expand its total addressable market. This expansion into PCIe connectivity further solidifies the company's competitive positioning in the high-performance computing and AI markets.Momentum in the optical business, particularly for Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. In April 2025, CRDO unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.Growing Demand for RetimersCRDO’s PCIe retimers and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo Technology for significant future revenue growth. CRDO Provides Strong Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO reported $135 million in revenues, up 87% sequentially and 154% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%. This surge was mainly driven by its largest hyperscale customer, which significantly scaled the production of AI platforms, reflecting the growing demand for AI-powered connectivity solutions.Challenges Aplenty for CRDODespite Credo’s strong performance and innovative solutions, several challenges pose headwinds to its prospects. CRDO’s business is heavily tilted toward AI-related infrastructure and the hyperscale cloud market spending. While these segments are currently experiencing high growth, they are also cyclically dependent on AI capex spending, which could decelerate after initial buildouts.Credo’s non-GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter surged 16% sequentially to $43.8 million, primarily due to higher headcount. Increasing costs could become a problem if the revenue growth does not keep pace.In the last reported quarter, 86% of revenue came from a single end customer. This intense customer concentration risk can impact revenues as the company becomes highly vulnerable to the loss of business from those clients. To diversify its base, CRDO added that it has two additional hyperscalers in qualification and has already achieved volume production with three others. The company expects to ramp up with these two hyperscalers in fiscal 2026.These factors, along with increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties, may impact CRDO’s growth trajectory. Credo competes with semiconductor giants like Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc . MRVL.Analysts also seem wary as reflected in unchanged revisions for earnings estimates in the past 60 days. CRDO Falls Steeper Than PeersCRDO’s 33.3% decline is also much steeper than peers like Broadcom and Cirrus Logic, Inc . CRUS. Broadcom and Cirrus Logic have declined 11.6% and 6.5%, respectively. However, Marvell’s stock has declined 48.9% in the same time frame. CRDO Trades at a PremiumCredo Technology stock is also not so cheap, as its Value Style Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 12.92, higher than the Electronic-Semiconductors sector’s multiple of 6.97.In comparison, Broadcom trades at a forward 12-month P/S multiple of 14.46, while Cirrus Logic and Marvell Technology are trading at a multiple of 2.76 and 5.71, respectively.Hold CRDO for NowWhile Credo appears well-positioned in the AI-driven connectivity space, there are several factors that could exert downward pressure on the stock. Key concerns include customer concentration, competitive pressures, stretched valuation, and overreliance on AI spending.CRDO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:5a0015f9b094b:0-crdo-tanks-33-in-3-months-should-you-hold-the-stock-or-make-an-exit/

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Likely to Influence LRCX’s Quarterly PerformanceLam Research has been riding the wave of a strong rebound in the semiconductor industry, driven by the surging demand for memory and advanced AI applications. The rise in spending on AI and machine learning, particularly with the growing influence of Generative AI, is likely to have provided a significant boost to the company's performance in the fiscal third quarter. The increasing need for advanced AI-centric chips has become a key growth catalyst.Heightened dynamic random access memory (DRAM) spending, especially in response to demand for high-bandwidth memory, is likely to have played in Lam Research's favor. The company's momentum in 3D DRAM and advanced packaging technologies is also expected to have added to its strong performance. At the same time, ongoing technological advancements are pushing NAND spending higher, which is likely to contribute to Lam’s quarterly results.Lam Research’s focus on expanding semiconductor fabrication capabilities, along with its heavy investment in research and development, positions it well in a competitive landscape. Its innovation through Semiverse solutions, particularly in high-aspect-ratio memory hole etch for NAND, is likely to have fueled this progress. LRCX’s strategic investments in cutting-edge technologies are likely to have bolstered its performance in the foundry and logic segment, while the increasing adoption of 3D architectures is expected to have supported growth in its etch and deposition services.The company’s robust suite of tools, which enable foundry logic inflections, is likely to have secured strong customer traction. With the accelerating deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), Lam Research’s semiconductor and memory solutions remain in high demand, reinforcing its market position in the fiscal third quarter.All these factors are likely to have driven growth in system revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts fiscal third-quarter system revenues at $2.94 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 22.6%, underscoring Lam Research’s continued strength in the evolving tech landscape. The consensus mark for the Customer Support segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 22.7%.LRCX Stock Price Performance & ValuationLam Research shares have plunged 26.5% over the past year, underperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has risen 6.2%.

Currently, LRCX is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 16.94X compared with the industry’s 21.71X. Compared with industry peers, the stock trades at lower multiples than Broadcom and Marvell Technology, while at higher multiple than QUALCOMM. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and QUALCOMM have forward 12-month P/E multiples of 23.8X, 17.68X and 11.15X, respectively.Forward 12-Month P/E RatioInvestment Thesis for Lam Research StockLam Research has long been a pillar of the chip equipment world, especially in etch and deposition technology, which are critical for producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging technologies essential for AI workloads. These leading-edge technologies are helping it capitalize on the opportunities from the booming demand for AI and datacenter chips, which require advanced fabrication technologies.In 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion by 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents further growth opportunities for Lam Research’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.Nonetheless, Lam Research is not immune to risks. U.S.-China trade tensions pose a significant challenge. China accounted for 31% of its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues, down from 37% in the prior quarter. During the last reported quarter earnings call, the company revealed that $700 million in expected sales from restricted Chinese customers will not materialize in 2025, creating a noticeable sales gap.Additionally, declining demand for mature-node semiconductor equipment is weighing on Lam Research’s foundry business. Foundry revenues fell from 41% of system sales in the first quarter to 35% in the second quarter, reflecting weaker demand. With TSMC and other foundries slowing their mature-node spending, Lam Research’s growth in this segment could remain sluggish.Conclusion: Hold Lam Research for NowWhile geopolitical risks and mature-node weakness could create short-term headwinds, Lam Research’s discounted valuation, solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling long-term hold. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7990c75bd094b:0-lam-research-set-to-report-q3-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/

Nvidia and 29 Other Stocks to Play AI — Barrons.com,1746732720000,"By Teresa RivasWhile tariffs have caused tech stocks to bend, they won't break, a longtime bull says. It's all thanks to artificial intelligence.The technology sector has been one of the harder-hit areas during the 2025 market downturn. Even as stocks have started to rebound amid hopes for tariff negotiations, the Nasdaq Composite is still down more than 8% year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's loss, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund is off some 13%.Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that tech's underdog status won't last. Perhaps most obviously, the artificial intelligence genie can't be put back in the bottle. AI is becoming increasingly mainstream, whether it's people talking to chatbots, retailers using it to personalize their promotional efforts, or companies hoping to improve efficiency and productivity.In short, the AI revolution will continue to play out for years to come. That's the stance of Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime tech bull. He calls AI the fourth industrial revolution in a new note Thursday, arguing that ""it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.""That creates an opportunity for multiple companies — and their investors — to win. He highlights 30 tech companies that he says will be long-term winners across six areas: hyperscalers, software, consumer internet, cybersecurity, autonomous and robotics, and semiconductors and hardware.Often thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" of AI, semiconductors and hardware makers are the second largest group in his list. They have also been some of the most well-known AI beneficiaries, including Nvidia — Ives calls co-founder Jensen Huang the ""godfather of AI.""Naturally Ives still likes the stock, along with Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. He says AMD will continue to strengthen its position and gain market share, and Taiwan Semi — the world's leading chip foundry — will make it a beneficiary of the global increase in AI investments. In addition, Micron has ""an enviable position within memory,"" while Broadcom, the world leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cloud and AI, will benefit from the buildout of these technologies.More than 15% of cloud services now include some AI component, making hyperscalers another area of huge investments. Major companies in the space ""are expected to spend $325 billion+ in 2025 through AI capital expenditures, representing 40% year-over-year growth and over $100 billion year-over-year increase as data center buildouts continue with the AI Arms Race only just beginning,"" Ives writes."" Microsoft is currently in the driver's seat,"" he says, adding that Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, and Oracle aren't far behind.With both people and businesses ramping up their use of AI, consumer internet companies stand to benefit, too, Ives says. Positives could include AI customer service, to improved search, personalization of ads, and dynamic pricing.His favorite picks stateside are Apple — he estimates about a quarter of the world's population will eventually access AI through an Apple device — and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is still seeing strong underlying demand. Among Chinese stocks, he highlights Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu. It's becoming ""clearer [Alibaba] could be one of the winners in the China AI Arms Race,"" he writes, while Baidu is another major Chinese player poised to do well.Robotics is another key area, as the ""global autonomous vehicle market size is expected to reach $3.22 trillion by 2033 representing a 36% compound annual growth rate,"" Ives writes. Tesla's robo-taxis earn it a spot here, while nuclear energy start-up Oklo will help meet the increasing power demands of automation.Of course, all of these advancements make cybersecurity more important than ever. Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and CyberArk Software are his picks here.Software is the largest category, as 1 billion apps will be with generative AI by 2028, Ive says, noting ""the software era of AI use cases [is] already under way."" Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, IBM, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Adobe, Pegasystems, MongoDB, C3.ai, Elastic, Innodata, and SoundHound are on his list of winners.Tariffs remain a worry, though Ives predicts they won't dent the AI revolution in the long run.He isn't the only optimist on this front. 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere writes Thursday that investors will likely return to megacap tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven because the U.S. economy will likely avoid a recession, though it might slow.""High-quality, monopolistic companies with strong earnings momentum are favorable in our base case of an economic muddle through, especially after large price drawdowns,"" he writes.Time to ask ChatGPT if tech is cheap enough to buy the dip.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AMD, Micron, Broadcom Stocks Fall. The Chip Fallout Continues. — Barrons.com",1744899960000,"Elsa OhlenAdvanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, and Micron Technology dropped Thursday after suffering another blow from President Donald Trump's trade policy, and despite analysts lowering estimates due to restrictions on artificial-intelligence chips to China.AMD stock traded down 0.5% to $87.81 after the opening bell on Thursday. That follows a 7.4% drop on Wednesday after news broke that U.S. exports of certain AI chips would now be subject to new licensing requirements.While not an outright ban, it appears no licenses have been granted.Broadcom stock fell 0.9% to $172.96, and Micron stock dropped 2.6% to $67.56. Qualcomm shares rose 0.3% to $136.14, while Nvidia stock slid 2.9% to $101.44.This week, the first shots were fired in the trade war in the tech world, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote Thursday. ""This is just the beginning of what is going to be a long and drawn-out process between the U.S. and China with 145% reciprocal tariffs now in place and the Street/market now waiting for any signs or tea leaves of some negotiations to kick off, "" he said.""Nvidia and U.S. Big Tech [are] caught in the eye of this Category 5 storm.""Products in the export restrictions would include AMD's MI308, Nvidia's H20, as well as any other chips with similar memory or bandwidth.AMD said it expects to apply for licenses, but there are no assurances they'll be granted. The company also predicted an $800 million hit for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.""Clearly, we may need to wait for the Trump administration to finish its tariff and regulatory exploits before shares of Nvidia (and any semis company with sales into China) can get relief,"" Melius analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote. ""However, it will be good to finally get this China sales overhang behind us,"" Melius added, referring to the event as ""whiplash strik[ing] again.""KeyBanc analyst John Vinh lowered his 2025 estimates on AMD revenue and earnings per share by 7% and 13%, respectively, due to the export restrictions, maintaining a Sector Weight rating on shares.On the flip side, Jefferies analysts led by Blayne Curtis highlighted multiple positive signals for AI demand, however, ""don't see [Nvidia] stock working until these AI rules and tariff impacts are better understood.""The iShares Semiconductor exchange-traded fund has dropped over 20% this year and was down 0.7% on Thursday.An earnings report from chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing early Thursday also helped ease worries around chip tariffs.

Chips Stocks Rise as U.S. Plans to Overhaul Curbs on AI Chip Exports,1746716580000,"By Kelly CloonanChip stocks rose across the board as the Trump administration plans to overhaul export regulations on U.S. chip companies.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.8% to $104.20 on Thursday. Intel rose 2.3%, while Qualcomm and Broadcom both ticked up around 1%. Nvidia shares remained flat.The Commerce Department plans to replace a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips countries like India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel can buy, a spokeswoman said.The rule, commonly known as AI diffusion, had been set to go into effect May 15. It aimed to prevent other countries from routing U.S. chips to adversaries like China, but was seen as controversial across the tech industry. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle argued it would harm American companies' business prospects abroad without doing much to hinder China.Other regulations appear to remain for now, though. The Trump administration recently issued new export-licensing requirements covering Nvidia's H20 chips, which the company said would result in a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings. AMD's MI308 processors also are affected, with the company expecting charges of $800 million.Write to Kelly Cloonan at kelly.cloonan@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010812:0-chips-stocks-rise-as-u-s-plans-to-overhaul-curbs-on-ai-chip-exports/
Broadcom’s Apple Relationship: AI Opportunity Meets Tariff Risk,1744899960000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] As one of the largest companies in the world,  semiconductor stock Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO naturally has relationships with some of the other most prominent firms on the globe. Due to the market fixation on  AI , many have become aware of Broadcom’s relationship with Google's parent company, Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG . Alphabet developed its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) with Broadcom’s chip technology, which it uses to train its AI models.However, outside of AI, Broadcom also has a historical relationship with the largest public company in the world, Apple NASDAQ:AAPL . Apple uses Broadcom chips in its wireless consumer devices. This relationship may take on a new form, as Broadcom has reportedly been working with Apple to develop AI chips.The analysis below will dive into Broadcom’s relationship with Apple . Just how significant is Broadcom’s non-AI Apple business? How exposed could Broadcom be to tariff-related risks within this business line? Additionally, is Apple actually trying to build AI chips with Broadcom technology, and what type of upside could this mean for Broadcom if so?Apple: Broadcom’s Wireless StalwartBroadcom’s non-AI relationship with Apple is big . Before fiscal Q1 2025, Broadcom categorized its semiconductor revenues as follows: networking, wireless, server storage, broadband, and industrial. In Q4 2024, the company brought in approximately $2.2 billion in wireless revenue. Almost all of this likely came from Apple.Press releases clearly show that Broadcom makes chips used in Apple products. This includes things like WiFi cards and 5G radio frequency components. In its Q2 2024 earnings call, Broadcom referenced a North American wireless customer, saying that it “represents all of our wireless business.” Reading between the lines, they are clearly talking about Apple. Overall, this $2.2 billion in wireless revenue represented nearly 16% of Broadcom’s total $14 billion in revenue that quarter.Clearly, Apple is a huge part of Broadcom’s business . So, how could tariffs impact Broadcom’s business due to its relationship with Apple?Recent Tariff Changes Provide a Reprieve for Apple and BroadcomMarkets were highly concerned about Apple after the tariff back-and-forth between the United States and China. Apple has Chinese companies assemble around 90% of its iPhones. President Trump's  145% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports would force Apple to raise iPhone prices, which could greatly hurt sales volume. This would have been bad news for Broadcom, as fewer iPhone sales mean fewer chip sales.It looks like Apple and Broadcom can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. The United States Customs and Border Protection recently announced that electronics will be exempt from these reciprocal tariffs. However, these companies are far from out of the woods. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on electronics are still coming.The government will do this using sector-specific duties on semiconductors. Lutnick stated that the government could enact these in one to two months.Overall, it's difficult to say anything concrete with tariff policies changing daily. However, for Broadcom, these tariffs that could soon affect Apple products are destructive. They will hurt the firm’s non-AI chip business, possibly in a big way. It is important to note that Broadcom’s wireless business really wasn’t growing much anyway. Growth in this segment has ranged from slightly positive to slightly negative over many of the past quarters. Despite this, Broadcom has continued to succeed, indicating the company may not be massively hurt by lower Apple device demand.Broadcom and Apple's AI Ambitions and Potential Partnership [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] In early December 2024, reports emerged that Apple was working with Broadcom to build its own AI chip. Apple wants to use the product in AI servers to enhance the capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Although Apple and Broadcom have not verified this relationship, some clues suggest that this could be true. Apple’s $500 billion investment in the United States will go largely toward making AI servers.Within this announcement, Apple said the servers will use “Apple silicon,"" indicating that Apple is designing custom chips. Tech firms like Alphabet have previously found a key partner in Broadcom in designing custom chips. Thus, it seems very possible that Apple and Broadcom are pairing up on this venture to do the same.This could significantly boost Broadcom’s revenues. Apple is the world’s most valuable public company, but many have seen the firm as a laggard when it comes to adopting AI. Broadcom would be happy to help them catch up.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:a77b9b2a9094b:0-broadcom-s-apple-relationship-ai-opportunity-meets-tariff-risk/
Nvidia Stock Wavers as Trump Plans to Scrap Biden's Chip-Export Rules — Barrons.com,1746716340000,"Adam ClarkNvidia and other semiconductor stocks were rising Thursday as the Trump administration said it plans to scrap regulations that would limit exports of artificial-intelligence chips worldwide.Nvidia shares were down 0.3% at $116.71 in Thursday morning trading, after gaining more than 3% the previous day. Advanced Micro Devices stock was gaining 2.6%, and Broadcom stock was rising 0.4%.Chip makers were rising after the Commerce Department said Wednesday afternoon that it doesn't intend to implement AI processor restrictions drawn up under the Biden administration, The Wall Street Journal reported . The curbs were set to go into effect on May 15 and would have limited sales more widely than existing sanctions on exports to China.The so-called ""AI diffusion"" rules were expected to reduce the long-term market for AI chips by as much as 10%, according to analysts at BofA Securities.""We welcome the administration's leadership and new direction on AI policy. With the AI Diffusion Rule revoked, America will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, "" Nvidia said in an emailed statement.However, it isn't clear if the overhaul will lead to alternative rules on chip exports, which could potentially be even more onerous. The White House has considered including AI-processor limits as part of bilateral agreements with individual countries, according to the report.More information could come with President Donald Trump's planned visit to the Middle East next week, where AI chip exports are likely to be on the agenda.""We generally expect that Trump will increase the total of chips allowed to be sold globally, starting with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but this could also come with more enforcement to prevent the diversion of banned chips to China,"" wrote Raymond James analyst Ed Mills in a research note.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Top U.S. Firms May Set the Course for Productivity,1746715260000,"By Matt GrossmanNew analysis suggests that cutting-edge tech giants and other standout companies have pushed the economy forward more than previously understood.In a new paper, researchers at McKinsey found that a relatively small handful of top businesses have done far more to accelerate workplace productivity than the vast sea of their competitors.Productivity measures how much workers accomplish, on average, during a standard shift: an important variable in determining whether the economy can thrive and grow without generating inflation.Many economists have figured that America's solid productivity improvements in the past decade grew out of a massive agglomeration of tiny tweaks at millions of businesses. In fact, what happens inside some of the U.S.'s megacaps likely weighs quite a bit heavier, according to McKinsey.Researchers at the consulting firm's internal research arm studied how much each of a set of more than 8,000 firms in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany added to the overall group's productivity between 2011 and 2019. They found in a report published Wednesday that in the U.S., just 5% of companies contributed 78% of the productivity growth that the entire U.S. group achieved over those eight years.As might be expected, tech giants including Amazon.com, Nvidia and Broadcom were prominent among the outperformers. In other industries, superstar retailers such as Home Depot have moved the ball forward, as have, perhaps more surprisingly, big air carriers such as United Airlines, McKinsey thinks.By the research team's thinking, each of these productivity superstars harnessed breakaway capabilities to transform the way its workers get things done. Home Depot's logistics, pricing and IT infrastructure, for example, have allowed its retail workers to produce far more value on the job than cashiers at mom-and-pop hardware stores ever could.That's not to say broader factors don't also play a part. The American culture of enterprise and the U.S.'s relatively permissive rules for businesses foster an environment that makes those innovations possible, said Olivia White, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, which produced the report.""It's very much going to be the fruit of both the regulatory environment in the country and also the ecosystem among the companies,"" White said. ""The way the whole system works really, really matters.""Data published Thursday by the Labor Department showed that productivity fell by 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, after rising by 1.7% in 2024's fourth quarter. It was the first quarterly decline in productivity in almost three years.Because explaining productivity is so subtle, many economists don't pay that much attention to changes from quarter to quarter. Over 2023 and 2024, U.S. productivity growth averaged about 2.6% per year, well above other big economies' track record.During those years, American productivity outperformance fueled a remarkable stretch of resilient growth coupled with falling inflation, a pairing that lifted the U.S. as a magnet for global investment. Yet there's been no deep consensus among economists on what set the U.S. apart.Competing explanations have included an intensive shortage of workers that hit during the postpandemic boom, which forced companies to deploy limited staff more productively. Others have argued that a large cohort of newly created businesses gave rise to thousands of new sandboxes where bosses could rethink how work gets done.McKinsey's research casts some doubt on those ideas. During the 2010s at least, McKinsey's new work suggests, U.S. productivity growth had a lot more to do with seismic changes that originated from a small posse of standouts.The firm also cites bold moves such as how Broadcom shifted its strategy to focus on infrastructure software, rather than just semiconductors, as turning points in the U.S. productivity story. Similarly, workers who played a part in Apple's smartphone business were helping to develop a genuinely life-changing and remarkably profitable product.Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010576:0-top-u-s-firms-may-set-the-course-for-productivity/

Incident Prediction Strengthens AVGO's Portfolio: Is the Stock a Buy?,1744830000000,"Broadcom AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), on Tuesday. The AI-powered protection helps in predicting and disrupting living-off-the-land attacks and other cyberthreats. SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Incident Prediction leverages a deep learning model that is trained on more than 500,000 real-world attack events.

Nvidia Stock Leaps on Report Trump Will Relax AI Chip Export Curbs — Barrons.com,1746648660000,"Adam Clark and Liz MoyerNvidia stock jumped late in Wednesday's trading session after a report the Trump administration could relax export curbs on artificial intelligence chips.Shares of Nvidia closed up 3.1%. Other chip stocks also rallied after a Bloomberg report said President Donald Trump would overturn AI chip export curbs put into place by the Biden administration that were set to go into effect.Earnings from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer indicated healthy demand for artificial-intelligence chips, but they also highlighted risks from export restrictions and the transition to new infrastructure.Positive signs came from rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, which reported better-than-expected earnings, and gave sales guidance ahead of expectations in a report on Tuesday. Shares of AMD rose 1.8% on Wednesday.AMD warned that U.S. export controls on semiconductors would cost the company $1.5 billion in revenue this year, in a reminder of the threat hanging over the chip industry.Nvidia has already disclosed that its first-quarter results will include a $5.5 billion charge associated with inventory and purchase commitments related to the H20 chip for the Chinese market, following the imposition of licensing requirements. Analysts at Jefferies have suggested that will translate to around a $10 billion hit to revenue.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated the market in China for AI chips will be $50 billion in a few years, and warned that restriction on semiconductors exports wouldn't limit Chinese military capacity, in comments late on Tuesday to attendees of the Milken Institute annual meeting.Elsewhere, AI-server maker Super Micro reported earnings and revenue at the top end of its guided range on Tuesday, but provided disappointing guidance for the current quarter, noting some customers were delaying decisions.

Micron Stock Soars 23% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1748004900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU has seen its share price soar 22.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 10.7% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit or continue holding the stock?Trade Truce Sparks Rally in Micron SharesMicron’s latest rally was fueled by optimism around improving U.S.-China trade relations. Since late April, investor sentiment has been lifted by reports of a temporary easing of tariffs between the world’s two largest economies.Under the new deal, the United States agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce duties on U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. These revised rates will remain in effect for 90 days, creating short-term certainty for global commerce.The temporary trade truce revived hopes for smoother international trade and strengthened confidence in the economic outlook. As fears of escalating trade disruptions faded, equities, particularly in the tech and semiconductor sectors, rallied sharply.Apart from Micron, this broader market optimism also boosted share prices of other semiconductor players, including NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Over the past month, shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices have soared 25%, 22.5% and 17.8%, respectively.Micron’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI and Data Centers Power Micron’s Growth EngineMicron sits at the heart of several transformative tech trends. Its exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance data centers, autonomous vehicles and industrial IoT uniquely positions the company for sustainable long-term growth.As AI adoption accelerates, the demand for advanced memory solutions like DRAM and NAND is soaring. Micron’s investments in next-gen DRAM and 3D NAND ensure it remains competitive in delivering the performance needed for modern computing.The company’s diversification strategy is also bearing fruit. By shifting its focus away from the more volatile consumer electronics market and toward resilient verticals such as automotive and enterprise IT, Micron has created a more stable revenue base. This balance enhances its ability to weather cyclical downturns, a critical trait in the semiconductor space.Micron is also riding a strong wave in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand. Its HBM3E products are attracting significant interest for their superior energy efficiency and bandwidth, ideal for AI workloads. In January 2025, NVIDIA confirmed that Micron is a core HBM supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, signaling deep integration in the AI supply chain.Additionally, Micron’s newly announced HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to launch in 2026 with further expansion in 2027, underscores its commitment to scaling production for AI-driven markets.Strong Forecasts Reinforce Micron’s Financial StrengthMicron’s financial outlook remains robust. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2025 targets suggest robust year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 433% for fiscal 2025 and 56% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMU Valuation Still Looks Compelling Despite Recent SurgeIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 2.45X, significantly lower than the sector’s 6.07X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including NVIDIA, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 15.59X, 15.96X and 5.31X, respectively.Margin Pressures Cloud Micron’s Near-Term OutlookWhile Micron impressed with 38.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Falling profitability, even amid strong AI-driven demand, raises questions about Micron’s ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Final Thoughts: Hold MU Stock for NowMicron’s fundamentals remain strong, and its position in the AI-driven memory market is well-established. The company offers compelling long-term growth potential, maintains a disciplined approach to innovation and trades at a discount relative to peers. However, ongoing margin compression warrants caution in the short term.Given this balance of strengths and emerging risks, investors are advised to hold Micron stock for now.

"Advanced Micro Devices 'Remarkably' Guides Q2 Revenue Above Street Despite Export Headwinds, Morgan Stanley Says",1746637679000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD pulled off a difficult feat Tuesday, reporting better-than-expected financial results for Q1 and ""remarkably"" raising its Q2 revenue forecast above Wall Street estimates, analysts at Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday in a research note. The chipmaker's improved Q2 outlook, climbing to a range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion, was maybe its most impressive accomplishment given the likely impact of export controls on China, the analysts said. Overall, the company is now expecting the restrictions on Chinese semiconductor sales to reduce revenue by around $1.5 billion this year, including a $700 million hit during the current quarter and the rest largely occurring during Q3, they said. ""That's a slightly smaller headwind that we had expected, but (still) in the ballpark,"" the analysts said. Based on the new guidance, Morgan Stanley is now expecting Advanced Micro to earn $0.54 per share in Q2, excluding one-time items, on around $7.41 billion in revenue. For 2025, the firm is projecting non-GAAP net income of $4.20 per share, down from $4.53 per share previously, and $32.41 billion in revenue, up from $31.48 billion. The Morgan Stanley analysts also lowered their price target for Advanced Micro shares to $121 from $137 while reiterating their equal-weight stock rating, citing macro-economic factors and a slightly more speculative position relative to rival chipmakers Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , especially with its artificial intelligence offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250507:A3372387:0/

Marvell Stock Falls Sharply. What's Hurting the Former AI Chip Favorite. — Barrons.com,1746627960000,"By Adam ClarkMarvell Technology was falling sharply Wednesday after the company postponed its investor day in the face of market uncertainty.It's another blow for a stock which has lost its status as a favored play on the artificial-intelligence trend.The designer of data-storage and networking chips said it had decided to postpone its previously scheduled investor-day event from June 10 to an unspecified future date in 2026, citing ""the dynamic macroeconomic environment,"" in a statement late on Tuesday.At the same time, Marvell reaffirmed the midpoint of first-quarter revenue guidance and narrowed its range. It expects revenue of about $1.875 billion, with a range of plus or minus 2%.The stock was down 8.9% at $55.75 on Wednesday. That's set to add to a 45% drop this year so far through Tuesday's close, which has wiped out all of Marvell's gains from 2024.Marvell became a market darling last year alongside peer Broadcom as investors bet that its clients — which analysts believe include Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft — would spend heavily on the company's custom chip designs as they sought alternatives to Nvidia hardware.However, poorly received guidance alongside quarterly earnings in March sunk the stock as investors soured on AI plays amid tariff uncertainty. Marvell has also been hit by concerns that it might lose out on designing the next generation of Amazon's custom Trainium AI chips.""The postponed investor day will only add to the wall of worry that has developed around the name, particularly around Marvell's ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] opportunity following reports that Taiwanese competitor Alchip has won Amazon's next-generation Trainium 3 project,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji in a research note.Marvell did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.However Naji still sees opportunity in the shares, reiterating an Outperform rating on Marvell stock. He noted the company now trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 times his forecast for its 2025 earnings and 18 times its forecast 2026 earnings — a far cry from the forward earnings multiple of more than 40 times it carried late last year.""While at these levels the stock is not expensive, we worry that the shares may be range-bound until investor confidence in Marvell's custom chip pipeline improves,"" Naji wrote.Investors might hope for some reassurance at a June 17 webinar focused on the future of custom silicon technology for AI infrastructure, which Marvell said it would hold.""While we are encouraged that the company still plans to address its custom silicon opportunity, where the firm noted 'great progress,' we also read into the indefinite rescheduling of its investor day as a likely negative indicator for the firm's near-term upcoming July quarter outlook,"" wrote Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree in a research note.Acree lowered his estimates for Marvell's revenue for its fiscal 2026 year — ending Jan. 31 2026 — to $8.11 billion from $8.19 billion previously and his full-year earnings per share forecast to $2.74 from $2.80.The Benchmark analyst lowered his target price to $95 from $135. However, he kept a Buy rating on the stock and recommended investors take advantage of the weak share price.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What the Era of 'Sovereign AI' Means for Chip Makers — Heard on the Street — WSJ,1747992600000,"By Dan GallagherNvidia is often thought of as the pre-eminent arms dealer for the artificial-intelligence age. Much is riding on the chip maker's not actually being treated like one.Nvidia and rivals including Broadcom, Marvell and Advanced Micro Devices design the key components that supply the massive computing horsepower required for AI services. They are all recipients of the hundreds of billions of dollars that megacap tech companies based in the U.S. are investing to build those services.Other countries want in on the action — in a big way. Saudi Arabia recently struck a deal to buy large amounts of Nvidia's AI chips for local infrastructure projects, and Nvidia has described India as a major customer. In addition, Nvidia was named Thursday as a key partner in an OpenAI-led data-center project in the United Arab Emirates.""AI is going to be part of a national infrastructure the way telco is part of a national infrastructure,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told a meeting of analysts in January. ""Every country has their own telcos.""The flip side is that AI chips are now a highly politicized business, figuring prominently in the U.S.-China trade war, and likely many future conflicts to come. For Nvidia and its competitors, that can be a blessing and a curse.The Trump administration has sharply restricted the ability of U.S. chip makers to sell their wares in China and some other countries. Future sales outside the U.S. could be linked closely to trade deals with individual countries. This new political reality for AI chip companies was highlighted as last week's deals were timed to coincide with President Trump's swing through the Middle East. Huang, the CEO who is now a global superstar, even ditched his trademark leather jacket and wore a suit for the occasion.Huang has previously described the concept of countries' investing directly in artificial intelligence as ""sovereign AI"" — and it is an important element underpinning Nvidia's growth ambitions. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates that the sovereign AI market could reach $50 billion annually in the long term, or 10% to 15% of the ""global AI infrastructure opportunity.""Nvidia has more than doubled its annual revenue in each of the past two fiscal years, and it is expected by Wall Street to keep growing at a strong double-digit-percentage pace for the next three years. That would take the company's annual sales well past the $300 billion mark, a level no chip company has ever come close to achieving.Hopes are high for Nvidia's AI competitors as well. Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is seen increasing annual revenue by double-digit percentages consecutively for the next five years, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha.That would be a feat the 56-year-old chip maker hasn't managed since at least 1990, which is as far back as data measured by S&P Global Market Intelligence goes. AMD scored its own deal in the desert last week, landing a $10 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply AI data-center components for the country's Humain venture.Sovereign AI projects can help chip companies including Nvidia and AMD reduce their reliance on the deep pockets of such companies as Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Capital spending by those companies has been on a tear as they race to build up AI capabilities, but historically such spending has been lumpy and volatile. It might depend, for instance, on the availability of real estate or electricity, as well as the near-term business trends of those companies.""Sovereign AI nicely complements commercial cloud investments,"" wrote BofA's Arya in a recent report. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein was relatively blunt. ""For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep-pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,"" he wrote.Investors like the idea. Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their stock prices jump by more than a third over the past month, while AMD's shares are up around 30%.Sovereign AI projects will bring their own kind of turbulence. For one thing, project values announced at political events might prove to be exaggerated and won't always materialize as revenue. What is more, any foreign entity buying up advanced chips must make sure it doesn't run afoul of the U.S.'s efforts to keep AI components out of the hands of China and other adversaries.The Trump administration scrapped the so-called AI diffusion rule, which would have placed limits on AI chips sales even to friendly countries. That was a notable victory for Nvidia and its peers, and it triggered a rally in their shares. But the administration is reportedly considering new steps that could link AI chip sales to trade deals with individual countries.More broadly, the rise of sovereign AI exposes chip companies to levels of geopolitical intrigue normally associated with defense contractors. That could produce lots of unpredictability for Nvidia and its peers.For instance, Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter report next week will include a $5.5 billion charge for chips it had designed for the Chinese market that were later banned for sale there by the U.S. government. Analysts are worried about how that will affect the company's outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, even with overall demand for AI chips still running strong.Regardless, Nvidia's market cap is back above $3 trillion, and now ahead of Apple's. Investors are betting big that this arms dealer can stay above the fray.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523002696:0/

Pre-Markets Open in The Red ,1744815240000,"Economic & Earnings CommentaryPre-market futures are still in the red at this hour, but threaten to break out into positive territory compared with where we were overnight. We’re also bifurcated presently: -40 points, roughly, on both the Dow and S&P 500, but -260 points on he tech-heavy Nasdaq.A report that NVIDIA NVDA will take a $5.5 charge on its H20 AI chips that were believed to be headed to China. The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has snuffed this out — news reports refer to this as being “curbed” — and sent NVIDIA shares down -6% in pre-market trading. AMD AMD is doing even worse, Broadcom AVGO a bit better — but still all down.Retail Sales Improve for March: Evidence of “Pull-Forward”?We remain at the mercy of trade tariff policy for the foreseeable future, and this goes for plenty of economic reports for last month, as well. To wit, U.S. Retail Sales for March reached +1.4% on headline, 20 basis points (bps) ahead of expectations. Ex-autos, +0.5% is a strong showing, even if it is still -20 bps below the big upward revision to February’s number.Ex-autos and gas swung up to +0.8% last month, equalling the upward revision for the previous month (which itself was ratcheted up 30 bps) and the strongest month since September 2024’s +1.2%. The Control number, which feeds other economic data like PCE (which comes out at the end of this month), was a bit weaker, relatively: +0.4%, from the upwardly revised +1.3% for February.At a glance, these figures all seem to be U.S. companies getting ahead of the tariffs, which began two weeks ago today, April 2nd. Remain unconvinced? Check auto parts deliveries last month, which rose +5.3%. This resembles more a year-over-year number than a month-over-month one. Perhaps we’ll need to compare these figures to the coming months, but it stands to reason we see a “pull-forward” in this data.Q1 Earnings Roundup: TRV, ABT, USB & MoreQ1 earnings season continues to heat up. Major insurance provider and Dow component The Travelers TRV posted a strong beat in its Q1 earnings ahead of the opening bell: $1.91 per share was nearly +200% stronger than the 64 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $11.87 billion, however, came in -2.17% from estimates. Shares are up +2.5% on the news, adding to the stock’s +3.6% year to date.Abbott Laboratories ABT beat on its Q1 earnings by 2 cents to $1.09 per share, while missing slightly on its top line: $10.36 billion versus $10.42 billion expected. Better performance in its Pharma and Nutrition space were offset somewhat by lower numbers from its Diagnostics segment. Shares are down marginally, but still up more than +10% year to date.U.S. Bank USB keeps the train of big banks reporting earnings this week, notching slight beats on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.03 per share on $6.96 billion in revenues outpaced expectations by +4% and +0.6%, respectively. Shares are up +1.4% in today’s pre-market, but still have a long climb back from -17% year to date.Swedish auto parts provider Autoliv ALV posted strong beats for both earnings and revenues in its Q1 report this morning, beating on earnings per share by +25% and +4.25% on quarterly sales. Again, we sense some “beat the tariffs” trading going on with these figures, but shares are up +8% ahead of the regular session, making up a good chunk of its -12% level year to date.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a4890eef9094b:0-pre-markets-open-in-the-red/

SONY’s Financial Services revenues are benefiting from sales growth at Sony Life and higher investment gains from market volatility. SONY’s The Music unit’s sales are backed by higher revenues from streaming services in Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Solid hardware and non-first-party game software sales and forex impacts are fueling the GN&S unit.

AFRM expects revenues to be in the range of $3.13-$3.19 billion in fiscal 2025. Growing active merchant numbers, improving gross merchandise value, and the average balance of loans are driving merchant network revenues and interest income. Key partnerships, like those with Apple Pay and Hotels.com, play a vital role in AFRM’s expansion. It has officially expanded to the United Kingdom, through a partnership with Alternative Airlines. Tapping into industries like travel, hospitality, and technology bodes well for the company. Affirm Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 37.1% and 96.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2025).

Strong demand for AVGO’s application-specific integrated chips, designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions.

EXE’s LNG exposure reduces price volatility, while efficiency gains are expected to unlock $500 million in cost savings by 2026. Strong financials, a $2.30 per share dividend, and a focus on deleveraging add stability.

Broadcom Stock Gets a Lift on Hyperscaler Earnings & CapEx Boost,1746618300000,"Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ:AVGO continues to be a central player in the AI infrastructure build-out, and recent developments across the tech landscape may strengthen its growth outlook. Despite lingering market concerns about the pace and durability of AI-related spending, recent earnings season delivered a series of encouraging signals. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Several major technology firms reported strong momentum in their AI businesses, along with plans to maintain or increase capital expenditures tied to AI infrastructure.These announcements matter for Broadcom. As a supplier of high-performance networking components and custom silicon that help power large-scale AI deployments, Broadcom’s fortunes are tightly linked to the investment cycles of its largest customers.And while questions around competitive pressures and spending slowdowns have weighed on sentiment in recent months, investor response suggests a shift in tone: since the first of these earnings reports was released on April 24, Broadcom shares have climbed 7% through the May 6 close .The rebound reflects growing confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track—and that Broadcom remains well-positioned to benefit.AI Strength at Google & Meta Signal AI Strength for BroadcomTwo companies known as hyperscale customers of Broadcom are Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOGL , Google's parent company, and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META . Both companies posted strong results, largely due to the AI-centric parts of their business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud segment saw strong revenue growth of 28%. AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions were key drivers of this increase. The company also confirmed its CapEx spending forecast . It plans to allocate $75 billion , much of which will go to AI infrastructure through calendar 2025. The company also said that, like Q4 2024, Cloud demand exceeded capacity this quarter, another sign that CapEx spending isn’t tailing off.Meta also posted better-than-expected results . Its revenue grew at a solid 16% clip, and the price paid per ad increased by 10%. This indicates that the value of advertising on Meta’s apps continues to increase, likely driven by the AI investment the company is making. Meta also provided several examples showing that its AI investments are driving more engagement in its apps. Adding to the optimism around the AI story is the fact that the company actually increased its CapEx guidance for 2025 by 9%. The firm now expects to spend $68 billion at the midpoint.Both of these results are good signs for Broadcom . They show that these AI hyperscale customers are seeing their investment in the technology lead to tangible results. Amid concerns that AI spending could slow down due to the DeepSeek revelations, these companies are in no way signaling that this is actually the case. This is key for Broadcom , considering that big reductions in AI infrastructure spending would be very bad news for the stock. The fact that Broadcom shares sold off over 17% in just one day after the DeepSeek news broke evidences this. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:AVGO] Microsoft’s CapEx to Keep Growing: Could It Be Broadcom’s Next Customer?Microsoft’s NASDAQ:MSFT results also boost Broadcom's confidence , but in a somewhat different way. Microsoft reported a 33% increase in revenue from its Azure cloud business. AI is becoming a larger part of Azure’s growth. Three quarters ago, AI accounted for less than a quarter of the growth in Azure. That percentage has risen every quarter since. In the latest results,  almost half of Azure's growth came from AI . [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Additionally, Microsoft reaffirmed its CapEx spending through the fiscal year ending in June at $80 billion. For the company’s next fiscal year, it has yet to release exact CapEx forecasts . However, the figure will be more than $80 billion. On the earnings call, the company said that compared to fiscal 2025 levels, “ we expect CapEx to grow. ” However, it did mention that the growth rate in CapEx would slow.Microsoft isn't a confirmed customer of Broadcom's AI chips. Still, rising AI demand and growth CapEx support Broadcom's investment case . It shows that investments in AI, which are a huge driver of revenue growth for Broadcom , are paying off. This means that hyperscalers are likely to keep spending on AI, providing a robust source of revenue for Broadcom. Aside from its current hyperscale customers, Broadcom is also in talks to develop custom AI chips for four other hyperscalers. At some point, news could break that Microsoft is one of these firms.Amazon Adds to Optimism, Broadcom’s AI Demand Can Keep HummingFurther good news came from another hyperscaler, Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN . The company noted its AI business is growing at triple digits from the previous year and referenced that demand still exceeds capacity.The company didn’t change its CapEx guidance from $100 billion for calendar 2025. Amazon is not a Broadcom customer, but the reasons for optimism are similar to those related to Microsoft.The AI-related news coming from these hyperscalers provides strong reassurance about Broadcom's growth story . Seeing the AI train continue to chug along for some time is key to the success of Broadcom's stock. Looking forward, it appears the engine will continue to see more coal shoveled into its firebox.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:79fc3da9d094b:0-broadcom-stock-gets-a-lift-on-hyperscaler-earnings-capex-boost/

These 4 Top Investors Bought Over 6 Million Broadcom Shares in Q1,1747922400000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO is one of just 10 stocks globally with a market cap over $1 trillion as of May 21. This makes it one of the most closely watched stocks in the market. Retail investors and famous money managers have come to know this company well. It has played a key role in the AI infrastructure buildout, which has been driving the market higher for some time.Many big investors bought Broadcom in large amounts in Q1. This became clear when they released their 13F filings . That makes a good deal of sense, considering that Broadcom shares fell by more than 27% in Q1. The analysis below will detail some of the highest-profile investors who bought Broadcom in spades. It is important to note that the data on these purchases only extends to March 31. Thus, these investors could have sold or bought more Broadcom shares since. Still, knowing how investors felt about Broadcom and similar companies in Q1 can help retail investors understand how to view the stock going forward.AI Bubble Bear Grantham Owned Nearly 14x More AVGO Than NVIDIA in Q1A huge purchaser of Broadcom in Q1 was investor Jeremy Grantham. Grantham co-founded Grantham, May and Van Otterloo (GMO) and is the company’s long-term investment strategist. Grantham is often considered a contrarian investor, pushing back against overzealous market trends. Many consider him to have predicted the dot-com bubble around two years before it popped. Despite Grantham’s claims that AI investing is a bubble, Grantham’s GMO bought over 1.5 million shares of Broadcom in Q1. Additionally, many of the firm's biggest holdings are among the Magnificent Seven stocks that have invested tens of billions in AI infrastructure.Still, the big decline in Broadcom shares in Q1 could back up Grantham’s claims that the AI bubble would deflate. As of the May 21 close, Broadcom is trading only around 6% below its 2025 high. Assuming the stock stays near this level through the end of Q2, seeing GMO greatly reduce its Broadcom holdings in its Q2 13F would be a logical next step. This would indicate he actually sees Broadcom as part of the AI bubble and simply took advantage of it temporarily deflating in Q1. Interestingly, Grantham has just a $21 million position in NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA , versus $291 million in Broadcom. Sure, NVIDIA only fell 19% in Q1, but this positioning indicates Grantham sees Broadcom as a relatively better value .Renaissance, Two Sigma, and Dalio Buy Over 5 Million Broadcom Shares CombinedAnother massive high-profile Broadcom buyer in Q1 was Renaissance Technologies , an investment firm many regard as the most successful hedge fund of all time. Renaissance purchased over 2.4 million shares of Broadcom in Q1, massively increasing the firm’s stake in the company. Renaissance is notoriously tight-lipped about its thoughts on the market, making it difficult to assert its thinking. However, depending on the data points looked at, one could argue that Renaissance may or may not still see value in Broadcom shares. [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Two Sigma Advisors and Bridgewater Associates are other notable investment companies that bought significant shares of Broadcom in Q1. They bought around 2.5 million and 280,000 shares, respectively. Two Sigma has become known as one of the pioneers of quantitative investing, relying largely on complex math and non-traditional data to invest. For many, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio needs no introduction. He is a prolific author, investing thought leader, and has built what was, at one time, the largest hedge fund in the world.At the end of Q1, Two Sigma held 3.9 million shares of Broadcom. The company hasn’t had even close to this big of a position since Q3 2024, when it held 3.6 million shares. Notably, Broadcom’s average closing price during that period was just $159. In Q1, that figure was $211. The company held more shares in Q1, when the average closing price was about 33% higher. This suggests it thinks Broadcom's intrinsic value has increased very significantly. However, whether it sees value in prices near $230 or higher is more questionable.Broadcom’s Big Gain in Q2 Could Reveal These Investors' True ThoughtsSince Broadcom’s shares now only trade marginally lower than their 2025 peak , these investors' next 13F filings could reveal at what price they are comfortable holding shares.If Broadcom remains near the $230 mark through the rest of Q2, continuing to hold their shares could indicate these investors see potential for the stock to test all-time highs near $250.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:f0037420b094b:0-these-4-top-investors-bought-over-6-million-broadcom-shares-in-q1/
"Retail Sales, Q1 Earnings Show Signs of ""Pull Forward""",1744813680000,"Wednesday, April 16, 2025Pre-market futures are still in the red at this hour, but threaten to break out into positive territory compared with where we were overnight. We’re also bifurcated presently: -40 points, roughly, on both the Dow and S&P 500, but -260 points on he tech-heavy Nasdaq.A report that NVIDIA NVDA will take a $5.5 charge on its H20 AI chips that were believed to be headed to China. The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has snuffed this out — news reports refer to this as being “curbed” — and sent NVIDIA shares down -6% in pre-market trading. AMD AMD is doing even worse, Broadcom AVGO a bit better — but still all down.Retail Sales Improve for March: Evidence of “Pull-Forward”?We remain at the mercy of trade tariff policy for the foreseeable future, and this goes for plenty of economic reports for last month, as well. To wit, U.S. Retail Sales for March reached +1.4% on headline, 20 basis points (bps) ahead of expectations. Ex-autos, +0.5% is a strong showing, even if it is still -20 bps below the big upward revision to February’s number.Ex-autos and gas swung up to +0.8% last month, equalling the upward revision for the previous month (which itself was ratcheted up 30 bps) and the strongest month since September 2024’s +1.2%. The Control number, which feeds other economic data like PCE (which comes out at the end of this month), was a bit weaker, relatively: +0.4%, from the upwardly revised +1.3% for February.At a glance, these figures all seem to be U.S. companies getting ahead of the tariffs, which began two weeks ago today, April 2nd. Remain unconvinced? Check auto parts deliveries last month, which rose +5.3%. This resembles more a year-over-year number than a month-over-month one. Perhaps we’ll need to compare these figures to the coming months, but it stands to reason we see a “pull-forward” in this data.Q1 Earnings Roundup: TRV, ABT, USB & MoreQ1 earnings season continues to heat up. Major insurance provider and Dow component The Travelers TRV posted a strong beat in its Q1 earnings ahead of the opening bell: $1.91 per share was nearly +200% stronger than the 64 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $11.87 billion, however, came in -2.17% from estimates. Shares are up +2.5% on the news, adding to the stock’s +3.6% year to date. For more on TRV’s earnings, click here.Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.Abbott Laboratories ABT beat on its Q1 earnings by 2 cents to $1.09 per share, while missing slightly on its top line: $10.36 billion versus $10.42 billion expected. Better performance in its Pharma and Nutrition space were offset somewhat by lower numbers from its Diagnostics segment. Shares are down marginally, but still up more than +10% year to date.U.S. Bank USB keeps the train of big banks reporting earnings this week, notching slight beats on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.03 per share on $6.96 billion in revenues outpaced expectations by +4% and +0.6%, respectively. Shares are up +1.4% in today’s pre-market, but still have a long climb back from -17% year to date. For more on USB’s earnings, click here.Swedish auto parts provider Autoliv ALV posted strong beats for both earnings and revenues in its Q1 report this morning, beating on earnings per share by +25% and +4.25% on quarterly sales. Again, we sense some “beat the tariffs” trading going on with these figures, but shares are up +8% ahead of the regular session, making up a good chunk of its -12% level year to date.

TSM Stock Soars 20% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1746558000000,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM has seen its share price soar 19.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 16.2% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit, or continue holding the stock?What Drove TSM Stock Higher?Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s recent rally stemmed from broader market optimism. Whispers of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations significantly boosted market sentiment in late April. Protracted trade tensions had previously dampened global economic forecasts and corporate earnings expectations due to tariffs and retaliatory measures.Hints of a potential deal suggested easing tensions, possible tariff reductions and smoother international trade flows. This improved outlook fostered investor confidence, leading to a rally in the equity market as fears of further economic disruption subsided and prospects for global growth seemed brighter.Semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Broadcom, Inc. AVGO, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, were the prime gainers from this rally as they had witnessed a tremendous selloff previously following the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. Over the past month, shares of Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA soared 30.5%, 21.2% and 16.3%, respectively.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI Boom Boosts TSM’s ProspectsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continues to dominate the semiconductor foundry space with its technological superiority and production scale. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has placed Taiwan Semiconductor at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle.The company has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players like NVIDIA, Marvell Technology and Broadcom.In 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, making up a mid-teen percentage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s total revenues, and the momentum is far from over. The company expects AI-related sales to double again in 2025, with an impressive 40% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. This positions TSM as the undisputed backbone of AI-driven technological advancements.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has started 2025 on a strong note by reporting overwhelming first-quarter results, wherein revenues surged 35% year over year to $25.53 billion, while net income jumped 53% to nearly $11 billion. This growth was driven by explosive demand for its 3nm and 5nm nodes, which together contributed nearly 58% of total wafer revenues.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s first-quarter EPS also jumped 53.6% to $2.12 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. The stock beat the consensus mark for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. QuoteTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is not only growing but also scaling at an unprecedented pace to capitalize on the AI-driven growing demand for advanced chips. The company is set to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, far outpacing its $29.8 billion investment in 2024. The bulk of this spending, around 70%, is focused on advanced manufacturing processes, ensuring TSM stays ahead of the curve.TSM Stock Trades at Attractive ValuationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.51, below the sector average of 23.84. This reasonable valuation, coupled with the company’s growth potential, offers an appealing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing also trades at a lower P/E ratio than other semiconductor players, including Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA trade at P/E ratios of 27.74, 20.95 and 24.8, respectively.Near-Term Risks Persist for TSMDespite its strengths, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing faces near-term headwinds. Higher energy prices in Taiwan, following a 25% electricity hike in 2024, pose a considerable challenge, especially as advanced nodes demand greater power.Softness in key markets like PCs and smartphones also dampens near-term prospects. These traditionally strong revenue drivers are projected to see only low single-digit growth in 2025, limiting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s growth despite rising AI demand.Additionally, rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are other concerns. These new facilities, while strategically important for diversification, are expected to dilute gross margins by 2-3% annually over the next three to five years due to higher labor and utility costs, coupled with lower initial utilization rates.Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, further cloud the outlook. With significant revenue exposure to China, export restrictions and supply-chain disruptions could pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s operations.Conclusion: Hold TSM Stock for NowTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s technological leadership and strategic investments make it a compelling long-term player in the semiconductor space. However, short-term challenges, including rising costs, tariff wars and geopolitical risks, warrant caution. For now, holding TSM stock remains the most prudent strategy, allowing investors to benefit from its industry leadership while navigating near-term uncertainties.Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Does Broadcom's Expanding Portfolio Make the AVGO Stock a Buy?,1747844580000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have surged 37.2% in the past month. The company is benefiting from an expanding portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business, strong balance sheet and impressive free cash flow. Broadcom has outperformed its closest semiconductor peers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Marvell Technology MRVL, shares of which have returned 35.6%, 32.6% and 21%, respectively, over the same time frame.AVGO Stock’s PerformanceBroadcom’s strategy of updating its portfolio on a frequent basis has been a key catalyst. The company is expanding its portfolio with the launch of its third-generation 200G per lane (200G/lane) Co-Packaged Optics product line. In April, Broadcom introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C) This follows March showcase of 200G/lane DSP and SerDes, 400G optics, and PCIe Gen6 over optics products at the 2025 Optical Fiber Communications Conference and Exhibition (OFC). Strong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. At OFC, Broadcom showcased the industry’s first 6.4-Tbps optics attach for XPU that enables high bandwidth, long-reach scale-up fabric connectivity for AI servers. AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.Do these initiatives make Broadcom stock a buy? Let’s find out.Solid Portfolio, Rich Partner Base to Boost AVGO’s ProspectsAVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies (DELL), Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Strong Liquidity Aids AVGO to be Shareholder FriendlyBroadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

This zero-day options craze could finally be coming to popular stocks like Nvidia and Tesla. Here's what to know.,1746543180000,"By Joseph AdinolfiNasdaq has asked the SEC for permission to list options tied to a handful of popular stocks that would expire on Mondays and WednesdaysAn earlier version of this story incorrectly named Scott Bauer's firm.A surge in trading of so-called ""zero days to expiry"" - or ""0DTE"" - options has contributed to an options-market boom over the past few years, drawing in both sophisticated investors and amateur speculators.During the trading week, investors have been limited to trading 0DTE contracts tied to stock-market indexes like the S&P 500 and a handful of popular ETFs, including the Invesco QQQ Trust.But after a long wait, they could soon be coming for popular stocks such as Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA)In a filing published late last week, Nasdaq Inc. officially asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to expand offerings of option contracts tied to a handful of individual stocks. If the SEC signs off, the exchange would be allowed to list options tied to a select group of stocks that expire on Mondays and Wednesdays, giving traders two more opportunities per week to trade option contracts on the edge of expiration.""It's probably been a long time in the making,"" Scott Bauer, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy and a former floor trader on a major options exchange, told MarketWatch.Currently, options tied to individual common stocks only expire on Fridays, while contracts tied to some stock-market indexes and highly liquid ETFs have more frequent expirations.Although a Nasdaq executive declined to comment on the exchange's plans, traders and industry experts who spoke with MarketWatch said that, if all goes well, contracts expiring on Tuesdays and Thursdays could soon follow.""They're not pure 0DTEs in the sense that they're not listed every day, but it's getting pretty close,"" Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics, told MarketWatch.See: 2024 was another record-breaking year for options trading. What's on tap for the industry in 2025.What is a '0DTE' option?Any option due to expire at the end of a session is considered a 0DTE contract. Technically, every option becomes a 0DTE on the last day of its life.Traders who spoke with MarketWatch have said the appeal of these contracts lies in the small chance of an outsize gain. If the market pushes them into the money before they expire, it could lead to a large windfall for a trader who had bought them minutes or hours earlier.Back in 2022, popular exchange operators like Cboe Global Markets expanded offerings tied to the S&P 500 and a few popular ETFs to allow traders to trade 0DTE contracts every day of the trading week. The change helped accelerate a boom in options trading that had begun shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic.The average daily trading volume in these extremely short-dated contracts has been climbing steadily since. 0DTE volumes in S&P 500 index options hit a record during the first quarter of 2025, according to Cboe data.A Cboe analyst estimated that roughly 50% to 60% of the average daily activity in S&P 500 0DTE contracts involves amateur individual investors, although the exact share is difficult to determine precisely.Their rise has coincided with a surge in activity across the broader U.S. equity-options market. According to the Options Clearing Corporation, the industry's main clearinghouse, more than 12 billion contracts changed hands in 2024, setting a record for the fifth year in a row.It appears another record could follow in 2025, with the industry already on track to top 14 billion contracts traded, according to Henry Schwartz, vice president of market intelligence at Cboe.'We're working closely with everybody'The SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny Nasdaq's request once the filing is published in the Federal Register, which had not yet happened as of Tuesday morning. A representative for the SEC didn't return a request for comment from MarketWatch.Once approved, these options could start trading within days.Nasdaq's decision to request the change was the culmination of a lengthy process by exchanges, brokerage platforms, market makers and other options-industry players. The goal was to figure out the best way to introduce more short-dated contracts tied to shares of individual stocks in a manner that would minimize risks for the industry and its customers.Ultimately, the exchange decided that Monday and Wednesday contracts wouldn't be listed on any day when the underlying company is due to report quarterly earnings. This should help to limit the chances that volatile swings in stocks after the closing bell could complicate trade settlements, a Nasdaq representative said.""We're working closely with everybody to make sure we're doing this in a safe and responsible way,"" said Greg Ferrari, a senior vice president at Nasdaq within the market platforms division.The changes proposed by Nasdaq would only allow Monday and Wednesday expirations for a handful of stocks and one additional ETF. As of January 2025, only contracts tied to Nvidia, Tesla, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Broadcom Inc. (AVGO), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) would be eligible for the Monday and Wednesday listings, along with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF XLF.'Lottery tickets'Options-market activity has been trending toward shorter-dated contracts for years, said OptionMetrics' DeSimone.At the same time, the advent of free-to-trade electronic brokerages has helped inspire a new generation of amateur individual investors to try their hand at options trading.Making it easier to trade 0DTE tied to individual stocks could accelerate both of these trends, DeSimone said. While institutional players still dominate index options, individual traders are more active in the single-stock space, DeSimone said.DeSimone cautioned that anybody interested in trading these products should keep their risk profile in mind. Some in the industry have likened 0DTE contracts to ""lottery tickets"" that offer a small chance of a large payout, and a high likelihood that the contract will expire worthless.JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America, parent of brokerage tastytrade, pushed back against this characterization, calling it hyperbolic. He said many investors trade 0DTE options as part of spread strategies involving more than one contract, allowing them to more precisely manage their risk.

CRDO vs. AVGO: Which AI-focused Semiconductor Stock is the Better Buy?,1747831440000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd. CRDO and Broadcom Inc. AVGO are semiconductor companies that specialize in high-speed connectivity solutions essential for AI-driven data centers.The data center market is undergoing rapid transformation as organizations accelerate their digital initiatives, including the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, along with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This surge in digital activity has resulted in explosive data growth, placing significant pressure on existing data center infrastructure. Consequently, there is a rising need for advanced data processing and storage solutions to support AI workloads. This trend presents strong growth opportunities for companies like Credo and Broadcom.So, now the question arises: Which stock makes a better investment pick at present? Let’s dive into the pros and cons for each company.The Case for CRDOCredo is gaining a strong market presence in both Ethernet and Active Electrical Cables (AECs) solutions specialized for data centers. AEC products experienced triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by their increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.Credo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. CRDO’s PCIe and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo for significant future revenue growth.Momentum in the optical business, particularly Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. It recently unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The Case for AVGOBroadcom is a diversified semiconductor company with a strong presence in AI chip development space. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. These hyperscalers are significantly ramping up investment in their next-generation frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators and AI data centers with larger clusters. AVGO noted that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Consequently, AVGO’s Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Apart from these three customers, AVGO is also working with four other hyperscalers to aid them in building their own customized AI accelerators.XPUs are necessary to train Generative AI (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. Its next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. AVGO is now planning to tape out the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.In the last reported quarter, semiconductor solutions revenues (55% of net revenues) totaled $8.2 billion, rising 11% year over year, driven by strong AI semiconductor revenues. AI-related revenues grew 77% year over year to $4.1 billion, which was a major driver of overall revenue growth. This growth was driven by higher shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers for AI applications.For second-quarter fiscal 2025, Broadcom expects revenues of $14.9 billion, while AI semiconductor revenues are projected to grow 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow 17% year over year to $8.4 billion.Price Performance and Valuation for CRDO & AVGOOver the past month, CRDO and AVGO have registered gains of 67.8% and 36.3%, respectively.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 15.50X, lower than AVGO’s 16.05X.How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for CRDO & AVGO?Analysts have kept their earnings estimates unchanged for CRDO’s bottom line in the past 90 days.Meanwhile, for AVGO, there is a marginal upward estimate revision.CRDO or AVGO: Which is a Better Pick?Both CRDO and MRVL are well-positioned to gain from the rapidly growing AI driven data center market. CRDO at present flaunts a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Consequently, in terms of Zacks Rank, AVGO seems to be a better pick at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:70a692c5f094b:0-crdo-vs-avgo-which-ai-focused-semiconductor-stock-is-the-better-buy/
Chip Shares Tumble After Nvidia Discloses Export Restrictions,1744810680000,"By Denny JacobExport restrictions placed on certain chips manufactured by Nvidia have weighed on other chipmakers, and shares of Broadcom, Qualcomm and others declined Wednesday.Nvidia, which has become a proxy for chipmakers given its booming valuation and chips powering artificial-intelligence capabilities, faces new hurdles. The chip company on Tuesday said it would record a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings and disclosed the U.S. will now require a license for exporting the company's H20 processors to China and other countries.Wedbush analysts said that, while the financial impact is relatively small, the requirement is a strategic blow to Nvidia going after the China market as a trade war develops between the U.S. and China.Investors appear to be betting that such restrictions mean greater risk to business operations to Nvidia and others, raising questions about their valuations and prospects in a scenario in which the two largest economies continue to impose levies against each other.Nvidia was down 6.8% to $104.56 in premarket trading. Broadcom declined 4.3% to $171.34, Qualcomm was off 2.9% to $134.64, and Micron Technology shed 5.7% to $67. Marvell Technology declined 5.1% to $50.62, and Advanced Micro Devices retreated 7.7% to $87.94.While announced tariffs have caused a broader selloff, companies in the technology space have faced particular challenges, as questions about valuations had been bubbling before the Trump administration announced tariffs. Uncertainty about the administration's approach and desired endgame have increased as tariffs have been announced and paused. While certain products, including electronics at large, have appeared to be exempted, definitive measures have changed over short periods.Write to Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250416004931:0-chip-shares-tumble-after-nvidia-discloses-export-restrictions/
Bull of the Day: Credo Technology (CRDO),1746523200000,"Credo Technology Group (CRDO) is a key supplier of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the hyperscale datacenter, 5G carrier, enterprise networking, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI/ML markets.Credo is located in the center of the AI revolution in San Jose, CA.With sales growing 120% this fiscal year to $425 million, one of Credo's high demand products is their line of Active Electrical Cables (AEC) which provide high-speed connectivity solutions to data centers and enterprises with heavy AI and cloud computing needs.Credo also makes Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chipsets to facilitate high-bandwidth data transfer with low energy usage.Credo's largest and most strategic customers are leading hyper-scalers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon who use Credo's AECs to support AI and cloud infrastructure.And its biggest competition comes from Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) in connectivity solutions for the AI Economy.NVIDIA is the AI Market MakerAs I've said for almost eight years, Jensen & Co. have been creating new industries we didn't even know we needed. Once modern data enterprises and research universities caught on to what GPU-CUDA ""massively parallel architectures"" could do for them, they literally created new uses cases by the thousands per year.When you can simulate anything, use synthetic data to do so, and then run billions of iterations on your experimental idea in a matter of hours, innovation happens much faster.Thus Jensen talks about 1,000-fold advances in science, engineering, and social challenges. And then you understand why NVIDIA (NVDA) power tools are in such demand for the Global 2000 corporations, plus universities, plus nation-states who need to secure and ""mine & model"" their own data.In my NVIDIA (NVDA) ""Top Picks"" video on April 21, I compared the new Huawei supercomputer offering to NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72.And one of my points of focus was on the high-speed, low-latency connectivity required for these new rack-scale architectures. I didn't mention Credo, but I'm very curious about how closely they are working together since Jensen likes that ""copper is cheaper"" and perfectly still useful for direct connections between GPUs in racks.A Fly in the AnointmentThis all sounds great for Credo going forward, especially as they are projected to grow EPS this fiscal year by a whopping 600%!But the stock was richly valued before their Q3 FY2025 (ended April) report. Right now at an $8 billion market cap on forward sales of over $500 million, they are conservatively trading over 16X sales.By early March when they reported, CRDO shares had been cut in half from $80 to $40 in just a month just to get back down to earth at 16X sales. So it's safe to say they were trading near 30X sales in Q1 near the stock highs above $80.Part of the big pessimism -- or realism -- even before the trade war tumult, was that Credo's Q3 38% EPS beat and giant 12.5% revenue beat was built around a single large customer who may have contributed as much as 85% of that topline: Amazon.While they didn't disclose Amazon (AMZN) as the big kahuna in their operations, many analysts had sufficient reason to suspect this was the case.""As we shared last quarter, we had seven customers that contributed more than 5% of revenue,"" said Credo Chief Financial Officer Dan Fleming. ""And going forward, we expect that three to four customers will be greater than 10% of revenue in the coming quarters and fiscal year, as additional hyperscalers ramp to more significant volumes.""I think Credo can keep growing and we won't see another quarter so dependent on one large company.What Makes Credo's AECs More Efficient Than Other Cables?Credo's Active Electrical Cables (AECs) stand out for their efficiency and performance in modern data center environments, especially compared to traditional Direct Attached Copper (DAC) and Active Optical Cables (AOC). Here are the key factors:1. Substantial Power SavingsCredo’s AECs consume about 50% less power than traditional DACs and significantly less than AOCs, making them highly energy efficient.For example, their second-generation HiWire LP SPAN AECs reduce power consumption by nearly half while increasing cable reach by 40% compared to the previous generation.2. Thinner, More Flexible CablesCredo’s AECs use thinner copper (as slim as Cat 6 cables), reducing cabling volume by up to 75% compared to passive DACs. This makes them easier to route and manage in dense data center environments.The thinner, lighter cables also support longer distances and tighter bend radii, which is critical for modern rack-to-rack and server-to-switch connections.3. Superior Performance and ReliabilityIntegrated digital signal processors (DSPs) and retimers in Credo’s AECs deliver better signal integrity, enabling higher data rates (up to 800G and 1.6T) over longer distances without degradation.These cables offer extreme reliability, with Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) ratings up to 100 million hours, minimizing downtime and maintenance.4. Plug-and-Play SimplicityCredo’s AECs are hot-swappable and easy to deploy, providing a drop-in replacement for AOCs and DACs without the need for additional components or complex configuration.They also support advanced features like dual Top-of-Rack (TOR) redundancy for enhanced reliability in hyperscale data centers.5. Lower Environmental ImpactBy reducing power consumption and using less plastic and copper, Credo’s AECs help customers decrease their environmental footprint.Relentless Connectivity Innovation for AINow that you know Credo's key ""connector"" role in the AI economy, let me highlight recent press releases that you should go find on their website if you are interested in learning more...March 18: Credo and XConn to Showcase Seamless GPU Cluster at NVIDIA GTCMarch 26: Credo to Showcase AI Scale Out Fabric Featuring Credo Optical DSPs at OFC 2025March 27: Credo Named a Winner of the 2025 Top Workplaces USA AwardApril 1: Credo Unveils the Lark Family - Setting a New Benchmark for Low-Power 800G Optical DSPsIf their innovation cadence maintains like this, I'm sure their big customer wins will keep growing.

While the stock is off to a rough start for Q1, his description of their business was exceptional so I want to share it for your own due diligence...Credo aims to break bandwidth barriers in the data infrastructure market. It provides secure, high-speed connectivity solutions that deliver improved power efficiency as data rates and corresponding bandwidth requirements increase exponentially throughout the data infrastructure market.Specifically, Credo’s SerDes and DSP chips optimize data transfer by enabling high-speed, error-free communication within data centers, while its HiWire Active Electrical Cables (AECs) provide efficient, high-bandwidth connections between servers to support AI workloads and large-scale data processing.Many important trends are driving the data infrastructure market, such as cloud workloads, streaming video, 5G wireless deployment, the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), and, most notably, the growing adoption of artificial intelligence. These trends have all created an explosion of data that has stressed existing infrastructure and forced a major shift.(end of Sheraz Mian observations)The rapid adoption of AI and the need for efficient data center connectivity are driving increased demand for Credo’s products among top-tier builders of the AI Economy.Credo is expanding its customer base to include all the major technology firms -- from Apple to Tesla -- and multiple large enterprises in energy and education in the midst.Bottom line on CRDO: If Sheraz hadn't put Credo on my radar, I might not have studied it enough. Now that I know better, I think its a buy in the $40s.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d8dd6423c094b:0-bull-of-the-day-credo-technology-crdo/
"Nvidia's AI Chip Revenue to More Than Double to $262 Billion by 2030, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1747760100000,"By Tae KimTD Cowen is growing more optimistic about Nvidia's ability to dominate the surging AI chip market through the end of the decade.""We come away from our analysis more constructive on merchant [GPU] vendors over custom, and incrementally more confident in the depth and breadth of Nvidia's competitive positioning,"" the Cowen technology team wrote in a report Tuesday.TD Cowen forecasts the overall market for artificial-intelligence processors — chips such as graphics processing units — will grow from $117 billion in 2024 to $334 billion in 2030. The analysts estimate Nvidia will maintain 90% of the market for GPUs, with revenue from AI chips rising from $100 billion in 2024 to $262 billion in 2030.Skeptics have said Nvidia would eventually face tougher competition as large technology companies get help from Broadcom and Marvell Technology to make better custom AI chips. But over the time through the end of the decade, custom chips' share of the AI market will rise from 10% to just 15%, Cowen said.TD Cowen believes Nvidia will maintain its top position, saying custom AI chips will continue to offer less performance than Nvidia's chips by a ""healthy margin."" The chip maker also has the most mature offering of technology across hardware, software, and networking, it says.""We believe Nvidia's fully-integrated hardware system approach and robust software suite allow it to demonstrate superior performance in GenAI inference versus competitors,"" the analysts wrote.Competition from custom AI chips produced by Big Tech companies isn't a new story. Amazon Web Services launched its own custom AI chip in 2019, and Alphabet's Google introduced its AI accelerator back in 2015. Both companies have launched several successor versions, but Nvidia has thus far won most of the AI chip business.""We see Nvidia's leading technology portfolio, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments driving strong accelerator growth in the coming years,"" the analysts said.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Global chipmakers feel the pinch of Trump's shifting trade policy,1744808554000,"Global chip stocks were battered on Wednesday on fresh evidence of how U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting trade policy was complicating the outlook for semiconductor and computing giants, including AI pioneer Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and its rival AMD NASDAQ:AMD .Attempts to reorient global trade through tariffs and export curbs have started to show the effect as Nvidia warned of a $5.5 billion hit after Washington restricted exports of its AI processor tailored for China, while Dutch chip-making tools giant ASML raised doubts about its outlook. The U.S. restriction, which also hit the MI308 processor of Advanced Micro Devices, marked the latest blow for the AI chip trade that is losing steam after a two-year rally as tariff threats and fears over Big Tech's spending weigh on sentiment. Nvidia shares closed down nearly 7% on Wednesday, with the company losing more than $148 billion in market value. AMD fell 5.8% as it warned of a $800 million hit from the latest curb, while AI-related chip stocks including Arm NASDAQ:ARM , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and Micron NASDAQ:MU dropped between 2.5% and 4.6%.Nvidia said on Wednesday that it follows the U.S. government's directions on where it can sell its chips after the U.S. Commerce Department announced on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements for Nvidia's H20 chips.""The U.S. government instructs American businesses on what they can sell and where — we follow the government's directions to the letter,"" Nvidia said. ""The technology industry supports America when it exports to well-known companies worldwide - if the government felt otherwise, it would instruct us,"" the company added. Tightening U.S. export curbs have in recent years made it harder for American chipmakers to tap the Chinese market, but the country remains a key source of revenue. ""The U.S. export restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chips highlight the growing geopolitical uncertainty enveloping the tech and semiconductor sectors, particularly under Trump-era-style policy reversals,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital. ""This unpredictability rattles businesses and investment markets, as evidenced by Nvidia's selloff this morning and broader pressure across chip stocks."" Nvidia drew over 13% of its sales, or about $17 billion, from China in its last financial year, although that was down from 21% in fiscal 2023. For AMD, China was its second-largest market last year, accounting for more than 24% of total sales. ""The H20 portion was about $12 billion or so (of the total China revenue), roughly about 30 cents of earnings per share, not trivial but not enormous in the grand scheme of things,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""H20 performance is low, well below already-available Chinese alternatives; a ban essentially simply hands the Chinese AI market over to Huawei.""Rasgon said the move may have surprised many investors as shares had surged nearly 18% last week, partly due to a report that the Trump administration planned to back off from such a curb after CEO Jensen Huang attended a Mar-a-Lago dinner.The company had earlier this week unveiled plans to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, a move largely seen as an overture to Trump. Trump has for now exempted semiconductors and some other electronics from his tariffs, but he has warned that sector-specific levies will be announced in the coming weeks. Such tariffs could cost U.S. semiconductor equipment makers more than $1 billion a year, Reuters reported on Tuesday.NVIDIA FALLOUT News of the latest export curb on Nvidia sparked a selloff in chip companies and its suppliers across the globe. In South Korea, Samsung KRX:005930 closed down about 3%, while SK Hynix KRX:000660 closed 4% lower. European chipmakers ASM International EURONEXT:ASM and Infineon Technologies XETR:IFX fell more than 2%, while Japanese chip-testing equipment maker Advantest TSE:6857 - an Nvidia supplier - was the Nikkei's second-worst performer with a 5% tumble. Still, some analysts said Nvidia's overall sales have continued to surge even as the China contribution slows while chip demand remains strong from big cloud companies.""While we acknowledge the likely impact to near-term numbers, we would stress that Blackwell shipments to core hyperscale customers remains the driver of fundamentals,"" TD Cowen analysts said, referring to Nvidia's latest line of AI systems.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QU0U8:0-global-chipmakers-feel-the-pinch-of-trump-s-shifting-trade-policy/"
Nvidia Stock Falls. Here's What's Weighing on the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1746454380000,"By Adam Clark and Tae KimNvidia stock was falling on Monday as investors assess Big Tech spending on its processors and balance that against potential restrictions on the chip maker's exports.Shares were down 0.7%, at $113.71, in early trading. The stock rose 2.6% on Friday.Nvidia stock rose more than 5% over the past five trading sessions and 17% in the past month, helped by technology companies Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.com all repeating their intention to invest heavily in artificial-intelligence infrastructure, which includes Nvidia's chips.However, Nvidia could be facing a 20% reduction in the long-term $500 billion total addressable market for its hardware from U.S. restrictions on its exports, according to BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya.""China is about half of this, based on China's direct contribution to global cloud capex. The other 10 [percentage] points is variable and will depend on how strictly the U.S. administration implements AI diffusion rules,"" Arya wrote in a research note.Arya kept a Buy rating and $150 target price on Nvidia stock.In April, Nvidia disclosed that future sales of its H20 AI accelerators to China would require a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is generally viewed as unlikely to be granted.Nvidia is now working on the design of its AI chips in order to make a processor that can be exported to China under U.S. restrictions as soon as June, technology-focused news outlet The Information reported over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment on the report.On Monday, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar also quantified the ""worst case"" scenario if Nvidia's top data center customers cut back on spending because of a difficult economic environment over the next year.Kumar estimates 6.5% of the chip maker's data-center revenue — worth about 40 cents of earnings per share — would be lost. Using a 25 times earnings multiple, the stock's downside price would be $76.25.On the flip side, Kumar figures the upside scenario would lead to a price of $177.45.Trading was mixed for two other chip makers.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Moody's, Broadcom, Microsoft and CoreWeave",1747743960000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 20, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Moody's MCO, Broadcom AVGO, Microsoft MSFT and CoreWeave CRWV.U.S. Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech BoomsIn poker, a ""tell"" is a player's subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, ""If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?""Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market's resilient reaction to the Moody's downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Market Chatter: Intel Considers Divesting Networking, Edge Businesses",1747733728000,"Intel NASDAQ:INTC has contemplated selling its network and edge businesses, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter. The chipmaker is considering a potential sale because the businesses in its former NEX group no longer seem relevant to the focus that Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan has adopted for the company, two sources told the news agency. The unit will no longer help Intel's core strategy, Reuters reported, citing a source. The company may sell its networking business because Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and other firms have a tight grip on key parts of that market, according to the report. Intel has not yet launched a formal deal process for the unit, or solicited bidders, Reuters reported, citing two sources. The company recently interviewed investment bankers to pick an adviser for the sales process, though it has not yet hired a banker, according to the report. Intel didn't immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250520:A3381640:0/

(Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar)Astera Labs, Inc. Stock Price and EPS SurpriseAstera Labs, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Astera Labs, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Have Influenced Q1 PerformanceAstera Labs’ first-quarter 2025 revenues are likely to have benefited from increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers and data center infrastructure. Strong momentum across its three key product families, Aries, Taurus, and Leo, is likely to have contributed well. The Aries peripheral component interface express (PCIe) retimers and Taurus Ethernet product lines are expected to have driven significant revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. With continued adoption across AI platforms and general-purpose compute systems, these products are likely to have sustained high demand in the first quarter. Revenues from Taurus 400 gig Ethernet solutions are expected to have contributed significantly to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by both AI and general-purpose compute infrastructure applications.The expansion of the Scorpio Smart Fabric Switch family, which is already generating preproduction shipments, is expected to have contributed positively in the first quarter.ALAB Stock Underperforms Sector and IndustryALAB shares have plunged 45.1% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s decrease of 8.9% and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s decline of 15.2%. The underperformance can be attributed to concerns over the lower-than-expected gross margin driven by a shift in product mix toward hardware-based solutions. Along with this, a broader market weakness in the tech sector and persistent fear over mounting tariffs by the current government have added to the pressure.YTD ALAB Stock PerformanceALAB Stock is Currently OvervaluedALAB stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, ALAB is trading at 15.36X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector’s 5.71X.Price/Sales Ratio (Forward 12 Months)ALAB Benefits From Expanding PortfolioALAB’s expanding portfolio is expected to have been a key catalyst. The company recently announced the ramp-up of production for its purpose-built PCIe6 connectivity portfolio, which includes gearbox solutions, fabric switches, retimers, and active cable modules. It aims to enhance the performance, scalability, and efficiency of AI and cloud infrastructure systems while supporting longer-distance connectivity with optical media for advanced AI platforms. Benefits from this announcement are likely to have been reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.ALAB’s expanding portfolio is expected to have helped it fend off competition from other industry players like Broadcom AVGO, which is also making strong efforts in the PCIe Retimer market.In February 2025, Broadcom announced the availability of its end-to-end PCIe Gen6 portfolio, advancing AI infrastructure solutions through successful interoperability testing with Micron and Teledyne LeCroy.Additionally, Broadcom’s introduction of scalable, high-performance, and low-power 400G PCIe Gen 5.0 Ethernet adapters aims to transform data centers by resolving connectivity bottlenecks.ALAB Powers AI Advancements With Top ChipmakersAstera Labs has made a significant impact on the AI industry with collaborations with top chipmakers, including NVIDIA NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology, and Intel. This is likely to have driven growth during the first quarter.ALAB recently introduced its Scorpio Smart Fabric Switches for PCIe 6-ready NVIDIA Blackwell-based MGX platforms, delivering high-performance, modular scalability for AI and cloud infrastructure.With comprehensive design-in collateral and interoperability validation in its Cloud-Scale Interop Lab, ALAB enhances NVIDIA MGX platform integration by optimizing GPU utilization, improving energy efficiency, and enabling advanced rack-level management through its COSMOS software.Advanced Micro Devices also continues to utilize Astera Labs solutions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of its AI-driven products. The partnership between Advanced Micro Devices and Astera Labs strengthens both companies’ positions in the AI market, fueling advancements in next-gen technologies.Conclusion: Hold ALAB Stock for NowDespite a strong product portfolio, ALAB faces increasing competition in the AI and cloud markets, particularly from larger semiconductor companies that are ramping up their product offerings for AI infrastructure. This competition is expected to hurt the company’s financial performance. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainties and stretched valuations are concerns.Astera Labs currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

"US Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech Booms",1747682700000,"US Stocks Brush Aside Moody’s DowngradeIn poker, a “tell” is a player’s subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody’s ( MCO ) credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, “If bad news can’t bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?”Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics Present BeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.Image Source: BeSpoke Investment Group The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom ( AVGO ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and CoreWeave ( CRWV ) shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there’s anything baseball’s steroid era taught, it’s that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China. Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950 S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Image Source: Carson Investment ResearchBottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market’s resilient reaction to the Moody’s downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:bf8993135094b:0-us-stocks-brush-off-moody-s-echo-past-tech-booms/
ONTO Slides 13% in a Month: How Should Investors Play the Stock?,1744804860000,"Onto Innovation ’s ONTO shares have lost 12.8% in the past month, which is narrower than the Nanotechnology industry’s decline of 14.2%. Over the same time frame, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 composite have registered declines of 6.7% and 4.9%, respectively. Escalating trade tensions and tariff troubles have been a drag on the overall market performance. Price performanceONTO stock inched up 0.3% in the last trading session and closed at $120.47. The stock is trading 50% below its 52-week high of $238.93, reached on July 16, 2024. When a stock is trading much below 52-week high, it can either be a golden opportunity or a value trap. Investors looking to invest or already holding the stock must be contemplating how to play ONTO stock given its low price relative to 52-week high.Let us understand the company’s fundamentals and ascertain the best course of action for your portfolio.ONTO’s Growth DriversAs the complexity of leading devices is rapidly increasing, manufacturers and fabless companies need better ways to measure physical features such as film thickness and feature sizes. Equipped with a best-in-class suite of semiconductor materials, Onto Innovation is focused on process control and well positioned to capitalize on almost every aspect of the semiconductor industry, including 5G, 3D NAND and advanced packaging.The industry's transition to 3D NAND is helping the company to further expand the available market. To strengthen its foothold, Onto launched innovative products in 2024 designed to support next-generation 3D interconnect technology and inspection tools for unpatterned wafers, panel-level packaging and compound semiconductors.Onto Innovation delivered a strong performance throughout 2024, with the fourth quarter being its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. AI-driven semiconductor packaging is a rapidly growing market and Onto Innovation has capitalized on this emerging trend with cutting-edge solutions. The 180% year-over-year growth in AI-packaging revenues for 2024 highlights robust demand for Onto’s metrology and inspection tools. AI packaging was Onto's top market for the quarter, fueled by significant growth in shipments supporting 2.5D Logic packaging.Advanced nodes continue to drive Onto Innovation’s revenue growth. Driven by four consecutive quarters of growth in this segment, ONTO projects momentum to persist in 2025 as well. During the fourth quarter, both logic and memory gained traction, with the maximum increase in gate-all-around revenues nearly doubling from the previous quarter.In addition to the growth of Atlas OCD tools, demand for Iris film metrology rose, driven by successful qualifications in memory, logic and packaging, bringing annual revenues close to $100 million. ONTO expects continued demand for Iris films in 2025 with the expansion of its customer base and market footprint.Power revenues increased 10% in 2024, despite weak end-market demand led to delays in several customer expansions. As the demand for power usage elevates among data centers, ONTO is focused on developing advanced gallium nitride-based power semiconductors that are gaining traction due to their advantages in power efficiency, compact size and higher density compared with silicon.For 2025, management expects total revenues in this segment to surpass the record set in 2024. It anticipates a seasonal dip in the first quarter, followed by rise in the subsequent quarters, aligning with the growth trends seen in 2024. In support of a $69 million volume purchase deal with a top DRAM manufacturer, management forecasts strong revenue growth in DRAM in the first quarter. Followed by a solid fourth-quarter performance, gate-all-around demand is expected to rise, while increased NAND orders are likely to support expansion and the growing need for high-stack 3D NAND.Given these drivers, management expects revenues in the range of $260-$274 million for the first quarter of 2025. Non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be between $1.40 and $1.54.Challenges Loom for ONTONon-GAAP operating expenses totaled $68.4 million, up 21.4% year over year. The metric reached the upper end of the guidance on higher R&D investments throughout the quarter. While R&D is crucial for long-term competitiveness, the increasing expense base could weigh down on profitability, especially if revenue growth stalls or macro conditions worsen.Uncertain macro backdrop and escalating geopolitical/trade tensions could upset supply chains and impact the semiconductor industry. This does not bode well for ONTO.Intense competition in the semiconductor vertical and forex volatility are additional concerns.Analysts remain cautious, as witnessed in the downward earnings estimate revision activity over the past 60 days.ONTO’s Expensive ValuationONTO stock is trading at a premium with forward 12-month price/earnings multiple of 18.03X compared with the industry’s 3.70X. Conclusion: Hold ONTO for NowWhile Onto Innovation has strong structural tailwinds, its near-term investment profile is clouded by uncertain global macro backdrop, geopolitical and trade tensions along with intense competition. Increasing operating costs also emerge as a concern.Therefore, we believe new investors should wait for a better entry point and existing investors should retain ONTO stock, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth consideration in the broader technology space are Broadcom AVGO, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and NETGEAR Inc NTGR. While AVGO flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), CSCO and NTGR presently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.

Buy 5 Big AI Laggards of Q1 That Found Wings and Soared Past Month,1747659600000,"U.S. stock markets closed first-quarter 2025 on a negative note after two years of an impressive bull run. The technology sector, particularly artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, suffered the most following the Fed’s ambiguity about further lowering interest rates anytime soon and the fear of a near-term recession. In the first half of second-quarter 2025, Wall Street remained more volatile due to the Trump administration’s tariffs and trade policies, as well as their impact on the U.S. economy, particularly on an already elevated inflation rate.Despite this headwind, several AI stocks that lagged in the first quarter have flourished in the past month. Here, we recommend five such AI stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful in the near term. These stocks are: AppLovin Corp. APP, Amphenol Corp. APH, Arista Networks Inc. ANET, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Twilio Inc. TWLO. These stocks have strong revenue and earnings growth potential for 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

Global chip stocks slide as Nvidia warns of big hit from U.S. export curbs,1744801203000,"Global chip stocks slumped on Wednesday after Washington curbed exports of an AI chip Nvidia had tailored for China, further cutting off the crucial growth market for semiconductors in a move that will cost the AI pioneer $5.5 billion in charges.Nvidia said the charges it would incur is a result of U.S. restricting the export of its H20 AI chip to China, along with AMD's NASDAQ:AMD MI308 and their equivalents. The export curbs to China have in recent years squeezed U.S. companies, but the country remains a crucial revenue source with Nvidia drawing more than 13% of its sales, or some $17 billion, from China in its last fiscal year.Meanwhile, ASML EURONEXT:ASML , the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, cautioned that tariffs were adding to the uncertainty for its outlook for 2025 and 2026, sending its shares down over 4%.""We are not surprised that there are limits to H20...but the constraint there is supply, so a more sudden reduction in H20 - and given the inventory writedown, a higher revenue expectation going forward for H20 - will likely be disruptive to revenue and earnings,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said. Shares of Nvidia were down 5%, AMD dropped over 6%, while Micron Technology NASDAQ:MU , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO and Intel NASDAQ:INTC fell between 2% to 4% in premarket trading.Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein analyst, said banning the H20 Chip 'makes no sense' as it would hand over the Chinese AI market to rivals Huawei.U.S. officials have been aiming to prevent the sale of critical chip to China in an effort to maintain a competitive edge in the AI race.""The impact of a full H20 wipeout is probably (about)30 cents or so at current levels (not enormous in the grand scheme of things),"" Rasgon said.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QU0Q5:0-global-chip-stocks-slide-as-nvidia-warns-of-big-hit-from-u-s-export-curbs/"
Broadcom and JinkoSolar have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,1746188580000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 2, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Broadcom AVGO as the Bull of the Day and JinkoSolar JKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ford F, Tesla TSLA and General Motors GM .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Broadcom manufactures and sells semiconductors that are used in a range of technology products, such as smartphones, AI data centers, and the automotive industry, to name a few. Semiconductor solutions accounted for roughly 60% of 2024 revenues.AI-Related CapEX Remains StrongWhile the names of companies may come and go, and each moment in history on Wall Street is unique, every bull cycle has an underlying theme. That is, one growth industry that drives so much growth that it can lead the market up and down. For instance, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the key industry was railroads. The innovation was so novel and game-changing that it produced the most growth, profits, and speculation. The late 1990s saw the internet craze lead the US stock market higher and ultimately lower.Today, that industry is artificial intelligence. Grand View Research predicts that the global AI market will balloon to more than $1.8 trillion over the next five years, racking up a compound annual growth rate of ~35%. CapEx, or Capital Expenditure spending mostly from America’s cash-rich big tech companies, is the key to determining AI growth and, thus, Broadcom’s potential earnings growth. As earnings season hits its stride, Broadcom and other big tech companies are receiving welcome news on the CAPEX front.Semiconductor RestrictionsRestrictions on sending semiconductors overseas are an equally big threat to the semiconductor business. Yesterday, the Trump White House eased some of those concerns when it said it is considering easing restrictions after Nvidiaand other semiconductor juggernauts pushed for rule changes.AVGO: Expect Big Earnings GrowthBroadcom benefits from robust demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Last year, AI revenues bolted 220% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that AVGO will grow 42.73% this quarter, and 35.52% for full-year 2025.Broadcom Announces Massive Buyback ProgramDuring last quarter’s earnings conference call, AVGO management announced a massive $10 billion buyback. Share buybacks are bullish because they reduce the supply of stock available in the market, often leading to higher share prices.AVGO is a Perennial EPS WinnerAVGO has not missed Wall Street estimates in at least 5 years.Bottom LineFueled by explosive AI growth, strong CapEx spending from tech giants, and a gigantic share buyback program, Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on the AI revolution.Bear of the Day:Zacks Rank #5 stock JinkoSolar is a Chinese manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules and energy systems. JinkoSolar builds a vertically integrated solar product through its supply chain, which is recovered from silicon materials or solar modules. The company’s primary products are silicon wafers, solar cells, and solar modules, which are all PV. JKS has residential, commercial, and utility scale projects globally and is focused on sustainability and clean energy innovation.Tariff Wars Lead to Uncertainty for Chinese Solar IndustryWith the intensifying trade war between the United States and China, uncertainty abounds on Wall Street. The Trump administration’s attempt to negotiate bilateral trade deals globally has sparked heated rhetoric, tit-for-tat threats and tariffs, and uncertainty on Wall Street. Though it appears that the Trump team has made progress with some countries, China and the United States remain miles apart.For instance, over the past few days, the Trump team has claimed that talks are being held between the two adversaries, while the Chinese government has denied such claims. Meanwhile, Trump officials such as Treasury Scott Bessent say that a deal with China could take as long as two or three years.For years, President Trump has alleged that China is “dumping cheap product” on the United States and other countries. It’s not just right-leaning politicians saying this, either. In 2024, then-Treasury Secretary Jant Yellen warned that China is treating the global economy as a dumping ground for cheap, clean energy products. In other words, the Chinese government subsidizes clean energy companies so that their prices are artificially low, putting local companies out of business.When those companies exit the market, the Chinese companies hike prices. In response to this threat, Trump has set solar tariffs as high as 3,521% in Asia! While this is likely a positive for US solar companies like First Solarand Tesla , it essentially means that the US market is non-existent to companies like JinkoSolar.JKS Earnings Are Likely to SlideWall Street analysts are incredibly bearish on Jinko’s future and expect EPS to crater 453.85% this year!JKS Is a LaggardJKS shares exhibit relative price weakness and are down 28.2% year-to-date, dramatically underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Meanwhile, shares are stuck below the key moving averages and are carving out a bear flag structure.Bottom LineJinkoSolar, a major Chinese manufacturer of solar PV products, faces several bearish headwinds due to trade tensions between the US and China.Additional content:Buy, Sell or Hold Ford Stock Ahead of Q1 Earnings?Ford is slated to release first-quarter 2025 results on May 5, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s EPS and automotive revenues is pegged at breakeven and $35.5 billion, respectively.The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has moved up by 2 cents over the past seven days. In the year-ago period, the company reported EPS of 49 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests an 11% decline from the year-ago quarter’s figure.For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for F’s automotive revenues is pegged at $162.3 billion, suggesting a decline of 6% year over year. The consensus mark for full-year EPS is $1.22, calling for a 33.7% year-over-year contraction.In the trailing four quarters, this U.S. legacy automaker surpassed EPS estimates on two occasions, missed once and matched on the other, with the average earnings surprise being 1.21%.Ford Motor Company price-eps-surprise | Ford Motor Company QuoteQ1 Earnings Whispers for FOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Ford this time around. The combination of a positiveEarnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That’s not the case here.

The company’s sales declined 1.3% in the to-be-reported quarter to 501,291 units. The drop was mainly due to the timing of rental fleet sales and the discontinuation of the Ford Edge and Transit Connect. However, retail sales grew 5% during the quarter. Sales of Ford’s electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, jumped 25.5% to 73,623 units.Tesla was another auto biggie that saw its deliveries drop in the quarter under discussion. It delivered 336,681 EVs, which fell 13% year over year. Meanwhile, Ford’s closest peer General Motors sold 693,363 units in the first quarter of 2025, up 17% year over year.Ford had notified on its last earnings call itself that the company will sell fewer internal combustion engine vehicles compared to 2024. Additionally, a shift in product mix and foreign exchange headwinds will drag profits.Ford had guided breakeven adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2025, marking a sharp drop from $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to lower volumes, a 20% production cut and plant launch activities.Here’s a rundown of the estimates for Ford’s revenues and EBIT for key segments for the three months ended March 31.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford Blue unit (comprising ICE and hybrid models) is pegged at $17.6 billion, implying a decrease of 19% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBIT is $275 million, down from $905 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford model e unit (comprising of electric vehicles) is pegged at $1.5 billion, compared with $115 million in the corresponding period in 2024. The consensus mark for the segment’s loss before interest and taxes is $1.17 billion, narrower than $1.32 billion in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Ford Pro unit (encompassing commercial vehicles and services) is pegged at $16.2 billion, implying a decline of 10% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s EBIT is $1.5 billion, suggesting a decline from $3 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2024.F’s Price Performance & ValuationYear to date, shares of Ford have inched up 1.1%, outperforming the industry. It has also performed better than Tesla and General Motors, whose shares have plunged 30% and 15%, respectively, so far in 2025.From a valuation perspective, Ford is trading relatively cheap. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.24, below the industry’s 2.37. The company has a Value Score of A. Meanwhile, Tesla looks too pricey at a forward sales multiple of 8.57, whereas General Motors’ P/S sits at 0.25.How to Play Ford Pre-Q1 EarningsFord is indeed facing challenges. Widening EV losses, weakening ICE performance and auto tariffs threaten margins and earnings. Its 2025 outlook is soft and doesn’t even account for tariffs. Full-year adjusted EBIT is forecast at $7-$8.5 billion, down from $10.2 billion in 2024. Warranty costs and generous incentives will weigh on margins and overall profitability. However, not all is gloom and doom.The combination of Ford Pro's strong order books, increasing demand signals and the successful launch of the all-new Super Duty sets the stage for a highly promising future for the Ford Pro segment. While the 2025 EBIT guidance for the segment implies a year-over-year decline, it is still expected to be the major profit driver for the company. Additionally, Ford’s high dividend yield of roughly 6% is quite appealing to income-focused investors. The company targets a payout ratio of 40-50% of free cash flow, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder returns. Ford’s strong liquidity position provides a cushion, with $28 billion in cash and around $47 billion in total liquidity at the end of 2024.So, all in all, it is worth holding on to Ford stock now. However, investing ahead of its upcoming results doesn’t seem a good idea. It’s better to wait for management’s commentary on tariffs and updated 2025 guidance to see the potential impact.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

"Top semiconductor lab imec eyes 'programmable' AI chips, CEO says",1747650923000,"The CEO of imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has said the industry needs to steer towards reconfigurable chip architectures if it wants to avoid becoming a bottleneck for the future generations of artificial intelligence.Rapid AI algorithm innovation outpaces the current strategy of developing specific, raw-power-focused chips, leading to major drawbacks in energy, cost and hardware development speed, CEO Luc Van den hove said in a statement seen by Reuters ahead of its publication.""There is a huge inherent risk of stranded assets because by the time the AI hardware is finally ready, the fast-moving AI software community may have taken a different turn,"" he said.Some, like OpenAI, have taken the path of building custom chips to speed up innovation. However, such a move would be risky and uneconomical for most, Van den hove said.The research and development firm based in Leuven, Belgium pioneers many semiconductor breakthroughs that chipmakers like TSMC TWSE:2330 and Intel NASDAQ:INTC often widely adopt years down the line.As the AI industry moves beyond large language models to agentic AI and physical AI for medical or autonomous driving applications, Van den hove sees future chips regrouping all necessary capabilities into building blocks called supercells.""A network-on-chip will steer and reconfigure these supercells so they can be quickly adapted to the latest algorithm requirements,"" Van den hove said.This will require true three dimensional stacking, a manufacturing technique where layers of logic and memory silicon are bonded together, he added.Belgium-based imec was a significant contributor to the advancement and refinement of 3D stacking, a technology that will be featured in TSMC's A14 and Intel's 18A-PT future nodes.The R&D firm will hold its flagship conference, ITF World, on Tuesday and Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L8N3RO0NS:0-top-semiconductor-lab-imec-eyes-programmable-ai-chips-ceo-says/"

Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals — Barrons.com,1747634400000,"By Tae KimAmid the gold rush to build data centers and AI models, Nvidia has sold the most sought-after tools, driving triple-digit annual sales growth and turning the company into a $3 trillion market value giant.For the most part, Nvidia sells a ""full-stack AI solution"" that includes computer processors, or CPUs, networking equipment, and the AI accelerator, also known as the GPU. It's inside an Nvidia-designed server rack. Together, these components helped to train and serve new AI models.But now Nvidia is taking a significant step toward opening its platform, allowing customers to bring their own CPU or AI chip. It offers the option for future Nvidia racks with, say, Nvidia and Qualcomm chips inside.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the move on Monday at the COMPUTEX trade show in Taiwan. The new system is called NVLink Fusion.""A tectonic shift is under way: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected — AI is being fused into every computing platform,"" Huang said. ""NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures.""Nvidia's current top-of-the-line GB200 NVL72 AI server rack system includes Nvidia Grace CPUs and Nvidia Blackwell GPUs.Initial NVLink Fusion AI chip partners include MediaTek, Marvell, and AIchip. Fujitsu and Qualcomm are the initial CPU partners.""With the ability to connect our custom processors to Nvidia's rack scale architecture, we're advancing our vision of high-performance, energy-efficient computing to the data center,"" Qualcomm Technologies CEO Cristiano Amon said in a press release.The open system means large cloud providers, which were locked out of Nvidia's ecosystem when using their own custom chips, can now mix their custom chips with Nvidia's sought-after technology.For Nvidia, it means the potential to fill more data centers with its server platform and to drive more revenue.There's one catch: Broadcom, which makes many of the custom AI chips for large tech companies, wasn't on Nvidia's initial partner list, though the company said more partners could be added in the future.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Growth Stocks Are the Place to Be After Microsoft and Meta Earnings — Barrons.com,1746121260000,"By Jacob SonenshineMicrosoft and Meta Platforms' robust earnings proved growth stocks are the place for smart investors to keep their money.Investors should own growth stocks beyond these two tech heavyweights, such as companies that supply the data centers critical for their operations, as well as software companies that are benefiting from a similar trend that Microsoft is enjoying.That's because the overall growth picture at Microsoft and Meta looks strong, and signals more spending on data-center products and software ahead. Both companies reported better-than-expected sales and earnings and offered solid guidance.Microsoft projects that its fastest-growing cloud product, Azure, will see second-quarter revenue growth to close to 35% year over year. The product includes artificial intelligence, which makes customers more efficient and is therefore priced higher than many of its other products. That's driving the company's guidance for total sales growth of about 14% in the current quarter.While analysts had begun to worry that software customers would scale back their technology budgets amid tariffs and an uncertain economic outlook, Microsoft's report proves companies have enough confidence to invest.Ultimately, software companies are growing faster — despite the economic backdrop — because their customers are shifting away from traditional ways of storing and analyzing data and toward the new, AI-enhanced offerings. Stock in Salesforce was up 1%, while Oracle shares rose 5%, and ServiceNow rose 1.5%.These stocks have room to rise more, as analysts expect these companies post continued earnings growth. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector Exchange-Traded Fund trades at just over 33 times expected earnings, in aggregate, for the coming 12 months, below its peak of 40 times in the past two years. Analysts are likely to revise Microsoft's — and potentially other software companies' — earnings forecasts higher.Meanwhile, Meta's guidance called for second-quarter sales of $44 billion, implying 13% year-over-year growth. Brands are continuing to increase their advertising spend on Instagram and Facebook, as the company reported strong user engagement, growth in ad impressions, and higher ad prices.That's why other internet and advertising-related names were up Thursday. Alphabet's stock gained 0.9%. The platforms that dominate people's time and attention are winning, as internet companies' AI investments are enabling them to show each user the right content and ads, moving more ad spending onto their platforms. Clearly, brands aren't pulling back on marketing budgets enough to derail this trend.Elsewhere, Pinterest was gaining over 3%, and Trade Desk up 1.5%.The other major positive from the earnings reports was capital investment. Meta said it would grow capital expenditures this year by just over 80% to about $64 billion at the midpoint of the range. That comes just after Alphabet said it, too, will grow capex by double-digits, in percent terms, to $75 billion. Microsoft wants to slow the rate of growth of its capital investments, but analysts still expect growth overall. These companies are building data centers to support their AI capabilities.This is key for all the companies that make products that build data centers. Shares Nvidia, which sees the majority of its sales come from datacenter customers, rose 4% Wednesday. Chip maker Broadcom, which also sells into datacenters, climbed just over 3%. Micron Technology, which is still ramping up its datacenter memory business, edged up just over 2%.Arista Networks, which sells switches to Microsoft and Meta, jumped more than 6%.Vertiv Holdings, which see the majority of its cooling and power equipment sales from datacenters, spiked almost 9%. Peer Eaton, which sees a little less of its revenue from datacenters, gained around 3%.As long as the datacenter and AI trend keeps growing, this laundry list of companies will continue to see earnings growth and stock gains.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

QCOM Unveils Advanced Snapdragon 7 Chipset: Should You Buy the Stock?,1747419780000,"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QCOM recently introduced the cutting-edge Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform. One of the significant improvements in the new platform is a 65% improvement in AI performance. This will ensure seamless support for various large language models, generative AI assistants and stable diffusion image generation on smartphones. A 30% faster GPU rendering will facilitate improved framerates and smoother gameplay. To improve the gaming experience, the company has included Snapdragon Elite Gaming features into the platform. 27% improvement in CPU performance will ensure seamless multitasking and enhanced system responsiveness.Qualcomm has been actively collaborating with major smartphone manufacturers to develop a solution tailored to their requirements. The newly launched solution has already gained solid market traction. Leading OEMs such as HONOR and vivo have already selected the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 Mobile Platform for their upcoming devices. Realme is also expected to adopt the new platform.The solution brings several multimedia capabilities. New camera capabilities include video super resolution, hardware electronic image stabilization and advanced image processing features. The 3GPP release 17 for 5G, along with support for WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0, ensures seamless connectivity. Moreover, support for Snapdragon Sound technology, including Qualcomm Expanded Personal Area Network technology, ensures premium wireless audio quality.Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 series is used primarily in mid-range smartphones. Availability of advanced camera capabilities, action-packed gaming and advanced on-device AI in the Snapdragon 7 series chip set will be a game changer for mid-range smartphone users.QCOM Rides on Portfolio Strength, Innovation and AI FocusThe company has ramped up its efforts to solidify its position in the rapidly growing AI domain. QCOM took the market by storm with the launch of the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI desktops and laptops. The chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs, Microsoft’s vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware.Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is heavily investing in advanced AI and 5G technologies to drive nationwide digital transformation. Qualcomm has positioned itself as a key player in that initiative. QCOM has joined forces with HUMAIN to develop AI data centers to deliver cloud-to-edge hybrid AI services. It has formed a partnership with Aramco Digital to support the development of advanced edge AI industrial IoT devices and end-to-end solutions. Qualcomm is also witnessing solid market traction in the automotive business. In second-quarter fiscal 2025, automotive revenues rose 59% to $959 million, driven by increased content in new vehicle launches with its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform.These developments suggest Qualcomm is moving beyond the smartphone industry by diversifying its portfolio and venturing into new high-growth verticals such as AI PC, AI data centers, automotive and edge AI industrial IoT technologies and solutions. Its strategy of continuous innovation and portfolio diversification will likely boost commercial prospects.Major Challenges for QCOMSamsung and Apple, Inc. AAPL, which have been major buyers of Qualcomm chips for several years, are now moving toward in-house chip development. Samsung has launched several mobile chips under its Exynos lineup, which are used in both the mid-range and premium smartphone segments. Apple has also introduced several chips for its smartphone and PC products. The company uses the A18 Pro chip for the iPhone 16 Pro series and the A18 for iPhone 16 models. Moreover, in the iPhone 16e model, Apple has replaced the Qualcomm modem previously used in iPhone 15 models with an in-house C1 modem. Such initiatives from long-standing customers are a major concern for Qualcomm.The company is also facing intense competition from MediaTek in the mid-range smartphone segment. In the network space, the company faces competition from Broadcom Inc. AVGO. Despite some major issues, Intel Corporation INTC continues to be the dominant player in the PC market. With innovative launches such as Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors, the company is gaining strong momentum in the AI PC domain. Despite enhanced power efficiency and connectivity of Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, Qualcomm has to match the seamless compatibility that Intel processors offer with existing software to gain a competitive edge. This is a complex endeavor.Qualcomm has an extensive presence in China. Sino-U.S. trade hostilities can significantly impact its operations. However, following negotiations, both the United States and China have decided to temporarily reduce tariffs. If they fail to reach a resolution within this period, tariffs may rise again. This will negatively impact QCOM’s operating margin.Price PerformanceQCOM shares have declined 21% over the past year against the industry’s growth of 20.7%. The company has outperformed Intel but underperformed relative to Broadcom. Intel has declined 32.7%, while Broadcom has surged 64.7%.Estimate Revision Trend of QCOMEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 0.34% to $11.8 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 has decreased 1.85% to $12.21. This portrays mixed sentiments about the stock’s growth potential from investors.End NoteQualcomm intends to be the driving force in the next wave of AI innovations. The company’s effort to broaden its market reach beyond the mobile chipset market is an important step toward that direction. The future of AI innovation is not concentrated in a particular sector, but it is dispersed across a vast ecosystem. Hence, Qualcomm’s multi-dimensional approach is creating new revenue-generating opportunities in automotive, industrial IoT, data center, and edge AI domains while also strengthening its leadership position in the mobile chipset industry.However, aggressive competition in the smartphone chipset market and several of QCOM’s client strategy of in-house chip development are likely to hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. High exposure to the demanding environment of China is a major concern. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Qualcomm appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .TSM has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors Likely to Influence TSM’s Q1 ResultsTaiwan Semiconductor continues to assert its dominance in the semiconductor space, benefiting from a robust industry rebound fueled by the growing prominence of artificial intelligence (AI). The surge in AI-driven applications (in manufacturing and end products) has been a significant catalyst for chipset manufacturers like TSM. The rise of data-centric technologies, especially cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the metaverse, has increased the demand for semiconductors, contributing to the company’s business performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Taiwan Semiconductor’s consistent investments in next-generation and specialty technologies are likely to have driven growth in the first quarter. Its leadership in 7nm and 3nm chip technologies has been instrumental, offering advanced capabilities to customers in high-demand industries. The 5nm process technology has also contributed to TSM’s wafer revenues, reflecting the solid market adoption of these smaller, more efficient chipsets. Taiwan Semiconductor's strategic focus on ramping up 3nm production while advancing its 2nm development positions it for continued leadership in the semiconductor space.Taiwan Semiconductor's expansion into high-performance computing (HPC) and smartphone sectors is expected to have bolstered its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s innovative 3nm Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) technology, alongside its range of FinFET options (spanning 4nm, 5nm, 6nm and 7nm nodes), has become a key growth driver, particularly in HPC applications. TSM’s advanced FinFET technologies, such as the enhanced 3nm and plus variants of the 4nm and 5nm chips, have helped it maintain strong momentum in the smartphone market.Taiwan Semiconductor's technological advancements are anticipated to have supported its expansion into automotive, IoT and digital consumer electronics. The adoption of TSM’s multi-project wafer processing service, which helps customers cut costs, is likely to have boosted the company’s top-line growth. This diversification across industries enhances TSM’s resilience and offers multiple revenue streams.However, rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are likely to have hurt Taiwan Semiconductor’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, higher electric prices in Taiwan are anticipated to have negatively hurt its profitability in the first quarter.TSM Stock Price Performance & ValuationTaiwan Semiconductor shares have appreciated 10.6% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s rise of 7.5% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 3.3%. Compared to other major players in the semiconductor space, TSM stock has outperformed Marvell Technology MRVL and Micron Technology MU but underperformed Broadcom AVGO. Over the past year, Broadcom stock gained 33.7%, while shares of Marvell Technology and Micron Technology have plunged 23.8% and 42%, respectively.One-Year Stock Price PerformanceNow, let’s look at the value that Taiwan Semiconductor offers to its investors at the current levels. Currently, TSM is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 16.17X compared with the sector’s 22.41X.TSM Forward 12-Month P/E RatioTaiwan Semiconductor also trades at a lower P/E multiple compared with Broadcom’s 24.91X and Marvell Technology’s 17.95X. However, it has a way higher P/E multiple than Micron Technology’s 7.64X.Investment Thesis for TSM StockTaiwan Semiconductor’s planned capital expenditure of $38-$42 billion in 2025 highlights its commitment to maintaining technological superiority. Its ongoing development of 2nm process technology, promising up to 30% power savings over 3nm chips, is a testament to its focus on efficiency and innovation.Taiwan Semiconductor is also diversifying into high-growth sectors like automotive and the IoT. Automotive chips, driven by trends like electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving, now account for 4% of its revenues, while smartphone chips remain a significant 35%. These initiatives position TSM to capture emerging opportunities across industries.Despite its strengths, Taiwan Semiconductor faces near-term headwinds. Rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are a major concern. These new facilities, while strategically important for diversification, are expected to dilute gross margins by 2-3% annually over the next three to five years due to higher labor and utility costs, coupled with lower initial utilization rates.Higher energy prices in Taiwan, following a 25% electricity hike in 2024, pose additional challenges. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, further cloud the outlook. With significant revenue exposure to China, export restrictions and supply-chain disruptions could pressure Taiwan Semiconductor’s operations.What Should Investors Do With TSM Stock?Taiwan Semiconductor’s technological leadership and strategic investments make it a compelling long-term player in the semiconductor space. However, short-term challenges, including rising costs and geopolitical risks, warrant caution. Though the company has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates, it is prudent for investors to stay away from investing in the stock for now and wait for the upcoming quarterly results to get more clarity about its near-term prospects.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:3b3bb1ee3094b:0-taiwan-semiconductor-set-to-report-q1-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/
"Nvidia Stock Rises.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia and Broadcom",1747382280000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 16, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO.3 Reasons U.S. Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.The Nasdaq 100 Is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft , Apple , Nvidia and Broadcom have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative..786 Fibonacci & Previous ResistanceThe S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.In addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

"Broadcom: Buy, Hold, Sell? AI & Acquistions Paint Strong Picture",1746107280000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] For shareholders in the world’s second-largest  semiconductor company , Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , the last several years have borne incredible fruit. Over the past five years, Broadcom stock has provided a total return of approximately 690% as of the Apr. 30 close. The demand for the company’s AI data center infrastructure offerings may be second only to NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA .Its acquisition of VMware has given it an extremely powerful position in the virtualization market, and Broadcom has made VMware vastly more valuable.However, the huge run-up in the company’s share price begs the question: Can Broadcom sustain gains long-term? The company is trading for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 28x. This is around 38% higher than the forward P/E of the S&P 500 Index, which sits just above 20x.This suggests that the market may be overvaluing Broadcom. But is that really the case, and is Broadcom a buy, hold, or sell right now?This analysis will answer this question by breaking down Broadcom’s two main businesses: semiconductors and software.Broadcom’s Semiconductor Business: Sustaining Strong Growth Is Far From Out of the QuestionBroadcom stock has made most of its hay due to the rabid demand for AI-chips. Sales in this space have been growing at an incredibly fast pace. In 2024, AI-chips and networking solutions grew by 220% . In Q1 2025, the growth rate was 77%. Next quarter, the company sees 44% growth in AI for total AI revenue of $8.5 billion through the first half of 2025.So, growth rates are coming down, but what is the company forecasting?The company believes three hyperscalers will generate a serviceable addressable market (SAM) in AI of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. However, this is not the revenue the company expects to generate, only the size of the potential opportunity. Using the current expected sequential growth rate of 7% , Broadcom’s AI-chip business would be worth around $18 billion by the end of 2025. If it grows at a compound annual growth rate of 44% in 2026 and 2027, at the same rate it expects next quarter, the company’s AI revenue could reach $37 billion by 2027.This would mean it would need to capture about half of this SAM, at the midpoint. This would still be a tall task, but these numbers include only three customers. Overall, there is a significant chance Broadcom could sustain a powerful +40% AI growth rate for multiple years.The company also has a non-AI chip business that is almost as large as its AI-chip business. This business has been shrinking, and so has the non-AI chip industry overall. But, the semiconductor industry is cyclical, so there is a strong chance of a significant recovery.Broadcom’s Software Business Proves It's Not a One-Trick Pony [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] Some say Broadcom's massive growth in software isn’t impressive. They argue it only happened because Broadcom paid $69 billion for VMware. While that is somewhat true when comparing overall software revenues from 2023 to 2024, it is a vast oversimplification. VMware’s revenues came onto the books in Q1 2024, causing Broadcom’s software revenues to increase by 153% versus Q4 2023. However, with the company’s Q1 2025 earnings release, we can see how well Broadcom grew its software revenues organically. They did a fantastic job, with Broadcom increasing software sales by 47%.This is due to key changes the company has made at VMware, and it has more to achieve with VMware. It is still working to shift the remaining 40% of customers to its higher revenue subscription model.The VMware acquisition shows how good the company is at spotting and fixing struggling businesses. This has been part of the company’s playbook for years now. Once Broadcom reduces the massive debt load it took on from VMware, the firm could be in a great position to do so again.This possibility is another reason to be confident in Broadcom’s long-term chances of continuing to appreciate.Broadcom: Strong Outlook and Execution Point to Good Things on the HorizonThe moment when Broadcom was a generational investment might be gone, but the stock still shows great promise. The company’s path to continued and strong growth is not theoretical, but entirely possible.Also, management’s impressive ability to acquire and reinvigorate companies like VMware can create long-term opportunities that are not considered today.Yes, the stock trades at a high multiple, but for good reason. The 28x forward P/E ratio is not outrageous . For long-term growth, Broadcom remains a buy.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:c03bf33bd094b:0-broadcom-buy-hold-sell-ai-acquistions-paint-strong-picture/
Broadcom Introduces Industry’s First Incident Prediction Capability to Stop Living-Off-The-Land Attacks,1744722000000,"PALO ALTO, Calif., April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ:AVGO today announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats.Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries.“The inspiration for Incident Prediction came from how GenAI can ‘predict’ the next word when generating text,” said Eric Chien, Fellow, Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Broadcom. “By leveraging our extensive attack chain repository and threat intelligence using advanced AI and ML, Incident Prediction can predict the next four or five possible moves attackers will make in a customer’s environment, disrupt them, and then revert to normalcy right away. As a result, security analysts no longer need to triage the event to figure out mitigation strategies; Incident Prediction does that automatically for them.”With Incident Prediction, SOC analysts and other security professionals can:- Automate mitigation and disrupt attackers : Automatically identify the next steps that a specific attacker will most likely take based on past attack patterns. It then applies mitigation policies to block those predicted actions, disrupting most attacker’s progress before they can reach their end goal of encrypting data or exfiltrating information. - Reduce burden on SOC analysts: Eliminate the need for SOC analysts to manually triage alerts, analyze attack sequences and determine mitigation strategies. It handles this automatically, freeing up analysts to focus on other security priorities. - Avoid business impact: Incident Prediction provides specific granular attacker behaviors to block limiting impact to normal business processes. Common day, but crude mitigation measures, which disrupt business such as quarantining machines, shutting down the network, removing user access, or reimaging machines are largely unnecessary. - Reduce attack surface: Enhancing Symantec Adaptive Protection, which identifies and recommends blocking low-prevalence applications and behaviors to proactively shrink the attack surface. It helps close the “doors” to attackers and their common attack techniques.The use of legitimate software by cybercriminals, the approach used in LOTL attacks, is on the rise. According to “ Ransomware 2025: A Resilient and Persistent Threat ,” a new report by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, LOTL attacks are used by nearly all ransomware actors. Nation-state actors also use them to conduct surveillance or exfiltrate data. And large organizations are not the only victims – mid-market businesses increasingly are targeted. Instead of re-imaging the whole machine or changing everyone’s credentials when an attack is discovered, security professionals can use Incident Prediction to have more granular control over their security by blocking only the attacker’s most likely behaviors to reduce the risk of business disruption and enable a streamlined incident response – as attacks happen – all without additional cost.“Broadcom is focused on providing enterprise-grade security for all organizations, whether they have a mature SOC or a small security team. Incident Prediction delivers on this commitment – organizations can enhance SOC capabilities regardless of sophistication,” said Jason Rolleston, Vice President and General Manager, Enterprise Security Group, Broadcom. “Today, every organization needs to empower their security teams to become faster, stronger and more resilient against highly sophisticated APT groups. With Incident Prediction, they now have an automated system that can flag, act and help protect against cyberattacks – as they happen – faster and more cost-effectively.”See Us At RSAC™ 2025 ConferenceBroadcom is a Gold Sponsor of RSAC™ 2025 Conference, which will take place April 28 – May 1, 2025 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Broadcom will be demonstrating innovations from Symantec and Carbon Black at booth N-5345 in the North Expo. In addition, Broadcom executives will be speaking at the event.

Broadcom vs. Marvell: Which Semiconductor Stock Has Greater Upside?,1747324080000,"Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL are key providers of semiconductor solutions for end markets, including AI-powered data centers and cloud service providers. Both offer custom AI accelerators (XPUs) that power AI deployment. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expects a double-digit growth rate in 2025, with semiconductor sales surging 19.1% to $627.6 billion in 2024. This offers significant growth opportunities for both Broadcom and Marvell.However, both AVGO and MRVL have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions amid tariff-related uncertainties. While Broadcom shares have climbed a modest 0.1% year to date, Marvell shares plunged 40.3%.AVGO and MRVL Stock’s PerformanceSo, Broadcom or Marvell, which is a better buy amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop? Let’s find out.Broadcom Rides on Strong Demand for XPUsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.MRVL’s Growing Data Center and Networking Market is PositiveMarvell’s custom AI silicon and electro-optics solutions have enabled it to become a leading player in the high-performance computing space. The company is benefiting from hyperscalers’ ramping up their use of custom silicon for AI workloads. In fiscal 2025, AI-based revenues crossed its $1.5 billion target, and Marvell expects to “very significantly” surpass its $2.5 billion AI revenue target in fiscal 2026. Marvell’s management is confident that revenues from its custom XPU solutions will continue expanding in fiscal 2027 and beyond.As AI workloads grow, data centers need enhanced networking and interconnect products. MRVL is capitalizing on this shift with its high-speed optical interconnects, including 800G PAM, 400ZR DCI, and its industry-first 1.6T PAM DSP (digital signal processor), which cuts down on optical module power usage by 20%.Furthermore, the shift from copper to optical connectivity in AI infrastructure represents a massive growth opportunity for the company. MRVL’s Co-Packaged Optics technology and its development of the industry's first 2nm silicon IP for cloud and AI workloads solidify its position in the next-generation networking space.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Steady, MRVL’s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc. Price and ConsensusBroadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. QuoteHowever, the consensus mark for Marvell’s fiscal 2026 earnings has declined by a penny to $2.76 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 75.16% growth over fiscal 2025.Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMarvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. QuoteBoth AVGO’s and MRVL’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Marvell’s average surprise of 4.25% is better than AVGO’s surprise of 3.44%, reflecting a good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: MRVL is Cheaper Than AVGOBoth Marvell and Broadcom are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. However, in terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Marvell shares are trading at 6.54X, lower than AVGO’s 16.12X.MRVL and AVGO ValuationAVGO is a Better Buy Right NowBroadcom’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential. Marvell’s near-term prospects are dull, as customers are rescheduling orders to manage excess chip inventories. The U.S. government’s export restriction on certain Chinese customers is likely to continue to be an overhang on Marvell’s top line.Currently, Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared with Marvell, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Product Expansion Powers Garmin's Outdoor Category Sales Growth in Q1,1746104820000,"Garmin Ltd. GRMN delivered a strong start to fiscal 2025, fueled by an impressive performance in its Outdoor segment. While overall first-quarter results were mixed, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenues and earnings, the company still posted an 11% year-over-year increase in total sales, reaching a record $1.54 billion. Much of that growth came from the Outdoor business, which is quickly becoming Garmin’s most important and profitable unit.In the first quarter, Outdoor segment sales jumped 20% year over year to $438 million, leading all five operating segments in both growth and absolute revenues. Even more notable, the segment generated $129 million in operating income, up 20% from the prior year, with strong gross and operating margins of 64% and 29%, respectively. This performance highlights not only rising demand but also Garmin’s ability to deliver profitability through premium, purpose-built devices.Product Expansion Drives Garmin’s Outdoor SalesGarmin’s sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio has been driving the Outdoor category’s overall performance. The company aggressively expanded its adventure-focused product lineup during the first quarter, targeting niche outdoor sports and lifestyle categories where the brand already has a strong following.The standout release was the Instinct 3 series, a refreshed line of adventure watches now offering a bright AMOLED display. Garmin also introduced new devices in the dive (Descent G2), tactical (tactix 8) and golf (Approach S44/S50) categories, each designed to serve dedicated use cases.This strategy of deepening product offerings within specific activity verticals is clearly paying off. It allows Garmin to better serve enthusiasts who value specialized features and are willing to pay a premium for reliable performance in challenging conditions.The company also launched new handheld GPS products like the Montana series with SOS satellite functionality, as well as the solar-powered Approach G20 GPS for golfers, billed as the first of its kind with unlimited battery life in sunlight.Garmin Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Garmin Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Garmin Ltd. QuoteOutdoor: Garmin’s Most Profitable Growth EngineThe success of the Outdoor segment is especially valuable for Garmin right now as other parts of the business face more uneven conditions. For instance, Marine revenues declined 2% in the first quarter due to promotional timing, while Aviation grew a modest 3%.The Auto OEM segment gained 31% but remains the least profitable, with a $9 million operating loss in the quarter. Fitness, meanwhile, saw a healthy 12% increase thanks to demand for wearables, but its margins trailed those of Outdoor.Outdoor’s high-margin profile gives Garmin a financial cushion and enhances overall earnings quality. It also helps the company absorb macro pressures like U.S.-China tariff impacts, which are estimated to raise annual costs by roughly $100 million. Despite those headwinds, Garmin maintained its full-year EPS guidance at $7.80, a sign of confidence that strengths like Outdoor can support the bottom line.

3 Reasons US Equities May Be Short-Term Overheated,1747316940000,"2025 has been anything but uneventful. Stocks began correcting early in the year when China’s “DeepSeek” AI platform upended the bull thesis and brought “Mag 7” valuations back to Earth. Then, President Trump’s “Liberation Day” led to washout selling even where the major indices briefly went into “bear market territory.” Since then, trade deals have begun to trickle in, and most importantly, tensions between the US and China have thawed. Though bulls are in control of the primary trend, US equities may be due for a pullback for three reasons, including:Sentiment has Flipped to GreedLast month, I pointed out several times to Technology Innovator service subs that sentiment had neared rock bottom levels. For example, the CNN Fear & Greed Indicator, which combines seven different market indicators to derive what emotion drives the market, registered its most “Fearful” in several years. However, it can be breathtaking what simple price appreciation can do to sentiment. In just a few weeks, sentiment has flipped to near “Extreme Greed” levels.Image Source: CNNThe Nasdaq 100 is OverboughtBeaten-down big-tech stocks within the Nasdaq 100 like Microsoft ( MSFT ), Apple ( AAPL ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Broadcom ( AVGO ) have rebounded viciously off the tariff-panic lows. That said, in the short-term, the Relative Strength Index suggests that they may be overheated. Historically, when 24% or more of Nasdaq 100 stocks have an RSI reading above 70, returns one week later are negative.Image Source: @subutrade.786 Fibonacci & Previous Resistance The S&P 500 Index has been up more than 20% since the April 7th panic lows. To put that in context, the S&P 500 Index historically returns roughly 10% on average annually. While the bulls have regained control, markets never go straight up. The S&P 500 and other major indices are approaching their .786 Fibonacci retracement levels – an area where markets tend to pause.Image Source: TradingViewIn addition, the S&P is approaching old supply levels that may take time for bulls to chew through.Bottom LineRapidly shifting sentiment, extreme overbought conditions, and key resistance levels suggest that investors should proceed with a fair degree of caution in the short-term.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1ab6aa09a094b:0-3-reasons-us-equities-may-be-short-term-overheated/
"These 2 Chip Stocks Could Be Better Bets Than Nvidia, Analyst Says — Barrons.com",1746022500000,"By Adam ClarkWhile Nvidia is the unquestioned leader in artificial-intelligence chips, it could be time to buy shares of its rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom for the next phase of the AI trade, according to Seaport Research Partners.As Nvidia's customers start to seek greater return on investment on their AI spending, then the difficulties of deploying its most advanced systems could become a drawback, according to Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg.Goldberg initiated coverage of Nvidia with a Sell rating and a $100 target price in a research note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, he gave Broadcom a Buy rating and a $230 target price and AMD a Buy rating and $100 target price.Nvidia shares were down 3.6% in morning trading. Broadcom stock fell 2.7% and AMD dropped 3%, as technology stocks suffered amid a raft of weak economic data on Wednesday.""Nvidia is one of the leading beneficiaries of the current AI spending boom, but its prospects are well understood and largely priced into the stock,"" Goldberg wrote.For Broadcom, the positives are directly related to its growing role in AI chips, as it helps large companies, such as Alphabet's Google unit and Meta Platforms, design custom chips.""Any time Nvidia loses share today it is to hyperscalers' internal chip designs, and Broadcom is poised to make a lot of money helping them bring those chips to production,"" Goldberg wrote.Meta executives said recently that its in-house MTIA chips could replace graphics-processing units — the specialty of Nvidia — in some servers and be expanded to power AI training. So far, custom chips have generally been used mainly for inference, the process of generating answers or results from the models, rather than training.The upside for AMD is less directly related to the AI sector. The company is unlikely to gain significant market share from Nvidia in the short term, but it is gradually building up a portfolio to match its larger rival, Goldberg said. It can continue to benefit by taking market share from Intel in data centers more generally, he wrote.""AMD needs to be measured for its execution to roadmap and not its AI sales which we expect to be modest but growing over time,"" the analyst wrote.AMD is expected to launch the MI350 GPU series in the second half of the year. AMD has said the MI350 will deliver 35 times more performance for inference than older chips.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Broadcom Is Maintained at Buy by Citigroup,1744405500000,(21:05 GMT) Broadcom Price Target Cut to $210.00/Share From $220.00 by Citigroup,https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250411009324:0/
Broadcom Set to Surge as AI Diffusion Rule Ends,1747316880000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Over approximately the last three weeks, markets have been on the rise big-time. The  S&P 500 closed just under $5,900 on May 14, just around 4% lower than the all-time high it reached in February. As market sentiment shifts, Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , a leading semiconductor stock , has emerged as a top beneficiary. Despite at one point being down nearly 38% in 2025, Broadcom is now just slightly in the green this year as of the May 14 close.The announcement of the trade deal between the U.S. and China boosted the stock. Shares jumped almost 12% within two days after the announcement. However, there were other highly positive recent pieces of news for Broadcom that the trade deal may somewhat overshadow.Most notable is that President Trump is ending the Biden-era “AI Diffusion Rule."" Its end has the potential to substantially benefit companies like Broadcom . So, what exactly was the AI Diffusion Rule , and what does its cancellation mean for Broadcom?Understanding the End of AI Diffusion, NVIDIA and AMD See Immediate BenefitThe purpose of the AI Diffusion Rule was to give the U.S. government extensive control over which countries can and cannot get access to advanced AI chips made by American firms . Specifically, it controls chips used to train advanced AI models.The rule categorized countries into three different tiers. Tier 1 countries included many of America’s closest allies. These countries face no restrictions. Tier 2 countries include most other countries. India, Israel, Singapore, Switzerland, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were notable inclusions.These countries were limited in the number of chips they could buy. Tier 3 countries , which include adversaries like China and Russia, were not allowed to buy any advanced chips.Really, the government was trying to specifically prevent China and Russia from getting these chips to slow the advancement of their AI capabilities. With the ending of AI Diffusion , that isn’t likely to change. However, how the United States treats those Tier 2 countries is changing. NVIDIA's NASDAQ:NVDA announcement that it would sell 18,000 of its most advanced chips to Saudi Arabia on the same day the government eliminated the AI Diffusion rule provides evidence of this.Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD also announced a huge AI partnership in the country.Overall, the end of AI Diffusion means that chip companies with significant AI capabilities now have a much larger opportunity to sell their most advanced technology to these Tier 2 countries. Many of these countries are extremely wealthy, adding to the size of the opportunity . This extends to Broadcom, but in a slightly different way than NVIDIA and AMD.The End of AI Diffusion: Broadcom Waits Its Turn to CapitalizeBroadcom's custom chips are largely used for AI model inference, rather than primarily for AI model training. Training comes before inference. For countries like Saudi Arabia, this means they need time to train their models with NVIDIA and AMD chips . After that, Broadcom's chips can really make a difference. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO]Thus, the fact that NVIDIA and AMD are striking deals opens up the door for Broadcom to sell large amounts of chips to Tier 2 countries down the line. How long that might take is hard to say, but a big opportunity now exists for Broadcom nonetheless.The benefit to Broadcom comes even though the company hasn’t expressed concerns about AI Diffusion, at least with a specific set of customers. In the company’s last earnings call , Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon specifically asked about this.Rasgon asked whether AI diffusion would impact Broadcom’s design wins or shipments for the three big AI customers the firm is selling to in volume.In response, Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said, “To answer your question directly, no, we don't have any concerns."" This underscores Broadcom’s focus on inference chips , which AI Diffusion did not directly impact. However, they were indirectly impacted because training comes before inference. So, with AI Diffusion ending, the positive impact on Broadcom comes from the expansion of its serviceable market.The End of AI Diffusion Adds Another Broadcom TailwindFor the reasons discussed above, Broadcom can win big due to AI Diffusion ending . Its chips now have a strong path forward to getting into the hands of some of these huge Tier 2 countries. But, cashing in will likely take time.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:bbce48cea094b:0-broadcom-set-to-surge-as-ai-diffusion-rule-ends/

"Which AI Stock, NVIDIA or Broadcom, Is the Better Bargain to Buy? ",1744398000000,"Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made NVIDIA Corporation NVDA a Wall Street darling for some time. On the other hand, Broadcom Inc. ’s AVGO recent share repurchase plan, along with its planned moves to capitalize on the growing AI field, has delighted income-oriented investors. However, the latest trade war between the United States and several other countries has caused market turmoil, with shares of NVIDIA and Broadcom declining 19.9% and 25.7% year to date. This presents an opportunity to buy these quality stocks at a discounted price for long-term gains. But which stock is the better bargain? Let’s explore – Reasons to be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock NVIDIA leads the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market with over 80% share, giving the Jensen Huang-led company a competitive edge over its peers. More than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc .’s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in demand among developers. At the same time, there is an insane demand for NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips among notable tech firms due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces. The older Hopper chips also maintain steady demand due to their higher quality compared to rival Intel Corporation ’s INTC chips (read more: Can Intel Be the Turnaround Stock of 2025? Is the Time to Buy Now?).NVIDIA, meanwhile, is well-poised to make the most of the increase in AI data center spending. Top cloud computing stocks are fulfilling the increase in demand for AI workloads by acquiring GPUs and are spending $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure. One of NVIDIA’s prominent customers, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, may have reduced data center spending, but Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN are now supporting NVIDIA in this aspect. Reasons to be Bullish on Broadcom Stock Broadcom expects the demand for its custom AI accelerator to increase in the near future and the market size for its execution processing units (XPUs) to touch $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027, way higher than last year’s $12.2 billion. Broadcom’s XPUs can work on a particular workload and even outdo NVIDIA’s GPUs. Moreover, they have the competence to perform tasks more affordably than GPUs. Thus, banking on the rise in demand for accelerator chips, Broadcom is now developing a 2-nanometer AI XPU, which is unique. The company’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), known to support AI and machine learning, are witnessing strong demand as well. NVDA or AVGO: Which Stock is a Better Bargain Buy? No doubt, with GPUs and XPUs gaining popularity in the coming years, and AI infrastructure spending increasing, the future does look bright for both NVIDIA and Broadcom. However, from a long-term perspective, NVIDIA is a better choice than Broadcom. This is because NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently than Broadcom, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, more than AVGO’s 18.5%. NVIDIA has also been able to control its expenditures and generate profits in a much better way than Broadcom since its return on equity (ROE) of 117.6% outshined AVGO’s 38.5%. But from a short-term viewpoint, Broadcom has an upper hand over NVIDIA. After all, Broadcom is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a better-quality business that can keep the company immune to the current market vagaries. Broadcom has increased its dividends 6 times over the past five years, and its payout ratio sits at a healthy 52% of earnings. Broadcom also has sufficient cash balance to pay off its dividends. Check Broadcom’s dividend history here. On the contrary, NVIDIA’s payout ratio sits at a paltry 1% of earnings and the company increased dividends only once in the past five years.

TSMC Stock Gets Trump Boost. Intel Thinks It Knows How to Strike Back. — Barrons.com,1746015300000,"By Adam ClarkTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is basking in the approval of the Trump administration for its U.S. investment plans. Intel faces an uphill struggle to compete but has detailed its plan to regain leadership in chip manufacturing, involving a costly bet on new machinery.Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, has claimed the role of the world's leading manufacturer of advanced chips. Now it is planning to spend a total of $165 billion on U.S. factories as it looks to simultaneously defuse the threat of U.S. tariffs on imported semiconductors and Chinese efforts to claim the self-ruled island of Taiwan.The American investment plan has won it the backing of the White House, underlined on Tuesday when Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick visited TSMC's site in Arizona where the company was breaking ground on a third chip-fabrication facility.""We are at TSMC Arizona to celebrate the return of American manufacturing. President Trump's bold leadership and clear direction are driving companies and jobs back to this country at a record pace,"" Lutnick said in a statement.The public endorsement could allay fears TSMC will face levies on its Taiwan-made chips. President Donald Trump has publicly stated he told the company it could face a tax of up to 100% if it doesn't shift more production to the U.S.American depositary receipts of TSMC were rising 1.5% in premarket trading on Wednesday, with the ADRs down 17% so far this year through Tuesday's close.What's good news for TSMC is likely bad news for Intel, which would face an easier path to winning significant chip-manufacturing business if its Taiwanese rival's products faced tariffs.However, Intel is hoping to prove it has superior technology with the 18A process it is launching this year and the next-generation 14A process where low-volume production is planned for 2027. It said Tuesday that multiple customers have said they would build test chips on the new process and noted that research, development, and wafer production will all be U.S.-based.""Intel is committed to building a world-class foundry that serves the growing need for leading-edge process technology, advanced packaging and manufacturing,"" said CEO Lip-Bu Tan in a statement.One notable difference between Intel and TSMC's plans is that the American company has acquired two of the most advanced lithography tools for manufacturing semiconductors on the market from Dutch company ASML Holding. The high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet, or High NA EUV, machines cost more than 350 million euros each, equivalent to about $398 million.TSMC has publicly been reluctant to order ASML's High NA EUV systems, citing its high cost, and suggested it could continue to use older machines for advanced chip manufacturing.That means there could be a window for Intel to secure a technological lead. However, the company still needs to prove it can attract external customers, with Nvidia and Broadcom reported to be running tests on its 18A process.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wolfspeed Stock Rises for Third Day. Why Shares Are Suddenly Surging. — Barrons.com,1747234200000,"By Brian SwintWolfspeed, the semiconductor firm that is trying to restructure its debt, looked set to rise for a third consecutive day Wednesday after a report that negotiations among creditors are happening.Apollo Global Management, one of the biggest holders of Wolfspeed's $6.5 billion of debt, is in talks with investment bank Moelis about a restructuring, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The stock plunged 26% Friday after the company said that it faces the risk of not being able to continue as a ""going concern"" on its latest earnings call.Wolfspeed rose 0.5% to $3.89 in Wednesday morning trading after gaining 16% on Tuesday and 1.8% Monday. Coming into the session, it was down almost 6% over the past five days and 42% lower in 2025.Wolfspeed makes silicon-carbide technology for use in the automotive industry and would stand to benefit from renewed interest in chips and artificial intelligence. Its problem is that it was due for funding under President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act that now looks doubtful under President Donald Trump. It has been one of the most shorted stocks on the market this year--short selling is when traders bet that the price of shares will fall.Other chip stocks were mixed on Wednesday. Big names Nvidia, AMD, and Arm were all rising, while others such as Broadcom and Intel were lower. Smaller chip maker Alpha & Omega was falling while peer Indie Semiconductor was rising. The Nasdaq was up 0.4%.Wolfspeed didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Stock buybacks present solid trade-war tradeoff,1744372800000,"Buying the dip is a good idea for at least one set of investors: CFOs. Chipmaker Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO unveiled a $10 billion share buyback plan, in a move that helps buffer valuations suffering even after Wednesday’s tariffs-rollback rally. Unlike many stock repurchases that tend to occur when prices are rising, doing so now would be a shrewd use of corporate capital to buck market trends.Broadcom’s program sends a signal that boss Hock Tan has unwavering confidence in a strategy to dominate the customized artificial intelligence semiconductor market for customers such as Google and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META . He has done this before, in 2021 and 2023, while simultaneously financing the $61 billion VMware acquisition. The results speak for themselves: after falling 37% to start 2025, the company’s stock price has jumped 14% since Monday’s announcement. It is also up 550% over five years.The math is sometimes simple. When shares trade below their intrinsic value, buybacks deliver quick returns. Reducing the number outstanding lifts per-share metrics, offering sellers immediate cash for a bigger piece of future profits. When funding big projects or M&A carries more risk, as it does now amid erratic tariff policy, acquiring discounted shares is the better option. Even Warren Buffett endorses the idea, saying there’s no better investment than your own business at a bargain.Too many executives, however, are less judicious than the Oracle of Omaha with their buybacks. Photoshop developer Adobe NASDAQ:ADBE , for example, authorized a $25 billion plan last March after its acquisition of rival Figma collapsed. The shares, at $550 apiece then, now trade around $360. United Airlines NASDAQ:UAL , Lululemon Athletica NASDAQ:LULU and Coty NYSE:COTY are among the others with bad timing in recent years.S&P 500 Index SP:SPX members spent a record $940 billion on stock repurchases last year, shattering the $800 billion mark from 2023, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Activity is up slightly in 2025; first quarter earnings will offer more clarity. Some CEOs may be short on cash while others will be inclined to hoard it with chances of recession growing. For the ones ready to reassure shareholders and capitalize on valuation markdowns, there are plenty of opportunities to back themselves.Follow @sptruestories on XCONTEXT NEWSBroadcom on April 7 unveiled a plan to buy back as much as $10 billion of its own shares through the end of the year. The chipmaker’s stock price gained 14% following the announcement.","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L6N3QO0XT:0-stock-buybacks-present-solid-trade-war-tradeoff/"

AI-Driven Server and Storage Demand Likely to Boost SMCI's Q3 Earnings,1745927700000,"Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI is preparing to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results this week. Amid an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, the company is well-positioned for another quarter of strong revenue growth.Strong Server and Storage Demand to Fuel SMCI’s Sales GrowthThe Server and Storage Systems segment remains the cornerstone of Super Micro Computer’s financial strength. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.08 billion, marking a 37.4% rise compared to the year-ago quarter.The robust growth forecast is anticipated to have been driven largely by growing demand for graphics processing unit (GPU)-optimized servers tailored for AI workloads. SMCI has been capitalizing on strong customer interest in both air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled (DLC) rack-scale platforms, which are essential for the next wave of AI data center expansion.Super Micro Computer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Super Micro Computer, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Super Micro Computer, Inc. QuoteAnother key factor supporting the segment’s momentum is Super Micro Computer’s early availability of systems built on NVIDIA’s new Blackwell GPU architecture, alongside continued strength in Hopper-based systems. The expansion of the company’s Datacenter Building Block Solutions, which offers customers a one-stop integrated solution for servers, storage, networking and cooling, is expected to have further boosted adoption among enterprises and hyperscalers during the to-be-reported quarter.Leadership in DLC technology has also been a powerful competitive advantage for Super Micro Computer. As AI training models become more resource-intensive, data centers are increasingly adopting DLC solutions to meet energy efficiency and density requirements. This trend is likely to have boosted the Server and Storage Systems segment’s revenues in the third quarter.While margins are expected to have remained under pressure due to customer mix and ramping investments in next-generation platforms, the strong top-line growth in the Server and Storage Systems business is anticipated to have helped partially offset earnings headwinds.SMCI’s Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Super Micro Computer flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Chip Stocks Reverse Rally as Trade Fears Resurface,1744308058000,"Semiconductor shares fell sharply Thursday as markets reversed course following Wednesday's brief rally.

"Docusign Benefits From eSignature Demand, Low Liquidity Ails",1744291560000,"Docusign, Inc. DOCU stock has gained 32.1% in a year against the industry and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s decline of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively.Docusign reported impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. DOCU’s EPS (excluding 47 cents from non-recurring items) was 86 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4% and increased 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. Total revenues of $776.3 million beat the consensus mark by 2.1% and rose 9% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.How is Docusign Faring?Docusign’s top line significantly benefits from continued customer demand for eSignature in a large addressable market. DOCU’s customer base has grown from 1.3 million in fiscal 2023 to 1.5 million in fiscal 2024 and then to 1.7 million in fiscal 2025. This trend leads us to believe that the growth can be sustained in the future as well.Despite this rising demand, the market for eSignatures remains largely untapped. The global e-signature platform market size was $5.2 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $18.6 billion by 2029. In this expansive market, Adobe Acrobat Sign is the major competitor to DOCU’s eSignature, leaving a significant market share for the latter to address. Hence, the company is exposed to sufficient opportunities to expand eSignature across businesses globally, which will boost its top line.Over the past three years, subscription fees have contributed to 97% of DOCU’s top line on average. The company’s subscription plans generally range from one year to three years and the fees include the use of its products and access to customer support. A subscription model is very useful for software developers because it creates a recurring revenue stream and improves the visibility of cash flows.Furthermore, it also makes expensive software affordable and accessible to companies with limitations on resources, thus expanding the market. DOCU’s direct and indirect go-to-market initiatives also facilitated growth with commercial and enterprise customers. Multiple customer programs and initiatives and an expanded customers have gradually increased subscription revenue growth over time. The 7.8% growth in subscription revenues in fiscal 2025 is a testament to the company’s successful endeavour at winning and retaining customers.Docusign has strengthened its relationships with tech giants such as Salesforce and Microsoft. The company has expanded its global strategic partnership with Salesforce. Docusign and Salesforce partnered to develop solutions for the automation of the contract creation process and the expansion of collaboration among organizations that use the latter’s Slack. With Microsoft Teams, DOCU has made an eSignature integration and become the official electronic signature provider in the former’s Approvals app. Partnerships enable Docusign to tap into more accounts than it could individually.However, Docusign’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 0.81 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, down from the industry’s 2.54 and the year-ago quarter's 0.94. A declining current ratio due to a decrease in cash does not sit well for the company’s liquidity position. Furthermore, a current ratio of less than 1 indicates that the company does not have the resources to cover its short-term obligations.Docusign has never declared and currently does not intend to pay out cash dividends. So, the only way to achieve a return on investment on the stock is price appreciation, which is not guaranteed. Hence, investors seeking cash dividends should avoid buying DocuSign’s shares.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDOCU has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector are Broadcom Inc. AVGO and CommScope COMM.Broadcom sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Quality Growth Stocks Make Sense for an Uncertain Economy — Barrons.com,1747164480000,"By Jacob SonenshineThis time is a little different.When the market rallies, investors usually want to own the riskiest stocks. But right now, the winning formula has changed: The best names to buy are good-quality companies that also have high potential for growth.The S&P 500 is up 17% from the low point it hit in its nasty decline in April. Areas that lost the most when expectations about the economy soured have led the way, rebounding faster as the picture has brightened. The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce sky-high tariffs that were choking off trade between the countries, and the White House has indicated that deals with other countries are on the way.That would mean reduced tariffs, less inflation, and more spending by consumers and businesses.At this point, investors looking for stocks to buy at today's prices should avoid economically sensitive, riskier industries such as retail, restaurants, or financials. They are now a hair above their levels just before President Donald Trump unveiled surprisingly high tariffs against a wide range of countries in early April, meaning they are no longer reflecting much potential economic weakness.Yet harder times are still a possibility. While Trump has partially rolled back tariffs, a 10% baseline tariff rate remains in place. Interest rates, all the while, have remained around 4%, where they have now hovered across various maturities for a few years . High rates take time to push consumer spending down, so that is a continuing source of pressure on consumers.Economic growth is more likely to slow down than to significantly accelerate.Given all that, strategists at UBS screened for higher-quality companies that can increase their earnings regardless, reasoning those stocks are likely to perform best as the economy adjusts to President Donald Trump's trade war.The bank looked for companies with four qualities. They had to have a market capitalization of at least $10 billion, higher expected earnings growth than most publicly traded companies, and trade at forward price/earnings multiples closer to their historical averages than most stocks. Finally, companies had to be of higher ""operational quality"" than most businesses.The latter means they have characteristics that enable them to consistently increase earnings. Those include pricing power — the ability to lift prices without damaging demand — and high profit margins, which insulate a company from losing money during recessions.Stocks that make the cut can be expected to offer growth at a reasonable price, or GARP. UBS's screen yielded six names: Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company; Broadcom; Intuit, which owns TurboTax and QuickBooks; Cintas, which supplies uniforms and cleaning supplies to businesses; Heico, the dominant maker of aircraft parts; and Salesforce, the provider of cloud-based sales software.Analysts expect sales at Salesforce to rise by just over 9% annually to $49.1 billion by 2027, according to FactSet. If the economy stumbles, some customers may scale back their investments in new cloud-based technologies as they watch their budgets, but any cuts are likely to be mild. Companies need the newest, fastest, and most cost efficient technologies to make the most of sales opportunities.That is where Salesforce comes in. Its artificial intelligence agents give customers a reason to pay higher subscription prices for its software products, so its revenue growth is higher than for the average S&P 500 company.If the company remains disciplined with costs, that would help profit margins increase, sending earnings per share up about 13% annually over the coming three years, according to FactSet. That compares with the 11% in growth in the aggregate earnings expected for companies in the S&P 500.That kind of profit growth would likely push the stock higher because its price/earnings ratio isn't likely to drop much from its current level. Salesforce trades at about 25 times the earnings per share expected for the coming 12 months, about 14 points below its five-year average of about 39 times. The S&P 500 sells for 21 times, compared with the five-year average of 20 times.Buy GARP stocks. They are just a better deal than the ones that are, well, the riskiest.Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Is Lam Research Stock a Buy Post Upbeat Q3 Earnings Performance?,1745866800000,"Lam Research Corporation LRCX recently posted strong third-quarter fiscal 2025 results, helping its shares rise 7% since the April 23 release. Lam Research, a leader in semiconductor fabrication equipment, reported solid financials, surpassing market expectations and reaffirming its position in the industry amid ongoing fluctuations in the semiconductor cycle.The stock has declined 1.1% year to date (YTD) in a highly volatile 2025 market scenario, with positive momentum post earnings showing signs of stability and an attractive valuation relative to its industry peers. Nonetheless, LRCX has outperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as key semiconductor peers such as Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL in the YTD period.YTD Price Return PerformanceFor investors considering their next move, here’s why buying Lam Research stock might be the most prudent approach now.Q3 Results Show Lam Research’s Financial ResilienceLam Research’s third-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, showcasing the company’s solid financial foundation. Total revenues reached $4.72 billion, a 24.5% increase year over year, underpinned by continued demand across the memory and logic segments. Despite a challenging backdrop for the semiconductor industry, Lam Research managed a non-GAAP EPS of $1.04, exceeding analyst forecasts and improving 33.5% from the year-ago quarter (adjusted for the stock split).Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Lam Research Corporation QuoteThis strong financial performance reinforces Lam Research’s resilience in navigating an evolving semiconductor cycle. As demand grows for advanced nodes, LRCX’s specialized technology in etch and deposition tools for high-aspect-ratio structures positions it well to capitalize on this trend. The company’s third-quarter results also highlight its effective cost management, which has enabled sustained profitability even amid fluctuating end-market demand.Datacenter and AI Chip Demand to Fuel Growth for LRCXLam Research is benefiting from the booming demand for AI and datacenter chips, which require advanced fabrication technologies. The company’s deposition and etch solutions are critical for producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging technologies, which are essential for AI workloads.In 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion by 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents further growth opportunities for Lam’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.With AI-driven investments accelerating, Lam’s leading position in etch and deposition makes it a key beneficiary of the next semiconductor spending cycle.Strategic Investments Aid Lam Research’s ProspectsLam Research’s continued investment in research & development and product innovation is paying off. The company’s Cryo 3.0 technology is setting new performance benchmarks for high-aspect-ratio dielectric etch applications, giving Lam a technological edge in next-gen semiconductor manufacturing.Additionally, Lam Research’s Aether dry-resist solution has been selected by multiple customers, including a leading memory manufacturer for high-bandwidth DRAM production. This underscores Lam Research’s growing influence in the memory fabrication market, particularly as HBM demand soars due to AI and HPC growth.Moreover, Lam has expanded its manufacturing footprint in Asia, improving cost efficiencies and responsiveness to customer demand. These strategic moves allowed Lam to achieve a 160-basis point expansion in operating margins in 2024 despite broader industry challenges. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the non-GAAP operating margin improved 210 basis points year over year to 32.8%.NAND Recovery to Drive Lam Research’s GrowthLam Research is also positioned to benefit from the rebounding NAND flash market. After a prolonged downturn, NAND spending is showing early signs of recovery.Although industry-wide NAND investments are still focused on technology upgrades rather than capacity expansion, Lam Research’s molybdenum (Moly) and carbon gap fill solutions are gaining traction. Management expects these technologies to drive hundreds of millions of dollars in NAND-related revenues in 2025.The ongoing transition to higher-layer count technology (above 200-layer counts) by NAND manufacturers bodes well for Lam Research’s revenue trajectory in the coming years.Valuation: Lam Research is UndervaluedLam Research’s valuation remains reasonable. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.1, which is significantly lower than the sector’s 23.43. The company’s discounted valuation multiple aligns with its long-term growth potential.The stock’s P/E ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including Broadcom, NVIDIA and Marvell Technology. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Marvell Technology have forward 12-month P/E multiples of 26.68X, 24.71X and 20.03X, respectively.Conclusion: Buy LRCX Right NowLam Research’s discounted valuation, solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling investment option right now.

Broadcom's Big Outperformance Shows Strength Amid Tariff Decline,1744290540000,"Amid all of the tariff-related volatility in the market,  semiconductor leader Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO has fared better than many. Since Trump’s tariff announcement hit markets on Apr. 3, shares of Broadcom are up nearly 8% as of the Apr. 9 close.This performance is impressive, considering the S&P 500 Index is down nearly 3% over that period. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ:SOXQ is down 2%. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] However, Broadcom dropped over 10% on Apr. 3 in reaction to the Liberation Day announcement.It dropped another 5% the next day as the Chinese announced reciprocal tariffs. Thus, markets clearly feel Broadcom has some tariff risk.This comes even though Trump excluded semiconductors from his tariffs. The analysis below will break down Broadcom’s tariff exposure in two ways: direct and indirect exposure.It will also examine why the stock has performed comparatively well.Direct Tariff Implications: Semiconductor Exemption Provides RespiteOverall, because semiconductors are exempt from the tariffs, Broadcom’s direct exposure is somewhat minimal. However, tariffs on semiconductors could be coming. President Trump recently said that tariffs on chips will come “very soon”. This would create a significant effect on Broadcom’s business. In 2024, 20% of the firm’s total revenues came from China. Tariffs on these goods would hamper demand in the country.However, at the moment, the direct impact of tariffs on Broadcom isn’t the main concern, especially with Trump softening his stance. He announced that countries that don’t enact retaliatory tariffs will be exempt from the latest U.S. tariffs. This sent the market—and Broadcom shares—soaring. It signals that Trump isn’t drawing a hard line in the sand and could ease his aggressive tariff policies. It also suggests he may walk back the idea of implementing chip tariffs.Notably, tariffs haven’t been a big topic of conversation at Broadcom’s meetings with analysts. Since Aug. 2024, participants in the firm’s five earnings or conference calls have used the word “tariffs” a total of just three times.Indirect Tariff Implications: Broadcom’s Bigger ProblemThe indirect impact of tariffs is likely to be much more impactful on Broadcom. Imported products that contain Broadcom’s chips are subject to tariffs. The vast majority of chip manufacturing takes place in Asia, meaning that final products shipped to the U.S. will face higher costs. [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] These higher costs will degrade demand for these products and thus the Broadcom chips inside them. This could affect both Broadcom’s AI chip and non-AI chip businesses. Both made up just under 28% of revenue last quarter.Within non-AI chips, Broadcom has large exposure to Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , which uses its chips in its consumer devices. With tariffs expected to impact Apple sales and profits, Broadcom will likely also take a hit.Broadcom’s AI servers could also be significantly impacted by Asian manufacturing. Reports indicate that, in general, 60% of AI servers are made in Mexico,  and 30% come from Taiwan. Stacy Ragson of Bernstein Research does not expect the tariffs to affect those servers made in Mexico.If Broadcom’s AI server manufacturing is similar to these figures, it could avoid a significant amount of tariffs on its AI business. It is important to note that the locations of companies making these servers for Broadcom are unknown. Actual figures could be significantly different.Why Broadcom Has Performed Relatively Well in Bad Market ConditionsOne likely reason that Broadcom shares have held up relatively well is that its AI customers are hyperscalers. These companies are cash-rich and view AI as massively important to their long-term goals. This means a big chunk of Broadcom’s sales has a chance to remain largely intact as these firms prioritize spending on AI.Additionally, infrastructure software made up 45% of the firm’s revenue last quarter. This isn’t affected by current tariffs. However, companies could cut back on spending here to make up for higher costs in other areas.Another factor that has been a boon to Broadcom shares is a big announcement it recently made. Broadcom announced a $10 billion share buyback program after the market close on Apr. 7, a sign of Broadcom’s continued confidence in its business and ability to generate cash despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment ahead.Overall, there is reason to believe that Broadcom has moderate insulation from tariffs. However, if tariffs lead to a recession, this would certainly be bad for business. It will be very interesting to see what management has to say about tariffs going forward.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:09cd3a461094b:0-broadcom-s-big-outperformance-shows-strength-amid-tariff-decline/

NYSE:NET , the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application.AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale.Palo Alto Networks® NASDAQ:PANW , the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations.Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete.

Nvidia Stock Falls. This Huawei Breakthrough Won't Help. — Barrons.com,1745850540000,"By Adam ClarkNvidia stock was dropping Monday as the company prepares for a new challenge in the artificial-intelligence chip sector from China's Huawei Technologies.Nvidia shares were down 2% at $108.84 in morning trading, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2%. The stock rose 4.3% in Friday's session.Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing a new chip, called the Ascend 910D, which it hopes will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia's H100 was released in 2022 and has since been superseded by later generations of its Hopper chips and its new Blackwell AI semiconductors.Nvidia is prohibited from selling its most powerful AI chips to Chinese companies. Huawei is already poised to ship more than 800,000 of its Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers including state-owned telecommunications carriers and private AI developers, such as TikTok's parent ByteDance, according to the Journal.Nvidia's market in China was already set to shrink after the Trump administration said it would impose license requirements on future sales of its H20 AI accelerators, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. sanctions on Chinese AI exports. In fiscal 2025, 13% of Nvidia's sales were from billing addresses in China, down from 26% in fiscal 2022.Outside of China, the challenge from Huawei could be limited as it continues to lag behind Nvidia's latest technology.""The only real threat that I see to Nvidia here is in China where the state's control over the private sector may ensure a switch away from Nvidia's CUDA [software] with developers learning how to use Huawei's development platforms instead,"" wrote Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who publishes Radio Free Mobile.One potential piece of good news for Nvidia is that one of its largest U.S. customers, Elon Musk's xAI, is seeking to raise $20 billion in funding, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter. The AI start-up didn't immediately respond to a request for comment early Monday.Plenty of that money could be spent on Nvidia's hardware if the reported funding takes place, as xAI has invested in hundreds of thousands of the company's chips to run its AI data centers.Nvidia also said Monday that the first of software-and-cloud computing company Oracle's liquid-cooled GB200 NVL72 racks, which stitch together dozens of Nvidia's chips, were ready for use by customers.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was up 0.1% and Broadcom was down 1.2% in morning trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Over the past 60 days, earnings estimates for QCOM for fiscal 2025 have improved from $11.64 per share to $11.85 and for fiscal 2026 from $12.43 per share to $12.61.QCOM Estimate TrendEarnings Surprise HistoryThe chip manufacturer delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%, on average, beating estimates on each occasion. In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off an earnings surprise of 16.4%. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Qualcomm for the fiscal second quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is perfectly the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Qualcomm currently has an ESP of +0.86% with a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Factors Shaping the Upcoming ResultsWith the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, Qualcomm is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. The company is well-positioned to meet its long-term revenue targets, driven by solid 5G traction, greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. The company intends to harness artificial intelligence (AI) to meet increased demands for essential products and services that are the building blocks of digital transformation in a cloud economy. Qualcomm envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio.During the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon X chip for mid-range AI (artificial intelligence) desktops and laptops. This SoC (system-on-chip) is the fourth such product in the Snapdragon X processor line, following the successful launch of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core, Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite series. Based on a 4-nanometer process, the Snapdragon X chip comprises an 8-core Oryon central processor, a graphics component and a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU accelerates AI workloads, offering 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), making it an ideal platform to power Copilot+PCs – Microsoft Corporation ’s MSFT vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware. In the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm announced that Samsung, one of the major smartphone manufacturers in the world, deployed the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for its S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra devices. The advanced chip features the Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 Mobile Connectivity system and the Snapdragon X80 5G Modem-RF System, which ensure blazing fast 5G and WiFi 7 speeds. Qualcomm also extended its Snapdragon G Series portfolio with the addition of next-generation gaming chipsets. The 2025 product lineup includes Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 chips. These initiatives are likely to be reflected in the upcoming results.Price PerformanceOver the past year, Qualcomm has lost 12.2% against the industry’s growth of 9.1%, lagging peers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HPE and Broadcom Inc. AVGO. While Broadcom has gained 43.6%, Hewlett Packard declined 5.5% over this period.Key Valuation MetricFrom a valuation standpoint, Qualcomm appears to be relatively cheaper compared to the industry and below its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 12.09 forward earnings, lower than 24.06 for the industry and the stock’s mean of 17.35. Investment ConsiderationsQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. The company is focusing on retaining its leadership in 5G, the chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological achievements and innovative product launches. It is likely to help users experience a seamless transition to superfast 5G networks, delivering low-power, resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with unprecedented range and Qualcomm's best-in-class security. This, in turn, offers the flexibility and scalability needed for broad and fast 5G adoption through accelerated commercialization by OEMs. The company is reportedly the only chipset vendor with 5G system-level solutions spanning both sub-6 and millimeter wave bands and one of the largest RF (radio frequency) front-end suppliers with design wins across all premium-tier smartphone customers. Leveraging the technology roadmap for a focused approach to innovation, it aims to connect millions of devices to the ‘connected intelligent edge.’ In addition, solid growth opportunities within the mobile space led by innovations in the Snapdragon portfolio for premium-tier Android handsets and a firmer footing in the emerging market of driver-assistance technology with the Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems portfolio are tailwinds.End NoteWith solid fundamentals and healthy revenue-generating potential driven by robust demand trends, Qualcomm appears to be a solid investment proposition. It also looks cheaper relative to the industry. Further, a strong emphasis on quality, diligent execution of operational plans and continuous portfolio enhancements are driving more value for customers. With improving earnings estimates, the stock is witnessing a positive investor perception.Riding on a robust earnings surprise history and favorable Zacks Rank, it appears primed to record solid quarterly earnings. Hence, investors are likely to profit if they bet on this high-flying stock now.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:661c393a9094b:0-pre-q2-earnings-is-qcom-stock-a-portfolio-must-have/
Time to Buy Broadcom (AVGO) Stock as Markets Rip Higher,1744240200000,"Added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on Wednesday, Broadcom's AVGO stock is standing out as markets ripped higher on news that President Trump will temporarily rescind reciprocal tariffs on many countries outside of China.Broadcom shares soared +18% in today’s trading session, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted gains of +9% and +12% respectively. The leading chipmaker is benefitting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, suggesting now may be an ideal time to buy the dip in AVGO which is still down 20% year to date amid broader market volatility.Broadcom’s ASIC Dominance Continues As the second largest AI chip supplier behind Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom’s expansion is being fueled by its specialization in application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) which are designed to perform specific tasks rather than general-purpose computing. To that point, Broadcom is thought to control up to 60% of the market share for ASIC chips.Furthermore, Broadcom’s concentration on AI processors is leading to significant revenue streams as hyper-scale clients such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet GOOGL build out their data centers for AI-specific applications and technology. What should lead to more optimism and higher investor sentiment is that Broadcom is also collaborating with Apple AAPL as the iPhone maker is developing its first server processor for AI applications.Tracking Broadcom’s Outlook Based on Zacks estimates, Broadcom’s total sales are expected to increase by 21% in fiscal 2025 to $62.39 billion compared to $51.57 billion last year. More intriguing, FY26 sales are projected to spike another 16% to $72.3 billion.On the bottom line, annual earnings are currently slated to soar 35% this year to $6.60 per share from EPS of $4.87 in 2024. Plus, FY26 EPS is forecasted to increase another 19% to $7.84.Suggesting the rally in AVGO could have legs is that FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are nicely up in the last month and have now risen 4% and 5% over the last 60 days respectively.AVGO Historical Performance & Valuation Despite the YTD drop in AVGO, Broadcom stock is sitting on +200% gains over the last three years and has skyrocketed over +1,300% in the last decade to impressively outperform the broader indexes and its Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors Market’s +311%.Making this year’s pullback more appealing is that AVGO is now trading at 23.6X forward earnings, which is near its industry average and the benchmark S&P 500’s 18.8X. It’s also noteworthy that AVGO is trading at a significant discount to its decade-long high of 47.9X forward earnings and closer to the median of 17.1X during this period.Bottom Line With positive earnings estimate revisions suggesting the rally in Broadcom’s stock could continue, it may be advantageous to get in on the company’s stellar growth as the ASIC chip market is thought to be valued at upward of $20 billion and is rapidly expanding. Notably, the Average Zacks Price Target of $249.25 a share still suggests 34% upside for AVGO following today’s rally.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:e687d8652094b:0-time-to-buy-broadcom-avgo-stock-as-markets-rip-higher/
"Nvidia, AMD help the chip sector to its highest close since February",1747085520000,"By Britney NguyenOne analyst says it's now time to go 'back to fundamentals' on Nvidia's stockMomentum from the U.S.-China trade agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Monday fueled the semiconductor sector to its highest close since February.The PHLX Semiconductor Index, which tracks 30 large semiconductor companies trading in the U.S., was up 7% at the end of the trading day on Monday, amid a broader stock-market rally spurred by the U.S.-China trade deal. The $4,780.93 close was its highest since Feb. 26, when it closed at $4,990.82, but is about 19% lower than its all-time closing high of $5,904.54 in July 2024, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Market Data.On Monday, U.S. and Chinese officials said they agreed to cut back tariffs on each other for a 90-day period. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on the U.S. from 125% to 10%.""This is clearly just the start of ... broader and more comprehensive negotiations, and we would expect both these tariff numbers to move down markedly over the coming months as deal talks progress,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note on Monday. They added that they ""believe new highs for the market and tech stocks are now on the table"" for the rest of the year, as investors will be following trade discussions in the coming months. Meanwhile, from their perspective, the ""massive tariff reductions at this time likely take a recession off the table for now.""Shares of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) gained 5.4% on Monday, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s (AMD) stock rose 5.1%. Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) stock climbed 6.4% higher, while Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) advanced 4.8%. The index's biggest gainer was Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC), up 12.8%. Intel Corp.'s (INTC) stock saw the smallest gain of the bunch, up 3.5%.Meanwhile, Nvidia and its fellow ""Magnificent Seven"" group of tech stocks gained more than $830 billion in market capitalization off of the agreement on Monday. Nvidia itself contributed $155 billion to that.Analysts at Melius Research stayed upbeat on Nvidia's stock on Monday, noting that more clarity on tariffs and trade relations with China makes the company ""much more investable."" However, an upcoming decision by President Donald Trump on imports of semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act has the tech supply chain ""scrambling to meet near-term demand for certain items that seem to be surging temporarily,"" such as personal computers and smartphone components.In a separate note containing charts, the Melius analysts argued that it's time to get ""back to fundamentals"" on Nvidia. ""Everything needs an accelerator,"" they wrote.

AMD vs. Broadcom: Which Semiconductor Stock Has Greater Upside?,1744225200000,"Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Broadcom AVGO are key providers of semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence (AI). Chips from these companies support running of Large Language Models that form the backbone of Generative AI (Gen AI). Growing AI deployment bodes well for both AMD and AVGO. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) expects double-digit growth rate in 2025 with semiconductor sales surging 19.1% to $627.6 billion in 2024. However, both AMD and Broadcom shares have suffered from tech sell-off year to date (YTD) amid rising fears of a recession following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on top trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada, which has increased the chances of a trade war. Semiconductor companies, including Broadcom and AMD, import key parts to international markets, which makes them vulnerable to a trade war.While AMD shares have lost 35.3% YTD, AVGO dropped 32.1%.AMD and AVGO Stock PerformanceSo, AMD or Broadcom, which is a better buy amid the challenging macroeconomic backdrop? Let’s find out.AMD’s Strong Portfolio, Rich Partner Base Key CatalystAMD is gaining traction in the cloud-data center and AI chip markets with its portfolio of fifth-gen EPYC Turin, fourth-gen and third-gen EPYC processors as well as Instinct accelerators and ROCm software suite. AMD delivered more than $5 billion in data center AI revenues in 2024, driven by deployments of MI300X by Meta Platforms and Microsoft. EPYC instances increased 27% in 2024 to more than 1000, with hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent launching more than 100 general-purpose AI instances in the fourth quarter of 2024 alone. AMD Instinct accelerators saw strong demand from a dozen cloud service providers, including IBM and Digital Ocean, and the company expects this number to grow in 2025. AMD’s MI325X is currently under production. Its next-generation MI350 series, based on CDNA 4 architecture, promises a 35 times increase in AI compute performance compared with CDNA 3. The company plans to ship samples to lead customers in the current quarter and is on track to accelerate production shipments to mid-year. The development of the MI400 series is also progressing well, and it remains on track to launch in 2026.AMD has been on an acquisitive spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem with buyouts like ZT Systems, Helsinki-based Silo AI, Nod.ai and Mipsology.Broadcom Rides on Strong Demand for XPUsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASICs, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost.AVGO’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of its kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment at hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, AMD’s SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVGO’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 4 cents over the past 30 days, indicating a 35.52% increase over fiscal 2024’s reported figure.Broadcom Inc.

Broadcom's VMware Deal Lifts AVGO Despite Complaints,1745838240000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom’s NASDAQ:AVGO acquisition of VMware has been a massive success . Broadcom has made many significant changes to extract value and improve VMware from a financial standpoint. So far, the changes have brought huge benefits to Broadcom.The semiconductor company reported revenue growth in its software segment of 47% last quarter, primarily due to VMware. Broadcom has also massively increased the profitability of VMware. In Aug. 2023, just before the acquisition, VMware had an adjusted operating margin of just under 29%. At the end of 2024, Broadcom’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Hock Tan said this figure hit 70% .Clearly, VMware has recently been a massive win for Broadcom. However, the changes Broadcom has implemented have left many customers incensed. The firm may be playing with fire long-term.The analysis below will detail Broadcom's changes to VMware to drive its success. It will also highlight the risks that Broadcom is taking on. Overall, Broadcom’s VMware strategy can continue adding significant value for the foreseeable future.Customers are Fighting Mad with Broadcom’s VMware ChangesBroadcom has made changes to VMware that are vast. It has cut the number of VMware employees approximately in half. It has also lowered the number of different packages offered from 8,000 to just four. However, the most impactful move has likely been the effort to switch customers to a subscription license rather than a perpetual one.This has caused many customers to see the price of their VMware service skyrocket. Price increases of 150% to 300% are on the lower end of the spectrum.Understandably, many are very unhappy with these changes. The fact that AT&T NYSE:T sued Broadcom in 2024 highlights this. It alleged that Broadcom didn’t honor the contract AT&T had with VMware prior to the acquisition. AT&T also said Broadcom quoted it a price increase of 1,050%.The companies have settled the lawsuit, but it epitomizes the sentiment of many customers regarding the VMware changes. Overall, this has resulted in many customers considering leaving VMware. One report suggests that nearly 52% of customers are mulling a breakup.The VMware changes have added great value to Broadcom. However, investors cannot ignore the real risk of losing many customers. However, considering leaving and actually doing so are two very different things. Evidence suggests that Broadcom might not be overplaying its hand, although customers are unhappy.VMware’s Stickiness Means Leaving Could Cause More Pain Than Benefit [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] Broadcom’s ability to push these huge price increases comes from VMware’s dominance and the huge drawbacks of switching to another provider. Scott Bickley of Info-Tech Research Group suggests that at least 80% of enterprises use some form of VMware.This ubiquitous adoption creates a large ecosystem of skilled talent and partners that know VMware well. This reinforces its usage and makes it difficult to switch to alternatives. Bickley explains that VMware creates a “super-glue-style lock-in.” To switch from VMware, companies need to rework their whole tech environment. He also notes that VMware alternatives lack the same level of functionality.A study from Gartner looked at how long it would take to perform a VMware migration. It estimated a period of 18 to 48 months for a large enterprise to do so. Not only would this take a massive amount of time, but there could also be disruptions in operations while making the change.Overall, Gartner estimates that a migration from VMware could cost a large enterprise more than $6 million. This doesn’t sound like a massive sum to a large company. However, this figure doesn’t include the fact that a company must continue paying Broadcom while it does its migration.It could take a significant amount of time before overall costs start to come down. A.J. Thompson of the IT consultancy firm Northdoor says that he has seen few companies that are willing to take on the pain of migrating from VMware.Broadcom’s VMware Strategy Can Continue to Add ValueOverall, although customers are not pleased with Broadcom, it seems that the company understands its power. At this point, Broadcom’s VMware strategy seems likely to continue benefiting the stock for years to come. This is further bolstered by the sheer amount of time it would take for customers to leave VMware.If Broadcom noticed a sea of customers attempting to leave, it could likely adjust its strategy in time to stave this off.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:86041dd87094b:0-broadcom-s-vmware-deal-lifts-avgo-despite-complaints/
"Chips, AI Stocks Jump on Tariff Pause",1744222680000,"By Katherine HamiltonSome of the biggest technology stocks spiked after President Trump said there would be a 90-day pause on tariffs, relieving fears about semiconductor chips and artificial intelligence.Apple and Nvidia gained 12% and 13%, respectively, to $192.43 and $109.15. Microsoft rose 8% to $383.82. Hewlett Packard climbed 7.9% to $23.61 and Intel jumped 16% to $21.06. Broadcom and Qualcomm were up 14% and 12%, respectively.Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Wednesday that there would be a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except for China, on which he is imposing a 125% tariff.Trump's tariff campaign wasn't set to directly affect semiconductors imported into the U.S., but China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports of products with chips in them could lead to higher prices on those electronics and weaken demand for them.Chip companies had fallen after President Trump said last week he was imposing tariffs of 32% on Taiwan and 34% on China.There were also concerns tariffs would slow down AI growth, given higher anticipated costs for many of the products used in data centers.Write to Katherine Hamilton at katherine.hamilton@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250409008543:0-chips-ai-stocks-jump-on-tariff-pause/

"Corporate America boosts security spending after UnitedHealth murder, filings show",1745830800000,"U.S. corporations have been ramping up their security spending, but following the murder of UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson that expenditure is set to rise further in 2025 as more companies see heightened threats to their top brass.At least a dozen S&P 500 companies have flagged an increase in security risks, a Reuters analysis of the proxy statements - or annual disclosures to shareholders - showed.Blue-chip companies such as Walmart NYSE:WMT , General Motors NYSE:GM , American Express NYSE:AXP and chipmaker Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO have disclosed new or increased security expenses from previous years.""The number of customers requiring assessments and executive protection has increased 10 to 15 times the number prior to December 4,"" said Glen Kucera, president at security services firm Allied Universal, which serves more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies.UnitedHealth NYSE:UNH spent $1.7 million on security for its top executives in 2024, the first time it disclosed the detail in its proxy statement on April 21. Its insurance unit CEO, Thompson, was shot dead on December 4 in a targeted attack in New York that raised fears among executives over threats to their safety. UnitedHealth rival Elevance Health NYSE:ELV cited an ""enhanced security risk environment"" to raise security benefits, while Johnson & Johnson NYSE:JNJ , Eli Lilly NYSE:LLY , and pharmacy chain Walgreens NASDAQ:WBA reported additional expenses. Of the 208 S&P 500 companies that have filed their annual proxy statement for fiscal 2024, about 31.3% of them granted a security perk to at least one of their named executive officers, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm.That expense rose to a median of $94,276, up from $69,180 in 2023, based on disclosures from roughly a quarter of the companies. In 2022, when 23.1% of companies reported security spending, the median was $40,917, Equilar told Reuters.Because Thompson's murder took place late in the year, compensation experts said proxy statements for 2025 will likely show an even greater increase in security spending.""We anticipate that security-related costs and perquisites will likely increase in terms of the amount of imputed income that's disclosed in proxies but also the prevalence,"" said David Kokell, head of U.S. compensation research at Institutional Shareholder Services. TOP EXECUTIVE THREATCEOs and other prominent executives can become lightning rods for anger directed toward broader organizations, leading to more spending on security, even though it is still a small fraction of a company's annual business expenses.General Motors said increased security would be offered to CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss after a recent assessment. Broadcom spent $1.37 million on CEO Hock Tan's security in 2024 but did not give the number for prior years, while credit card giant American Express' spending on security perks more than doubled from 2023 and is expected to increase in 2025. Other companies that boosted protection include utility companies Edison International NYSE:EIX and CenterPoint Energy NYSE:CNP , as well as Warner Bros Discovery NASDAQ:WBD .A vast majority of companies do not outline their security costs. Only 18% of S&P 500 and 5% of Russell 3000 companies disclosed personal and home security as a CEO compensation perquisite, according to 2024 data from The Conference Board. A full picture of the increase in spending will only emerge by September when more companies file their reports or next year, analysts said.Companies are also expanding the security cover to more executives and public events, experts said in the aftermath of Thompson's murder, which took place outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealth was holding an investor conference. The scope ""has actually expanded"", John Gainer, vice president at security firm TorchStone Global, said. ""It starts with the CEO, then the C-suite, and now increasingly includes the board—especially when it comes to public-facing events like board or shareholder meetings.""","https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_L4N3QS0E9:0-corporate-america-boosts-security-spending-after-unitedhealth-murder-filings-show/"

Nvidia Stock Rises. What Alphabet and Intel Earnings Mean for the Chip Maker. — Barrons.com,1745592180000,"By Adam Clark and Tae KimNvidia was climbing early Friday as the market digested earnings reports from Alphabet and rival chip maker Intel.Strong demand for artificial intelligence technology looks to bode well for the leading AI semiconductor company.Nvidia shares were up 1.2% at $107.70 in early trading Friday. The stock rose 3.6% on Thursday.Alphabet earnings on Thursday were being closely watched for any signs of a slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure. Nvidia investors should be reassured by the company holding its outlook for capital expenditure this year at $75 billion.Alphabet executives said they finished the quarter with more demand for cloud-computing services than the company had capacity to serve. They reiterated that Alphabet has a ""strong relationship"" with Nvidia, even as it continues to improve its own in-house AI chips.Meanwhile, the prospect of serious competition in AI chips from Intel still seems remote. While new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company will aim to build ""full stack AI solutions"" — spanning hardware, software and services — of the type that Nvidia already offers, he didn't put a timeline on when it might bring a competitive AI processor to the market.In January, Intel announced it wouldn't bring its next AI data center product Falcon Shores to market. Instead, it said it would focus its efforts on developing another product called Jaguar Shores.""We still have a Jaguar Shores product on our road map...We know that is a segment of the data center market that we're not competing in today, and we need a robust portfolio as all the customers are looking for alternatives,"" said Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel's Product business, on a call with analysts on Thursday.On Friday, Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst Joseph Moore also dismissed concerns that demand for AI chips is weakening. ""The idea that we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand,"" he wrote.Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom both fell 0.5% in early trading.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

2 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks That Boast Solid Growth Potential,1745501640000,"Wall Street has been exhibiting wild swings, driven by growing uncertainty around the new U.S. administration’s economic tariffs. These tariffs are expected to drive up consumer prices, thus curbing spending and weighing on the U.S. economy. In such a scenario, investors have become defensive and shifted their focus to products that provide stability and safety in a rocky market. As a result, the appeal for dividend stocks has risen. Though these stocks do not offer dramatic price appreciation, they tend to outperform in a choppy market and can reduce the volatility of a portfolio. In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Two stocks — Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Primoris Services PRIM — seem solid choices in this regard.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. A history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth Greater Than Zero : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth Greater Than Zero : This represents stocks with a strong record of revenue growth.5-Year Historical EPS Growth Greater Than Zero : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate Greater Than Zero : This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow Less Than M-Industry : A ratio less than M-industry indicates that a stock is undervalued in that industry, and an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by a company.52-Week Price Change Greater Than S&P 500 (Market Weight) : This ensures that a stock has appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank : Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in every market environment.Growth Score of B or Better : Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.These few criteria have narrowed down the universe from more than 7,700 stocks to just 3.Here are two of the three stocks that fit the bill:California-based Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices focused on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products.

Micron vs. Broadcom: Which Stock is the Smarter Semiconductor Bet?,1747058760000,"Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO are both entrenched in high-growth semiconductor arenas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and cloud infrastructure, but they take radically different paths to capture value. Micron is a dominant memory chip maker, while Broadcom specializes in networking, custom silicon and infrastructure software.Both companies have seen share price fluctuations in 2025 amid geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. While MU shares have risen 2% year to date, AVGO dropped 10.2%. Yet with AI adoption accelerating, which stock stands out as the smarter semiconductor investment today? Let’s find out.Micron: AI Memory Boom Aids, Margin Worries LingerMicron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, Micron revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Despite Micron's efforts to capitalize on rising AI-related demand, margin pressures and pricing challenges raise red flags. While Micron’s top-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was impressive, its profitability came under significant pressure. The company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9%, down from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning is the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This weaker-than-expected outlook, despite record sales in its HBM segment, indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist.Broadcom: Profitable, Predictable and Primed for AIMeanwhile, Broadcom offers investors a more diversified and durable growth profile. The company is deeply embedded in next-generation AI infrastructure through its custom application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) and high-performance networking chips, which are fueling its top-line growth.Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Gen AI models, and they require a complex integration of compute, memory and I/O capabilities to achieve the essential performance at lower power consumption and costs. Broadcom expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion.What’s more impressive is that Broadcom is already sampling the world’s first 3nm XPU chips and plans to launch a 2nm version using advanced 3.5D packaging later this year. The company targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. It believes that by 2027, each of its three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric.Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and networks is expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, DELL, Juniper and Super Micro Computer, has been a key catalyst.From a financial perspective, Broadcom consistently delivers gross margins above 70% and operating margins above 60%, driven by its high-value custom silicon business and enterprise software portfolio. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP EPS soared 45.5% on 25% higher revenues. Looking forward, Broadcom expects total revenues in the second quarter to surge 19% year over year to $14.9 billion.EPS Estimate Trends: MU Picks Up Steam, AVGO Holds SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Micron’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 41% and 433%, respectively. However, the estimate revision trend for MU’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS has remained highly volatile.Micron EPS Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 21% and 36%, respectively. However, unlike Micron, estimates for Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS have demonstrated a steady upward revision trend. This stability is a testament to the company’s predictable performance in a volatile sector.Broadcom EPS Estimate Revision TrendValuation: MU is Cheaper, but AVGO Deserves the PremiumMicron is trading at a forward sales multiple of 2.24X, way below Broadcom’s 14.48X.Broadcom does seem pricey compared to Micron. However, AVGO’s higher valuation is backed by superior profitability and a structurally more diversified business. The company boasts steady gross and operating margins compared to MU’s more variable margin profile.Micron’s falling profitability raises questions about its ability to capitalize on the booming AI market. If the company cannot maintain healthy margins, future earnings growth could be constrained.Conclusion: Broadcom is the Better Long-Term PlayBoth Micron and Broadcom are riding the same megatrends — AI, cloud and data centers — but they’re doing so from vastly different positions of strength.Micron has upside potential due to its leadership in AI memory. However, that promise is being weighed down by margin pressure and pricing volatility. It’s still a play on memory cycles more than a structural AI winner.Meanwhile, Broadcom brings more stability to the table with strong fundamentals, durable earnings, and a balanced mix of AI-driven hardware and enterprise software. While its valuation is higher, it’s supported by margin strength and earnings consistency.So, for investors seeking a smarter semiconductor bet amid global uncertainty, Broadcom remains the more compelling choice.Currently, AVGO has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a must-pick compared to MU, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Broadcom Stock Down 11% in a Month: Should You Buy the Dip?,1745434800000,"Broadcom AVGO shares have dropped 11.4% in the past month. The company has been suffering from the ongoing sell-off in technology stocks amid rising fears of a recession following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on top trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada, which has increased the chances of a trade war. Broadcom generated roughly 20% of net revenues from shipments to China (including Hong Kong) in fiscal 2024.However, we believe the dip offers a massive opportunity for investors to buy the stock. An innovative portfolio, rich partner base, solid VMware business and strong balance sheet, as well as free cash flow generating ability, are attractive for growth-oriented investors. Let’s dig deep to find out more.AVGO Stock Performance  Strong Portfolio to Boost Broadcom’s ProspectsStrong demand for Broadcom’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), designed to support AI and machine learning and make these tasks more efficient, aids top-line growth. Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. Custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of ASIC, are necessary to train Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. AVGO’s innovative portfolio is a key catalyst. The company’s next-generation 3-nanometer XPUs are the first of their kind to market in that process node. Broadcom is on track for volume shipment to hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO is now planning to develop the industry’s first 2-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D and targets scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers.AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as its three hyperscaler customers have started to develop their own XPUs. It believes that by 2027, each of AVGO’s three hyperscalers plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. The company has expanded its clientele with the addition of four new hyperscalers (although AVGO considers them as partners currently).Broadcom’s rich partner base, including NVIDIA, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies DELL, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. These factors are expected to drive strong AI revenues. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. Semiconductor revenues are expected to surge 17% year over year to $14.9 billion.Growing Security Portfolio Aids AVGOBroadcom’s focus on delivering AI-powered, proactive security to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats has been noteworthy. In March 2025, AVGO introduced updates to VMware vDefend, improving security planning, lifecycle management, and scalability for VMware Cloud Foundation with new tools like the Security Segmentation Assessment and Report, optimized micro-segmentation, and advanced Network Detection and Response, all aimed at improving threat prevention and operational efficiency.Last week, AVGO introduced Incident Prediction, which extends the security feature of Adaptive Protection, a unique capability of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C). SES-C is an integrated endpoint security platform that delivers cloud-based protection with AI-guided security management, all on a single agent/console architecture.Meanwhile, Broadcom benefits from a strong balance sheet and its free cash-flow-generating ability. As of Feb. 2, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $9.31 billion, and Broadcom generated $6.11 billion in cash flow from operations. Free cash flow was $6.01 billion and accounted for 40% of revenue at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2025.The strong balance sheet is helping AVGO pay consistent dividends and return cash to shareholders through buybacks. Early this month, Broadcom announced that its board has authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock through Dec. 31, 2025.AVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Upward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.60 per share, up 0.6% over the past 30 days, indicating 35.52% year-over-year growth.Broadcom Inc.

QuoteThe consensus estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating 42.73% year-over-year growth.AVGO’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.44%.

"Meta, Walmart, and Other Stocks This AI Trader Is Selling Amid the Market Uncertainty — Barrons.com",1747026000000,"By Elsa OhlenSome would say that trading hasn't been easy amid the chaos and uncertainty that has characterized markets recently. But an artificial intelligence-driven stock picker has a clear plan: Dump Meta and Walmart and load up on stocks that have outperformed recently.Tariffs, and their impact on the economic climate have weighed heavily on stocks — and lifted them sharply as effects appeared not to be as bad as first expected.SoftBank-backed Qraft Technologies is one company capitalizing on AI technology to pick stock for its exchange-traded funds. The Hong Kong-based business has three U.S.-listed ETFs with a combined asset value of roughly $50 million.Their selling point? All decisions are 100% controlled by an AI model and based on different investment strategies and investors' risk appetite.May was an interesting month, said Justin Tam, ETF Lead at Qraft. It showed how different their two biggest ETFs, the momentum fund AMOM and the more defensive option QRFT, are.AMOM targets stocks on the rise on the assumption that they'll continue to outperform and is always looking for growth opportunities.Nvidia is still the fund's largest holding, with about 9% allocated to the chip maker stock. But there were a few surprise removals this month as well. It dropped its entire holding in Meta, which had accounted for 6% of the fund previously, after the Facebook-parent traded largely flat in April. The removal indicates that the AI predicts the stock won't see gains anytime soon.Walmart was also completely sold off after a solid month with a 10% gain, which Tam says could be profit-taking.Chip maker Broadcom, drugmaker Eli Lilly, analytics software company Palantir, and streamer Netflix were notable additions to AMOM's portfolio in May. Those stocks all saw impressive gains between 9% and 40% in April.One argument in favor of AI handling your investments is that an AI trader won't be influenced by emotions, fear or attachment to previous decisions. The counterargument is that it lacks intuition and the ability to imagine things can become different than they were.The ETFs reallocate assets on the second trading day of every month. That means the last time they rebalanced was on April 2, or Trump's so-called Liberation Day. ""It wasn't pretty,"" Tam recalls, referring to the heavy market losses in the weeks following the president's tariff announcement. ""Things can change really, really quickly in this current condition. It's really about just finding the proper risk tolerance, I'd say, for the everyday investor.""While Liberation Day was painful for AMOM, the fund bounced back as most tariffs were put on a 90-day pause shortly after being announced, ending the month up nearly 4%. It's still down just over 10% so far this year, largely due to a ""very ugly March,"" where tech, where AMOM is heavily overweight, took a big dive.The momentum benchmark, the iShares MSCI momentum fund ( MTUM), however, had managed to rise 2% in 2025 by the end of April.The company's more defensive QRFT ETF on the other hand, has been outperforming the broader market. It's down less than 2% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 4% drawdown. ""We're crediting that to a more defensive allocation over the past few months,"" Tam says.That fund is slightly overweight on information technology, financials, and healthcare compared with the S&P 500. However, among its 10 biggest holdings are all Magnificent 7 companies: Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla. It also holds a decent chunk of Eli Lilly, Walmart, and Broadcom.Diversification was the number one thing Qraft had in mind when designing QRFT. The model uses a multifactor approach and includes 350 large-cap U.S.-listed stocks. It makes no big bets on any particular name or industry, which Tam thinks is ""very appropriate in the current market climate.""""Timing the market is very, very hard; some would say impossible. The more that you rebalance your portfolio, the greater the risk that you're wrong and you get hit by the whipsaw effect,"" he says.While AIs are good at processing huge amounts of data, they lack human intuition. Now, given the president's proven ability to surprise the market, it's far from a given that human intuition will beat hard, cold — and backward-looking — data.""Nobody can predict what's going to happen tomorrow, not even AI,"" says Tam.Write to Elsa Ohlen at elsa.ohlen@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

A new threat has also emerged: President Trump's recent comments calling for 100% tariffs on films produced outside of the U.S.Disney shares jumped 11% Wednesday, making it the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Berkshire HathawayThe Oracle of Omaha is retiring.At the conclusion of Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3, legendary investor Warren Buffett said he plans to step down as chief executive in December.Greg Abel, who has been on deck to succeed Buffett as CEO since 2021, will take the reins on Jan. 1. Buffett will remain the conglomerate's chairman.Buffett, who is 94, has led the company for the past 60 years. His retirement announcement surprised shareholders, as many thought that Buffett would remain CEO until his death.Berkshire shares lost 5.1% Monday.Ford MotorFord and Mattel joined the growing group of companies scrapping annual guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.Ford on Tuesday reported a steep decline in quarterly profit and suspended its annual guidance, saying it couldn't predict the full impact of President Trump's levies. The automaker said tariffs could cut $1.5 billion from a key measure of profit.Mattel also scrapped its annual forecast. The maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels said it could increase U.S. toy prices, as the company is bracing for a $270 million tariff hit. Mattel is also moving more of its production out of China.Ford shares rose 2.7% Tuesday, while Mattel gained 2.9%.Cleveland-CliffsAs President Trump seeks to build up American steel demand, one of the major U.S. steelmakers is shrinking.Cleveland-Cliffs on Wednesday said it would pause or slow operations at six plants after posting a wider first-quarter loss and lower revenue. The production cuts and changes in operations are expected to affect about 2,000 jobs and save the steelmaker $300 million a year.While steel prices climbed as customers bought up steel ahead of Trump's tariffs on imported metal, that rally has stalled. Now, buyers are holding off on placing big orders in an uncertain U.S. economy.Cleveland-Cliffs shares plummeted 16% Thursday.BroadcomU.S. chip stocks got a boost, thanks to the possibility of a reprieve from tight export controls.The Trump administration plans to overhaul controversial regulations that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips individual countries can buy, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday.A White House spokeswoman said that the Commerce Department plans to replace the rule — commonly known as AI diffusion — which was set to go into effect May 15.The decision is a temporary boon for the tech titans, but many executives are still bracing for tight restrictions. The Trump administration recently cracked down on Nvidia selling a specialized AI chip to China, causing the company to take a $5.5 billion charge.Broadcom shares rose 1.5% Thursday.BoeingThe new U.S. trade deal with the U.K. includes some good news for Boeing.President Trump on Thursday announced that his administration and the U.K. had made a trade deal pact, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a British airline would buy $10 billion worth of Boeing planes.In exchange for the U.K. purchasing the jets and giving American farmers greater access to U.K. markets, the Trump administration agreed to roll back tariffs imposed on British steel and automobiles. The U.K. is also cutting tariffs on some U.S. beef imports and on ethanol.On Friday, British Airways owner IAG said it has ordered 32 Boeing planes, confirming purchases touted by Lutnick the day before.Boeing shares gained 3.3% Thursday.Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ's What's News podcast.

Intel Plans to Slash More Than 20% of Workforce: Report. The Stock Is Rising. — Barrons.com,1745419020000,"By Adam ClarkIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has promised a radical shake-up of the beleaguered chip company and his latest move could be mass layoffs.The chip company plans to announce the reduction of more than 20% of its workforce this week, Bloomberg reported late Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Intel declined to comment.The reported cuts would affect around 22,000 workers, based on Intel's global workforce of 108,900 as at the end of 2024. Last year, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 employees.In midmorning trading, the stock was up 7.0% at $20.87. It has dropped 43% over the past 12 months.Tan was appointed CEO last month and is looking to prioritize its core chip design and chip-manufacturing businesses. While he was widely expected to implement substantial job cuts, theIntel's first-quarter earnings come on Thursday. It is expected to report a net loss of $987 million, according to FactSet; on an adjusted basis, the forecast is a $9 million profit.Intel executives said recently that the company had begun low-volume testing on its new 18A chip-manufacturing process, which it hopes will give it a technological lead against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.""We do see downside for Intel as somewhat limited with investors in our view more likely to focus on the potential for 1) a split of Intel's fab and design businesses (a result we see as unlikely for now), and 2) Intel's progress with 18A,"" wrote Wedbush analysts on Wednesday.The Wedbush team kept a Neutral rating on the stock but reduced its price target to $19 from $20.While producing Intel's own chips will provide some validation for its costly chip-manufacturing efforts, the real test will be whether it can attract significant external customers for the 18A process. Nvidia and Broadcom are running tests on the process, Reuters reported previously.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Nvidia, AMD, and Other Chip Stocks Rally. Tariffs Fears Are Lifting — but There Is Another Concern to Watch. — Barrons.com",1745418780000,"By Adam ClarkNvidia stock jumped 4.4% early Wednesday amid a broader market rally after President Donald Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on China to reach a deal.The chip maker's shares were trading around $103.25 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Tuesday. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.7% and Broadcom was up 5.2% in morning trading. The iShares Semiconductor exchange-traded fund was up 5.7%.President Trump on Tuesday said U.S.-imposed tariffs of 145% on imported goods from China will come down ""substantially"" after the two sides negotiate a deal. The Nasdaq Composite was up 3.9%.While lower tariffs on China won't have much of a direct effect on Nvidia, which sources the majority of its chips from Taiwan, it could reduce fears over retaliation and the potential level of sector-specific levies on imported semiconductors. Trump has said additional tariffs on semiconductors are coming, and the administration has restricted Nvidia's chip sales in China. The administration also hasn't made clear how it intends to apply former President Joe Biden's so-called AI diffusion rules to control chip exports before they take effect on May 15.""In our view, the upcoming AI Diffusion Rule remains the biggest near-term risk, with our worst-case scenario assuming another 10% sales and up to 11% of EPS [earnings per share] shaved off from our new base case,"" wrote BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya in a research note.Arya kept a Buy rating on Nvidia stock, noting it is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of around 19 times its forecast profit for 2026.

Micron Stock Plunges 28% in a Month: Should You Hold or Exit?,1745412900000,"Micron Technology, Inc. MU shares have plunged 27.8% over the past month and underperformed the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which is down 13.9%. MU stock has also underperformed major semiconductor players, including Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.MU One-Month Price Return PerformanceThis steep decline raises the question: Should investors cut their losses and exit, or is the stock worth holding onto? While the near-term headwinds are real, MU’s long-term growth story remains intact, making a strong case for holding the stock.Why Did Micron Struggle?The company’s recent slump is part of a larger tech pullback triggered by fears of an escalating tariff war and slowing economic growth. The situation is compounded by a growing concern over its deteriorating gross margin.In its latest financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s non-GAAP gross margin declined to 37.9% from 39.5% in the previous quarter, marking a sharp sequential fall. This deterioration was driven by weaker NAND flash pricing and ongoing startup costs at its new DRAM production facility in Idaho.More concerning for the investors was the company’s margin outlook. For the third quarter, Micron guided for a gross margin of 36.5% at the midpoint, signaling further compression. This dim outlook indicates that margin pressures are likely to persist in the near term.Despite these challenges, Micron’s dominant market position and promising long-term outlook make it a stock worth holding onto.Micron’s Promising Long-Term OutlookWhile near-term profitability guidance is uninspiring, Micron’s long-term prospects are bright. Should the company hit its third-quarter targets, it would still reflect impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 29% and a 153% jump in EPS.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 41% and 30%, respectively. The consensus mark for EPS suggests a robust year-over-year improvement of 427% for fiscal 2025 and 58% for fiscal 2026.Micron also has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.7%.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteMicron’s strategic position in the memory and storage chip market, a critical component for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, positions it to capitalize on an expected surge in AI-related capital expenditures over the coming years.Positive Industry Trends Aid Micron’s ProspectsMicron’s position in high-demand segments such as AI, data center, automotive and industrial IoT places it at the forefront of the semiconductor industry's evolution. The explosion of AI applications has significantly increased demand for advanced memory solutions, such as DRAM and NAND. Micron’s investments in cutting-edge DRAM and 3D NAND technologies ensure it remains competitive and poised to capitalize on these trends.Micron’s diversification strategy is noteworthy. By reducing reliance on consumer electronics, which are more susceptible to demand swings, and focusing on stable sectors like automotive and data centers, Micron mitigates revenue volatility. This balance reinforces its resilience in an industry often impacted by cyclical trends.Additionally, Micron is riding a powerful wave of demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, especially as AI workloads surge. The company has made significant strides in AI-optimized memory solutions, with its HBM3E products gaining attention for their superior power efficiency and bandwidth.In January 2025, NVIDIA revealed that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), solidifying Micron’s positioning in the HBM market. Earlier this year, MU revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026, with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron’s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.Valuation: Micron is UndervaluedValuation-wise, Micron is undervalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of B.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales (P/S), MU shares are trading at 1.86X, significantly lower than the sector’s 5.06X.The stock’s P/S ratio is also lower than major semiconductor players, including Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices. At present, Broadcom, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices have forward 12-month P/S multiples of 11.88X, 11.79X and 4.17X, respectively.Conclusion: Hold Micron for NowMicron’s recent sell-off reflects short-term headwinds, but the long-term growth story remains compelling. With its strong positioning in AI and data center markets, along with an attractive valuation, holding Micron stock is the prudent choice for investors willing to navigate near-term volatility.Currently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Wolfspeed Stock Plunges as Analysts Weigh In. Chip Maker's Debt Is the Worry. — Barrons.com,1746805020000,"By Brian SwintShares of semiconductor maker Wolfspeed plunged Friday as Wall Street analysts issued negative research on the stock.Earnings that came in line with expectations weren't enough to reassure investors concerned with the company's debt levels.The problem is that Wolfspeed, which produces silicon wafers in the U.S., was promised $750 million under former President Joe Biden's Chips Act. Receiving it may be a problem as President Donald Trump tries to undo his predecessor's work. At the same time, the company has a $575 million payment due to creditors next year.Short interest in Wolfspeed, a measure of how much of a company's stock has been borrowed for bets that the price would drop, has taken off this year. The shares went through a short squeeze last month as investors bid up the stock price, forcing short sellers to buy to close out their bearish bets.Wolfspeed is slimming down its management team by 30%, the company said Thursday during its first earnings call with new CEO Robert Feurle. Chairman Tom Werner said the company is still working with lenders ""to address our capital structure so that Wolfspeed has a strong financial foundation."" Executives didn't take questions from analysts.CFO Neill Reynolds, on the earnings call, said Wolfspeed will start naming the risk of continuing as a ""going concern"" in future filings as it negotiates with creditors, possibly in court.Wolfspeed shares plunged 26% to $3.30 Friday. The stock has traded as high as about $7.50 this year and as low as about $2.50. Shares have lost more than 80% in the past 12 months.William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer suspended coverage of the company, withdrawing the firm's previous Market Perform rating.Others stuck with coverage but downgraded the shares.""Wolfspeed faces significant financial challenges in a sluggish macro environment with financial losses, high leverage, Chips Act funding challenges underpinning doubts over going concern,"" said Atif Malik, an analyst at Citigroup. The bank cut its target price to $3 from $7 and downgraded the stock to Sell.J.P. Morgan analysts Samik Chatterjee and Joseph Cardoso downgraded the stock to Underweight in a note Friday morning, without giving a price target. It will be hard for the company to reach its goal of generating positive cash flow in the coming fiscal year, they wrote.Over at Charter Equity Research, analyst Jack Egan rates the shares Market Underperform. ""Difficulties refinancing the debt, continued cash burn and slowing demand in materials increased the specter of bankruptcy and will depress the stock for the foreseeable future,"" Egan wrote.Piper Sandler analysts led by Harsh Kumar weren't as pessimistic, but did move their price target to $6 after the results. ""WOLF has many steps ahead of itself to complete its turnaround but is course-correcting appropriately at this time,"" they wrote in a note.Wolfspeed competes with chip makers like Alpha & Omega and Indie Semiconductor, both of whose shares rose Friday.

CRDO Tanks 33% in 3 Months: Should You Hold the Stock or Make an Exit?,1746798420000,"Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd CRDO stock has slipped 33.3% over the past three months, significantly more than the Electronic-Semiconductors industry’s decline of 16.4%. The broader Computer and Technology sector and S&P 500 Composite have registered declines of 11.5% and 7.8%, respectively, over the same time frame. The markets since April have been affected by evolving U.S. trade policy and diminishing macroeconomic visibility. Price PerformanceCRDO gained 6.1% yesterday and closed trading at $51.39, but the stock is down 41% below its 52-week high of $86.69. This is likely to spook investors as they contemplate how to strategize their investment now. The natural question is: Should you stay invested or exit now? Let’s weigh the pros and cons of this AI stock and see whether it is worth staying invested or not.AI Boom to Drive CRDO Top LineCredo is a provider of high-performance serial connectivity solutions for the data infrastructure market. Amid exponential data growth and rapid AI proliferation, market demand for faster and energy-efficient connectivity solutions continues to increase. This bodes well for Credo.One of Credo’s key strengths lies in its Active Electrical Cables (AEC) product line, which posted triple-digit sequential growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The growth is driven by its increasing adoption in the data center market. The demand for AECs is increasing as ZeroFlap AECs offer more than 100 times improved reliability than laser-based optical solutions. This made AECs an increasingly attractive option for data center applications, contributing to the new expansion of AEC usage and further solidifying Credo Technology’s position in the market.CRDO Focuses on Product LaunchesCredo is also focused on expanding its product portfolio to include a portfolio of PCIe solutions, which will address the growing demand for AI scale-out and scale-up networks. The company expects the PCIe products to considerably expand its total addressable market. This expansion into PCIe connectivity further solidifies the company's competitive positioning in the high-performance computing and AI markets.Momentum in the optical business, particularly for Optical Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), bodes well. In April 2025, CRDO unveiled the innovative Lark Optical DSP family, engineered to transform 800G optical transceivers. The Lark portfolio has two distinct optical DSP products. The Lark 800 is a high-performance, low-power DSP optimized for fully retimed 800G transceivers, designed to meet the stringent power and cooling requirements of hyperscale AI data centers. The Lark 850 is an ultra-low-power 800G Linear Receive Optics DSP, consuming under 10W, making it an ideal solution for AI-driven data environments where power efficiency is exceptional.Growing Demand for RetimersCRDO’s PCIe retimers and Ethernet retimers saw strong customer interest, especially for scale-out networks in AI servers. This growing demand underscores the increasing importance of high-performance solutions in the rapidly expanding AI server market. PCIe retimer demand is expected to exceed $1 billion by 2027, positioning Credo Technology for significant future revenue growth. CRDO Provides Strong Q4 OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO expects revenues between $155 million and $165 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $160 million, suggesting growth of 163.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, CRDO reported $135 million in revenues, up 87% sequentially and 154% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%. This surge was mainly driven by its largest hyperscale customer, which significantly scaled the production of AI platforms, reflecting the growing demand for AI-powered connectivity solutions.Challenges Aplenty for CRDODespite Credo’s strong performance and innovative solutions, several challenges pose headwinds to its prospects. CRDO’s business is heavily tilted toward AI-related infrastructure and the hyperscale cloud market spending. While these segments are currently experiencing high growth, they are also cyclically dependent on AI capex spending, which could decelerate after initial buildouts.Credo’s non-GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal third quarter surged 16% sequentially to $43.8 million, primarily due to higher headcount. Increasing costs could become a problem if the revenue growth does not keep pace.In the last reported quarter, 86% of revenue came from a single end customer. This intense customer concentration risk can impact revenues as the company becomes highly vulnerable to the loss of business from those clients. To diversify its base, CRDO added that it has two additional hyperscalers in qualification and has already achieved volume production with three others. The company expects to ramp up with these two hyperscalers in fiscal 2026.These factors, along with increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties, may impact CRDO’s growth trajectory. Credo competes with semiconductor giants like Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc . MRVL.Analysts also seem wary as reflected in unchanged revisions for earnings estimates in the past 60 days. CRDO Falls Steeper Than PeersCRDO’s 33.3% decline is also much steeper than peers like Broadcom and Cirrus Logic, Inc . CRUS. Broadcom and Cirrus Logic have declined 11.6% and 6.5%, respectively. However, Marvell’s stock has declined 48.9% in the same time frame. CRDO Trades at a PremiumCredo Technology stock is also not so cheap, as its Value Style Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, CRDO is trading at 12.92, higher than the Electronic-Semiconductors sector’s multiple of 6.97.In comparison, Broadcom trades at a forward 12-month P/S multiple of 14.46, while Cirrus Logic and Marvell Technology are trading at a multiple of 2.76 and 5.71, respectively.Hold CRDO for NowWhile Credo appears well-positioned in the AI-driven connectivity space, there are several factors that could exert downward pressure on the stock.

QuoteYelp’s Q1 in DetailYelp’s advertising revenues (95.2% of total revenues) increased 8% year over year to $342 million, primarily driven by an increase in revenues from Yelp ad products and, to some extent, the addition of revenues from the RepairPal Network.

In the last reported quarter, LRCX delivered an earnings surprise of 4.6%. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lam Research Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lam Research Corporation QuoteEarnings Whispers for LRCXOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lam Research this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.15%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: LRCX carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Likely to Influence LRCX’s Quarterly PerformanceLam Research has been riding the wave of a strong rebound in the semiconductor industry, driven by the surging demand for memory and advanced AI applications. The rise in spending on AI and machine learning, particularly with the growing influence of Generative AI, is likely to have provided a significant boost to the company's performance in the fiscal third quarter. The increasing need for advanced AI-centric chips has become a key growth catalyst.Heightened dynamic random access memory (DRAM) spending, especially in response to demand for high-bandwidth memory, is likely to have played in Lam Research's favor. The company's momentum in 3D DRAM and advanced packaging technologies is also expected to have added to its strong performance. At the same time, ongoing technological advancements are pushing NAND spending higher, which is likely to contribute to Lam’s quarterly results.Lam Research’s focus on expanding semiconductor fabrication capabilities, along with its heavy investment in research and development, positions it well in a competitive landscape. Its innovation through Semiverse solutions, particularly in high-aspect-ratio memory hole etch for NAND, is likely to have fueled this progress. LRCX’s strategic investments in cutting-edge technologies are likely to have bolstered its performance in the foundry and logic segment, while the increasing adoption of 3D architectures is expected to have supported growth in its etch and deposition services.The company’s robust suite of tools, which enable foundry logic inflections, is likely to have secured strong customer traction. With the accelerating deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), Lam Research’s semiconductor and memory solutions remain in high demand, reinforcing its market position in the fiscal third quarter.All these factors are likely to have driven growth in system revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate forecasts fiscal third-quarter system revenues at $2.94 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 22.6%, underscoring Lam Research’s continued strength in the evolving tech landscape. The consensus mark for the Customer Support segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 22.7%.LRCX Stock Price Performance & ValuationLam Research shares have plunged 26.5% over the past year, underperforming the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductors industry, which has risen 6.2%. The stock has also underperformed its industry peers, including Broadcom AVGO, QUALCOMM QCOM and Marvell Technology MRVL. Broadcom stock has soared 39.7% over the past year, while shares of QUALCOMM and Marvell Technology have plunged 14.7% and 17.8%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceLet us look at the value Lam Research offers investors at current levels. Currently, LRCX is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 16.94X compared with the industry’s 21.71X. Compared with industry peers, the stock trades at lower multiples than Broadcom and Marvell Technology, while at higher multiple than QUALCOMM. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and QUALCOMM have forward 12-month P/E multiples of 23.8X, 17.68X and 11.15X, respectively.Forward 12-Month P/E RatioInvestment Thesis for Lam Research StockLam Research has long been a pillar of the chip equipment world, especially in etch and deposition technology, which are critical for producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced packaging technologies essential for AI workloads. These leading-edge technologies are helping it capitalize on the opportunities from the booming demand for AI and datacenter chips, which require advanced fabrication technologies.In 2024, Lam Research’s shipments for gate-all-around nodes and advanced packaging exceeded $1 billion, and management expects this figure to triple to more than $3 billion by 2025. Additionally, the industry’s migration to backside power distribution and dry-resist processing presents further growth opportunities for Lam Research’s cutting-edge fabrication solutions.Nonetheless, Lam Research is not immune to risks. U.S.-China trade tensions pose a significant challenge. China accounted for 31% of its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues, down from 37% in the prior quarter. During the last reported quarter earnings call, the company revealed that $700 million in expected sales from restricted Chinese customers will not materialize in 2025, creating a noticeable sales gap.Additionally, declining demand for mature-node semiconductor equipment is weighing on Lam Research’s foundry business. Foundry revenues fell from 41% of system sales in the first quarter to 35% in the second quarter, reflecting weaker demand. With TSMC and other foundries slowing their mature-node spending, Lam Research’s growth in this segment could remain sluggish.Conclusion: Hold Lam Research for NowWhile geopolitical risks and mature-node weakness could create short-term headwinds, Lam Research’s discounted valuation, solid financial performance and strategic focus on AI-driven growth make it a compelling long-term hold. The company’s expanding market share in AI and datacenter fabrication, coupled with innovative product launches, strengthens its competitive positioning.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:7990c75bd094b:0-lam-research-set-to-report-q3-earnings-how-to-play-the-stock/
Nvidia and 29 Other Stocks to Play AI — Barrons.com,1746732720000,"By Teresa RivasWhile tariffs have caused tech stocks to bend, they won't break, a longtime bull says. It's all thanks to artificial intelligence.The technology sector has been one of the harder-hit areas during the 2025 market downturn. Even as stocks have started to rebound amid hopes for tariff negotiations, the Nasdaq Composite is still down more than 8% year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's loss, and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund is off some 13%.Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe that tech's underdog status won't last. Perhaps most obviously, the artificial intelligence genie can't be put back in the bottle. AI is becoming increasingly mainstream, whether it's people talking to chatbots, retailers using it to personalize their promotional efforts, or companies hoping to improve efficiency and productivity.In short, the AI revolution will continue to play out for years to come. That's the stance of Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, a longtime tech bull. He calls AI the fourth industrial revolution in a new note Thursday, arguing that ""it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years.""That creates an opportunity for multiple companies — and their investors — to win. He highlights 30 tech companies that he says will be long-term winners across six areas: hyperscalers, software, consumer internet, cybersecurity, autonomous and robotics, and semiconductors and hardware.Often thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" of AI, semiconductors and hardware makers are the second largest group in his list. They have also been some of the most well-known AI beneficiaries, including Nvidia — Ives calls co-founder Jensen Huang the ""godfather of AI.""Naturally Ives still likes the stock, along with Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. He says AMD will continue to strengthen its position and gain market share, and Taiwan Semi — the world's leading chip foundry — will make it a beneficiary of the global increase in AI investments. In addition, Micron has ""an enviable position within memory,"" while Broadcom, the world leader in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for cloud and AI, will benefit from the buildout of these technologies.More than 15% of cloud services now include some AI component, making hyperscalers another area of huge investments. Major companies in the space ""are expected to spend $325 billion+ in 2025 through AI capital expenditures, representing 40% year-over-year growth and over $100 billion year-over-year increase as data center buildouts continue with the AI Arms Race only just beginning,"" Ives writes."" Microsoft is currently in the driver's seat,"" he says, adding that Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, and Oracle aren't far behind.With both people and businesses ramping up their use of AI, consumer internet companies stand to benefit, too, Ives says. Positives could include AI customer service, to improved search, personalization of ads, and dynamic pricing.His favorite picks stateside are Apple — he estimates about a quarter of the world's population will eventually access AI through an Apple device — and Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is still seeing strong underlying demand. Among Chinese stocks, he highlights Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu. It's becoming ""clearer [Alibaba] could be one of the winners in the China AI Arms Race,"" he writes, while Baidu is another major Chinese player poised to do well.Robotics is another key area, as the ""global autonomous vehicle market size is expected to reach $3.22 trillion by 2033 representing a 36% compound annual growth rate,"" Ives writes. Tesla's robo-taxis earn it a spot here, while nuclear energy start-up Oklo will help meet the increasing power demands of automation.Of course, all of these advancements make cybersecurity more important than ever. Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, and CyberArk Software are his picks here.Software is the largest category, as 1 billion apps will be with generative AI by 2028, Ive says, noting ""the software era of AI use cases [is] already under way."" Palantir Technologies, Salesforce, IBM, ServiceNow, Snowflake, Adobe, Pegasystems, MongoDB, C3.ai, Elastic, Innodata, and SoundHound are on his list of winners.Tariffs remain a worry, though Ives predicts they won't dent the AI revolution in the long run.He isn't the only optimist on this front. 22V Research's Dennis DeBusschere writes Thursday that investors will likely return to megacap tech stocks like the Magnificent Seven because the U.S. economy will likely avoid a recession, though it might slow.""High-quality, monopolistic companies with strong earnings momentum are favorable in our base case of an economic muddle through, especially after large price drawdowns,"" he writes.Time to ask ChatGPT if tech is cheap enough to buy the dip.Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Chips Stocks Rise as U.S. Plans to Overhaul Curbs on AI Chip Exports,1746716580000,"By Kelly CloonanChip stocks rose across the board as the Trump administration plans to overhaul export regulations on U.S. chip companies.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.8% to $104.20 on Thursday. Intel rose 2.3%, while Qualcomm and Broadcom both ticked up around 1%. Nvidia shares remained flat.The Commerce Department plans to replace a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would limit how many artificial-intelligence chips countries like India, Switzerland, Mexico and Israel can buy, a spokeswoman said.The rule, commonly known as AI diffusion, had been set to go into effect May 15. It aimed to prevent other countries from routing U.S. chips to adversaries like China, but was seen as controversial across the tech industry. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle argued it would harm American companies' business prospects abroad without doing much to hinder China.Other regulations appear to remain for now, though. The Trump administration recently issued new export-licensing requirements covering Nvidia's H20 chips, which the company said would result in a $5.5 billion charge on its quarterly earnings. AMD's MI308 processors also are affected, with the company expecting charges of $800 million.Write to Kelly Cloonan at kelly.cloonan@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010812:0-chips-stocks-rise-as-u-s-plans-to-overhaul-curbs-on-ai-chip-exports/

That follows a 7.4% drop on Wednesday after news broke that U.S. exports of certain AI chips would now be subject to new licensing requirements.While not an outright ban, it appears no licenses have been granted.Broadcom stock fell 0.9% to $172.96, and Micron stock dropped 2.6% to $67.56.

Broadcom’s Apple Relationship: AI Opportunity Meets Tariff Risk,1744899960000,"[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] As one of the largest companies in the world,  semiconductor stock Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO naturally has relationships with some of the other most prominent firms on the globe. Due to the market fixation on  AI , many have become aware of Broadcom’s relationship with Google's parent company, Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG . Alphabet developed its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) with Broadcom’s chip technology, which it uses to train its AI models.However, outside of AI, Broadcom also has a historical relationship with the largest public company in the world, Apple NASDAQ:AAPL . Apple uses Broadcom chips in its wireless consumer devices. This relationship may take on a new form, as Broadcom has reportedly been working with Apple to develop AI chips.The analysis below will dive into Broadcom’s relationship with Apple . Just how significant is Broadcom’s non-AI Apple business? How exposed could Broadcom be to tariff-related risks within this business line? Additionally, is Apple actually trying to build AI chips with Broadcom technology, and what type of upside could this mean for Broadcom if so?Apple: Broadcom’s Wireless StalwartBroadcom’s non-AI relationship with Apple is big . Before fiscal Q1 2025, Broadcom categorized its semiconductor revenues as follows: networking, wireless, server storage, broadband, and industrial. In Q4 2024, the company brought in approximately $2.2 billion in wireless revenue. Almost all of this likely came from Apple.Press releases clearly show that Broadcom makes chips used in Apple products. This includes things like WiFi cards and 5G radio frequency components. In its Q2 2024 earnings call, Broadcom referenced a North American wireless customer, saying that it “represents all of our wireless business.” Reading between the lines, they are clearly talking about Apple. Overall, this $2.2 billion in wireless revenue represented nearly 16% of Broadcom’s total $14 billion in revenue that quarter.Clearly, Apple is a huge part of Broadcom’s business . So, how could tariffs impact Broadcom’s business due to its relationship with Apple?Recent Tariff Changes Provide a Reprieve for Apple and BroadcomMarkets were highly concerned about Apple after the tariff back-and-forth between the United States and China. Apple has Chinese companies assemble around 90% of its iPhones. President Trump's  145% reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports would force Apple to raise iPhone prices, which could greatly hurt sales volume. This would have been bad news for Broadcom, as fewer iPhone sales mean fewer chip sales.It looks like Apple and Broadcom can breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. The United States Customs and Border Protection recently announced that electronics will be exempt from these reciprocal tariffs. However, these companies are far from out of the woods. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on electronics are still coming.The government will do this using sector-specific duties on semiconductors. Lutnick stated that the government could enact these in one to two months.Overall, it's difficult to say anything concrete with tariff policies changing daily. However, for Broadcom, these tariffs that could soon affect Apple products are destructive. They will hurt the firm’s non-AI chip business, possibly in a big way. It is important to note that Broadcom’s wireless business really wasn’t growing much anyway. Growth in this segment has ranged from slightly positive to slightly negative over many of the past quarters. Despite this, Broadcom has continued to succeed, indicating the company may not be massively hurt by lower Apple device demand.Broadcom and Apple's AI Ambitions and Potential Partnership [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:AVGO] In early December 2024, reports emerged that Apple was working with Broadcom to build its own AI chip. Apple wants to use the product in AI servers to enhance the capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Although Apple and Broadcom have not verified this relationship, some clues suggest that this could be true. Apple’s $500 billion investment in the United States will go largely toward making AI servers.Within this announcement, Apple said the servers will use “Apple silicon,"" indicating that Apple is designing custom chips. Tech firms like Alphabet have previously found a key partner in Broadcom in designing custom chips. Thus, it seems very possible that Apple and Broadcom are pairing up on this venture to do the same.This could significantly boost Broadcom’s revenues. Apple is the world’s most valuable public company, but many have seen the firm as a laggard when it comes to adopting AI. Broadcom would be happy to help them catch up.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:a77b9b2a9094b:0-broadcom-s-apple-relationship-ai-opportunity-meets-tariff-risk/
Top U.S. Firms May Set the Course for Productivity,1746715260000,"By Matt GrossmanNew analysis suggests that cutting-edge tech giants and other standout companies have pushed the economy forward more than previously understood.In a new paper, researchers at McKinsey found that a relatively small handful of top businesses have done far more to accelerate workplace productivity than the vast sea of their competitors.Productivity measures how much workers accomplish, on average, during a standard shift: an important variable in determining whether the economy can thrive and grow without generating inflation.Many economists have figured that America's solid productivity improvements in the past decade grew out of a massive agglomeration of tiny tweaks at millions of businesses. In fact, what happens inside some of the U.S.'s megacaps likely weighs quite a bit heavier, according to McKinsey.Researchers at the consulting firm's internal research arm studied how much each of a set of more than 8,000 firms in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany added to the overall group's productivity between 2011 and 2019. They found in a report published Wednesday that in the U.S., just 5% of companies contributed 78% of the productivity growth that the entire U.S. group achieved over those eight years.As might be expected, tech giants including Amazon.com, Nvidia and Broadcom were prominent among the outperformers. In other industries, superstar retailers such as Home Depot have moved the ball forward, as have, perhaps more surprisingly, big air carriers such as United Airlines, McKinsey thinks.By the research team's thinking, each of these productivity superstars harnessed breakaway capabilities to transform the way its workers get things done. Home Depot's logistics, pricing and IT infrastructure, for example, have allowed its retail workers to produce far more value on the job than cashiers at mom-and-pop hardware stores ever could.That's not to say broader factors don't also play a part. The American culture of enterprise and the U.S.'s relatively permissive rules for businesses foster an environment that makes those innovations possible, said Olivia White, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, which produced the report.""It's very much going to be the fruit of both the regulatory environment in the country and also the ecosystem among the companies,"" White said. ""The way the whole system works really, really matters.""Data published Thursday by the Labor Department showed that productivity fell by 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, after rising by 1.7% in 2024's fourth quarter. It was the first quarterly decline in productivity in almost three years.Because explaining productivity is so subtle, many economists don't pay that much attention to changes from quarter to quarter. Over 2023 and 2024, U.S. productivity growth averaged about 2.6% per year, well above other big economies' track record.During those years, American productivity outperformance fueled a remarkable stretch of resilient growth coupled with falling inflation, a pairing that lifted the U.S. as a magnet for global investment. Yet there's been no deep consensus among economists on what set the U.S. apart.Competing explanations have included an intensive shortage of workers that hit during the postpandemic boom, which forced companies to deploy limited staff more productively. Others have argued that a large cohort of newly created businesses gave rise to thousands of new sandboxes where bosses could rethink how work gets done.McKinsey's research casts some doubt on those ideas. During the 2010s at least, McKinsey's new work suggests, U.S. productivity growth had a lot more to do with seismic changes that originated from a small posse of standouts.The firm also cites bold moves such as how Broadcom shifted its strategy to focus on infrastructure software, rather than just semiconductors, as turning points in the U.S. productivity story. Similarly, workers who played a part in Apple's smartphone business were helping to develop a genuinely life-changing and remarkably profitable product.Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250508010576:0-top-u-s-firms-may-set-the-course-for-productivity/

Nvidia Stock Leaps on Report Trump Will Relax AI Chip Export Curbs — Barrons.com,1746648660000,"Adam Clark and Liz MoyerNvidia stock jumped late in Wednesday's trading session after a report the Trump administration could relax export curbs on artificial intelligence chips.Shares of Nvidia closed up 3.1%. Other chip stocks also rallied after a Bloomberg report said President Donald Trump would overturn AI chip export curbs put into place by the Biden administration that were set to go into effect.Earnings from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer indicated healthy demand for artificial-intelligence chips, but they also highlighted risks from export restrictions and the transition to new infrastructure.Positive signs came from rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, which reported better-than-expected earnings, and gave sales guidance ahead of expectations in a report on Tuesday. Shares of AMD rose 1.8% on Wednesday.AMD warned that U.S. export controls on semiconductors would cost the company $1.5 billion in revenue this year, in a reminder of the threat hanging over the chip industry.Nvidia has already disclosed that its first-quarter results will include a $5.5 billion charge associated with inventory and purchase commitments related to the H20 chip for the Chinese market, following the imposition of licensing requirements.

"Advanced Micro Devices 'Remarkably' Guides Q2 Revenue Above Street Despite Export Headwinds, Morgan Stanley Says",1746637679000,"Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ:AMD pulled off a difficult feat Tuesday, reporting better-than-expected financial results for Q1 and ""remarkably"" raising its Q2 revenue forecast above Wall Street estimates, analysts at Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday in a research note. The chipmaker's improved Q2 outlook, climbing to a range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion, was maybe its most impressive accomplishment given the likely impact of export controls on China, the analysts said. Overall, the company is now expecting the restrictions on Chinese semiconductor sales to reduce revenue by around $1.5 billion this year, including a $700 million hit during the current quarter and the rest largely occurring during Q3, they said. ""That's a slightly smaller headwind that we had expected, but (still) in the ballpark,"" the analysts said. Based on the new guidance, Morgan Stanley is now expecting Advanced Micro to earn $0.54 per share in Q2, excluding one-time items, on around $7.41 billion in revenue. For 2025, the firm is projecting non-GAAP net income of $4.20 per share, down from $4.53 per share previously, and $32.41 billion in revenue, up from $31.48 billion. The Morgan Stanley analysts also lowered their price target for Advanced Micro shares to $121 from $137 while reiterating their equal-weight stock rating, citing macro-economic factors and a slightly more speculative position relative to rival chipmakers Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Broadcom NASDAQ:AVGO , especially with its artificial intelligence offerings.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250507:A3372387:0/

Marvell Stock Falls Sharply. What's Hurting the Former AI Chip Favorite. — Barrons.com,1746627960000,"By Adam ClarkMarvell Technology was falling sharply Wednesday after the company postponed its investor day in the face of market uncertainty.It's another blow for a stock which has lost its status as a favored play on the artificial-intelligence trend.The designer of data-storage and networking chips said it had decided to postpone its previously scheduled investor-day event from June 10 to an unspecified future date in 2026, citing ""the dynamic macroeconomic environment,"" in a statement late on Tuesday.At the same time, Marvell reaffirmed the midpoint of first-quarter revenue guidance and narrowed its range. It expects revenue of about $1.875 billion, with a range of plus or minus 2%.The stock was down 8.9% at $55.75 on Wednesday. That's set to add to a 45% drop this year so far through Tuesday's close, which has wiped out all of Marvell's gains from 2024.Marvell became a market darling last year alongside peer Broadcom as investors bet that its clients — which analysts believe include Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft — would spend heavily on the company's custom chip designs as they sought alternatives to Nvidia hardware.However, poorly received guidance alongside quarterly earnings in March sunk the stock as investors soured on AI plays amid tariff uncertainty. Marvell has also been hit by concerns that it might lose out on designing the next generation of Amazon's custom Trainium AI chips.""The postponed investor day will only add to the wall of worry that has developed around the name, particularly around Marvell's ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] opportunity following reports that Taiwanese competitor Alchip has won Amazon's next-generation Trainium 3 project,"" wrote William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji in a research note.Marvell did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.However Naji still sees opportunity in the shares, reiterating an Outperform rating on Marvell stock. He noted the company now trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of just 21 times his forecast for its 2025 earnings and 18 times its forecast 2026 earnings — a far cry from the forward earnings multiple of more than 40 times it carried late last year.""While at these levels the stock is not expensive, we worry that the shares may be range-bound until investor confidence in Marvell's custom chip pipeline improves,"" Naji wrote.Investors might hope for some reassurance at a June 17 webinar focused on the future of custom silicon technology for AI infrastructure, which Marvell said it would hold.""While we are encouraged that the company still plans to address its custom silicon opportunity, where the firm noted 'great progress,' we also read into the indefinite rescheduling of its investor day as a likely negative indicator for the firm's near-term upcoming July quarter outlook,"" wrote Benchmark Research analyst Cody Acree in a research note.Acree lowered his estimates for Marvell's revenue for its fiscal 2026 year — ending Jan. 31 2026 — to $8.11 billion from $8.19 billion previously and his full-year earnings per share forecast to $2.74 from $2.80.The Benchmark analyst lowered his target price to $95 from $135.

Tapping into industries like travel, hospitality, and technology bodes well for the company. Affirm Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 37.1% and 96.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 60% in the last 60 days. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 36.2% from the last closing price of $51. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $50 to $86. This indicates a maximum upside of 68.6% and a downside of 2%. Broadcom Inc.Broadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs) as witnessed in first-quarter fiscal 2025. Strong demand for AVGO’s application-specific integrated chips, designed to support AI and machine learning, aids top-line growth. AVGO expects second-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 44% year over year to $4.4 billion. The acquisition of VMware has benefited Infrastructure software solutions. As of fiscal first quarter, roughly 70% of Broadcom’s largest 10,000 customers have adopted VMware Cloud Foundation. AVGO’s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential.AVGO’s XPUs are necessary to train Generative AI models, and they require complex integration of compute, memory, and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. AVGO’s next-generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. Broadcom remains on track for volume shipment of these XPUs to its hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. AVGO sees massive opportunities in the AI space as specific hyperscalers have started to develop their own XPUs. Broadcom believes that by 2027 each of its three hyperscalers would deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. Serviceable Addressable Market for XPUs and network are expected to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone.Broadcom has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 21% and 35.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending October 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% in the last 60 days.The short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 20.4% from the last closing price of $200.09.

This indicates a maximum upside of 50% and no downside. Expand Energy Corp.Expand Energy has emerged as the largest U.S. natural gas producer after its merger with Chesapeake and Southwestern. With key assets in the Haynesville and Marcellus basins, EXE is well-positioned to capitalize on rising demand from LNG exports, AI/data centers, and electrification. EXE plans to ramp up production to 7,100 MMcfe/day in 2025, through a $2.7 billion investment plan. EXE’s LNG exposure reduces price volatility, while efficiency gains are expected to unlock $500 million in cost savings by 2026. Strong financials, a $2.30 per share dividend, and a focus on deleveraging add stability. While natural gas price volatility and integration risks remain, EXE’s scale, cost efficiencies, and LNG positioning provide long-term upside.Expand Energy has expected revenue and earnings growth rate of more than 100% each, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.6% in the last 30 days.The short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 13.2% from the last closing price of $108.51.

Pre-Markets Open in The Red ,1744815240000,"Economic & Earnings CommentaryPre-market futures are still in the red at this hour, but threaten to break out into positive territory compared with where we were overnight. We’re also bifurcated presently: -40 points, roughly, on both the Dow and S&P 500, but -260 points on he tech-heavy Nasdaq.A report that NVIDIA NVDA will take a $5.5 charge on its H20 AI chips that were believed to be headed to China. The ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China has snuffed this out — news reports refer to this as being “curbed” — and sent NVIDIA shares down -6% in pre-market trading. AMD AMD is doing even worse, Broadcom AVGO a bit better — but still all down.Retail Sales Improve for March: Evidence of “Pull-Forward”?We remain at the mercy of trade tariff policy for the foreseeable future, and this goes for plenty of economic reports for last month, as well. To wit, U.S. Retail Sales for March reached +1.4% on headline, 20 basis points (bps) ahead of expectations. Ex-autos, +0.5% is a strong showing, even if it is still -20 bps below the big upward revision to February’s number.Ex-autos and gas swung up to +0.8% last month, equalling the upward revision for the previous month (which itself was ratcheted up 30 bps) and the strongest month since September 2024’s +1.2%. The Control number, which feeds other economic data like PCE (which comes out at the end of this month), was a bit weaker, relatively: +0.4%, from the upwardly revised +1.3% for February.At a glance, these figures all seem to be U.S. companies getting ahead of the tariffs, which began two weeks ago today, April 2nd. Remain unconvinced? Check auto parts deliveries last month, which rose +5.3%. This resembles more a year-over-year number than a month-over-month one. Perhaps we’ll need to compare these figures to the coming months, but it stands to reason we see a “pull-forward” in this data.Q1 Earnings Roundup: TRV, ABT, USB & MoreQ1 earnings season continues to heat up. Major insurance provider and Dow component The Travelers TRV posted a strong beat in its Q1 earnings ahead of the opening bell: $1.91 per share was nearly +200% stronger than the 64 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $11.87 billion, however, came in -2.17% from estimates. Shares are up +2.5% on the news, adding to the stock’s +3.6% year to date.Abbott Laboratories ABT beat on its Q1 earnings by 2 cents to $1.09 per share, while missing slightly on its top line: $10.36 billion versus $10.42 billion expected. Better performance in its Pharma and Nutrition space were offset somewhat by lower numbers from its Diagnostics segment. Shares are down marginally, but still up more than +10% year to date.U.S. Bank USB keeps the train of big banks reporting earnings this week, notching slight beats on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $1.03 per share on $6.96 billion in revenues outpaced expectations by +4% and +0.6%, respectively. Shares are up +1.4% in today’s pre-market, but still have a long climb back from -17% year to date.Swedish auto parts provider Autoliv ALV posted strong beats for both earnings and revenues in its Q1 report this morning, beating on earnings per share by +25% and +4.25% on quarterly sales. Again, we sense some “beat the tariffs” trading going on with these figures, but shares are up +8% ahead of the regular session, making up a good chunk of its -12% level year to date.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a4890eef9094b:0-pre-markets-open-in-the-red/
Broadcom Stock Gets a Lift on Hyperscaler Earnings & CapEx Boost,1746618300000,"Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ:AVGO continues to be a central player in the AI infrastructure build-out, and recent developments across the tech landscape may strengthen its growth outlook. Despite lingering market concerns about the pace and durability of AI-related spending, recent earnings season delivered a series of encouraging signals. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO] Several major technology firms reported strong momentum in their AI businesses, along with plans to maintain or increase capital expenditures tied to AI infrastructure.These announcements matter for Broadcom. As a supplier of high-performance networking components and custom silicon that help power large-scale AI deployments, Broadcom’s fortunes are tightly linked to the investment cycles of its largest customers.And while questions around competitive pressures and spending slowdowns have weighed on sentiment in recent months, investor response suggests a shift in tone: since the first of these earnings reports was released on April 24, Broadcom shares have climbed 7% through the May 6 close .The rebound reflects growing confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track—and that Broadcom remains well-positioned to benefit.AI Strength at Google & Meta Signal AI Strength for BroadcomTwo companies known as hyperscale customers of Broadcom are Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOGL , Google's parent company, and Meta Platforms NASDAQ:META . Both companies posted strong results, largely due to the AI-centric parts of their business. Alphabet’s Google Cloud segment saw strong revenue growth of 28%. AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions were key drivers of this increase. The company also confirmed its CapEx spending forecast . It plans to allocate $75 billion , much of which will go to AI infrastructure through calendar 2025. The company also said that, like Q4 2024, Cloud demand exceeded capacity this quarter, another sign that CapEx spending isn’t tailing off.Meta also posted better-than-expected results . Its revenue grew at a solid 16% clip, and the price paid per ad increased by 10%. This indicates that the value of advertising on Meta’s apps continues to increase, likely driven by the AI investment the company is making. Meta also provided several examples showing that its AI investments are driving more engagement in its apps. Adding to the optimism around the AI story is the fact that the company actually increased its CapEx guidance for 2025 by 9%. The firm now expects to spend $68 billion at the midpoint.Both of these results are good signs for Broadcom . They show that these AI hyperscale customers are seeing their investment in the technology lead to tangible results. Amid concerns that AI spending could slow down due to the DeepSeek revelations, these companies are in no way signaling that this is actually the case. This is key for Broadcom , considering that big reductions in AI infrastructure spending would be very bad news for the stock. The fact that Broadcom shares sold off over 17% in just one day after the DeepSeek news broke evidences this. [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:AVGO] Microsoft’s CapEx to Keep Growing: Could It Be Broadcom’s Next Customer?Microsoft’s NASDAQ:MSFT results also boost Broadcom's confidence , but in a somewhat different way. Microsoft reported a 33% increase in revenue from its Azure cloud business. AI is becoming a larger part of Azure’s growth. Three quarters ago, AI accounted for less than a quarter of the growth in Azure. That percentage has risen every quarter since. In the latest results,  almost half of Azure's growth came from AI . [content-module:MarketRank|NASDAQ:AVGO] Additionally, Microsoft reaffirmed its CapEx spending through the fiscal year ending in June at $80 billion. For the company’s next fiscal year, it has yet to release exact CapEx forecasts . However, the figure will be more than $80 billion. On the earnings call, the company said that compared to fiscal 2025 levels, “ we expect CapEx to grow. ” However, it did mention that the growth rate in CapEx would slow.Microsoft isn't a confirmed customer of Broadcom's AI chips. Still, rising AI demand and growth CapEx support Broadcom's investment case . It shows that investments in AI, which are a huge driver of revenue growth for Broadcom , are paying off. This means that hyperscalers are likely to keep spending on AI, providing a robust source of revenue for Broadcom. Aside from its current hyperscale customers, Broadcom is also in talks to develop custom AI chips for four other hyperscalers. At some point, news could break that Microsoft is one of these firms.Amazon Adds to Optimism, Broadcom’s AI Demand Can Keep HummingFurther good news came from another hyperscaler, Amazon.com NASDAQ:AMZN . The company noted its AI business is growing at triple digits from the previous year and referenced that demand still exceeds capacity.The company didn’t change its CapEx guidance from $100 billion for calendar 2025. Amazon is not a Broadcom customer, but the reasons for optimism are similar to those related to Microsoft.The AI-related news coming from these hyperscalers provides strong reassurance about Broadcom's growth story . Seeing the AI train continue to chug along for some time is key to the success of Broadcom's stock. Looking forward, it appears the engine will continue to see more coal shoveled into its firebox.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",https://www.tradingview.com/news/marketbeat:79fc3da9d094b:0-broadcom-stock-gets-a-lift-on-hyperscaler-earnings-capex-boost/

TSM Stock Soars 20% in a Month: Time to Hold or Book Profits?,1746558000000,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM has seen its share price soar 19.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 16.2% during the same period.This outperformance raises the question: Should investors book profits and exit, or continue holding the stock?What Drove TSM Stock Higher?Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s recent rally stemmed from broader market optimism. Whispers of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations significantly boosted market sentiment in late April. Protracted trade tensions had previously dampened global economic forecasts and corporate earnings expectations due to tariffs and retaliatory measures.Hints of a potential deal suggested easing tensions, possible tariff reductions and smoother international trade flows. This improved outlook fostered investor confidence, leading to a rally in the equity market as fears of further economic disruption subsided and prospects for global growth seemed brighter.Semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Broadcom, Inc. AVGO, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, were the prime gainers from this rally as they had witnessed a tremendous selloff previously following the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. Over the past month, shares of Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA soared 30.5%, 21.2% and 16.3%, respectively.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s long-term growth potential, along with invigorated investor optimism, makes the stock worth holding at the moment.AI Boom Boosts TSM’s ProspectsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continues to dominate the semiconductor foundry space with its technological superiority and production scale. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has placed Taiwan Semiconductor at the center of a multi-year structural growth cycle.The company has established itself as the preferred manufacturing partner for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom silicon developed by major players like NVIDIA, Marvell Technology and Broadcom.In 2024, AI-related revenues tripled, making up a mid-teen percentage of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s total revenues, and the momentum is far from over. The company expects AI-related sales to double again in 2025, with an impressive 40% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. This positions TSM as the undisputed backbone of AI-driven technological advancements.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has started 2025 on a strong note by reporting overwhelming first-quarter results, wherein revenues surged 35% year over year to $25.53 billion, while net income jumped 53% to nearly $11 billion. This growth was driven by explosive demand for its 3nm and 5nm nodes, which together contributed nearly 58% of total wafer revenues.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s first-quarter EPS also jumped 53.6% to $2.12 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03. The stock beat the consensus mark for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. QuoteTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is not only growing but also scaling at an unprecedented pace to capitalize on the AI-driven growing demand for advanced chips. The company is set to invest between $38 billion and $42 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, far outpacing its $29.8 billion investment in 2024. The bulk of this spending, around 70%, is focused on advanced manufacturing processes, ensuring TSM stays ahead of the curve.TSM Stock Trades at Attractive ValuationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.51, below the sector average of 23.84. This reasonable valuation, coupled with the company’s growth potential, offers an appealing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing also trades at a lower P/E ratio than other semiconductor players, including Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA. At present, Broadcom, Marvell Technology and NVIDIA trade at P/E ratios of 27.74, 20.95 and 24.8, respectively.Near-Term Risks Persist for TSMDespite its strengths, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing faces near-term headwinds. Higher energy prices in Taiwan, following a 25% electricity hike in 2024, pose a considerable challenge, especially as advanced nodes demand greater power.Softness in key markets like PCs and smartphones also dampens near-term prospects. These traditionally strong revenue drivers are projected to see only low single-digit growth in 2025, limiting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s growth despite rising AI demand.Additionally, rising operational costs, especially from its overseas expansion into Arizona, Japan and Germany, are other concerns. These new facilities, while strategically important for diversification, are expected to dilute gross margins by 2-3% annually over the next three to five years due to higher labor and utility costs, coupled with lower initial utilization rates.Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, further cloud the outlook. With significant revenue exposure to China, export restrictions and supply-chain disruptions could pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s operations.Conclusion: Hold TSM Stock for NowTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s technological leadership and strategic investments make it a compelling long-term player in the semiconductor space. However, short-term challenges, including rising costs, tariff wars and geopolitical risks, warrant caution. For now, holding TSM stock remains the most prudent strategy, allowing investors to benefit from its industry leadership while navigating near-term uncertainties.Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
