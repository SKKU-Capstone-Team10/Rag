Tech Stocks Had a Crazy Few Days. Another Big Week Is Ahead. — Barrons.com,1748156400000,"By Angela PalumboThe long weekend is a welcome reprieve for tech investors as they get ready for what's sure to be another busy few days.Wall Street is coming off a volatile week of trading. As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI ""to create all sorts of wonderful things."" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Apple has been the worst Big Tech stock lately. Here's why investors are missing the big picture.,1748089800000,"By Laila MaidanApple's stock has sold off on tariff fears, but the company has a healthy business underpinned by a sticky ecosystem and robust array of services offeringsOne thing Apple users can agree on is that it's hard to imagine trading an iPhone or a MacBook for a Samsung smartphone or a Lenovo laptop. That's probably the biggest thing Apple has going for it amid the tariff noise.Yet Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) has been under pressure lately. As large technology stocks have roared back in May, Apple shares have missed out. The stock is down 8% so far this month. It's the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that's in the red over that period, according to FactSet data. It's also the worst-performing stock of the bunch on a year-to-date basis, down 22%.Friday's tariff-related scare added to the pain. Apple's stock closed 3% lower to clinch its eighth loss in a row.Don't miss: Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.But even as President Donald Trump threatened Apple on Friday with a 25% tariff if it didn't bring its manufacturing into the U.S., analysts aren't flinching and don't think investors should either. But that point comes with a caveat that's like a pilot telling passengers they're about to experience some turbulence. That's true, too, of Apple's stock. The short-term ride might be unpleasant, but arrival is still on time. So, if you're already invested, it's probably not a good idea to get off midflight.That said, over a three- to five-year timeframe, there's a lot of reason to be confident in the company's growth prospects because the products are part of an admirably sticky ecosystem, according to Gil Luria, the head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. His view is that the services tacked on to Apple's hardware products will keep customers coming back. It's also true that many who buy one Apple product, like an iPhone, tend to buy another, like a MacBook, Luria noted. In short, the recent stock weakness isn't a statement on the health of the business. It's more of a relationship issue between Trump and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.""If you get to a point where the president is posting in such a confrontational manner, that means the negotiation isn't going well,"" said Luria.It's a setback, but it's not bad enough to send Luria back to his model to rework his outlook for the company. While an additional 25% tariff would hurt the company's profitability, he believes there's still a chance that negotiations between Apple and the White House could stave off the worst. If Apple products did take an additional 25% tariff hit, that would hurt earnings in the nearer term. However, the costs could be spread out by partially raising prices and passing some costs along to parts suppliers, Luria said. Additionally, Apple wouldn't be at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as Trump noted that Samsung (KR:005930) and other makers of smartphones would also be slapped with 25% tariffs on devices made overseas as they're imported to the U.S.Ask the Moneyist: Is now a good time to buy an iPhone?Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, chuckled and called the tariff threat ""noise,"" adding that it doesn't impact how he views Apple. ""I don't think you can take too much away from these headlines,"" he said. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that Cook's relationship with the president isn't as strong as it may once have been, he noted. Under the first Trump administration, Cook was able to secure a tariff exemption.Valuationwise, Apple's stock is trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, below its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. But Apple could see the slowest sales growth among the group, with a two-year estimated compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.1% through 2026. What that all means, said Luria, is that, despite slowed sales, investors still have a lot of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Apple's stock trades at a premium compared with the S&P 500 SPX, which has a forward P/E of 21.2 and a two-year estimated sales CAGR slightly above Apple's at 5.6%. Meanwhile, Apple's forward P/E is slightly below that for the S&P 500 information-technology sector, which stands at 26.8. Yet the IT sector has a two-year sales CAGR more than double Apple's, at 11.3%.Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, says Apple's bigger problem is that Siri's integration with Apple Intelligence has fallen behand. The company is at risk of losing market share to any contender able to release life-changing generative AI services. That's something Mortonson believes could happen through Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pixel phones or through Google's partnership with Samsung Galaxy and the integration of generative AI into that smartphone.That risk means he wouldn't suggest investors be overweight the stock, and he believes a stock like Alphabet is a better bet given its cheaper forward P/E at 17.3 with a two-year estimated sales CAGR double Apple's, at 10.7%.The next important event for Apple will be its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 9. The company will have a chance to wow customers with any updates, particularly on Apple Intelligence. But until then, Luria believes, he said, that investors should suspend judgment about the stock.Overall, investing is based on an individual's risk tolerance. While Apple is still seen as a solid company, and a good stock to own, there may be better risk-reward opportunities elsewhere. As for investors who already own the stock because they like the company and believe in the business's long-term prospects, panic selling based on negative headlines is never a good strategy. Instead, investors should focus on the company's key drivers. And a big one right now is how well Apple can compete in generative AI services because that will help drive hardware sales and increase demand for Apple's services segment, including cloud storage.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"“No chance” iPhones can be made in the US, analysts say — options Apple could explore instead to tackle tariffs",1748073600000,"Apple is staring down a major supply chain and pricing dilemma after President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the United States unless the tech giant begins manufacturing the devices domestically. Trump’s remarks, posted on Truth Social and reiterated later to reporters at the White House, are the latest escalation in his push for US-based production by large multinationals.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote, warning that otherwise “a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.”The president’s comments come as Apple has been ramping up production in India, seeking to diversify away from its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing amid rising geopolitical tensions and pandemic-era disruptions. CEO Tim Cook recently said more iPhones sold in the US would be made in India, a shift that may now be politically fraught.Analysts say iPhone making in the US unfeasible; say threat a negotiation tacticApple shares dropped almost 3% on Friday trading following Trump’s post, falling to $195.44. The prospect of steep tariffs raised concerns across financial markets, with analysts warning of significant cost implications and logistical hurdles should Apple try to comply.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimated that manufacturing iPhones in the US could push retail prices to $3,500, a dramatic increase from today’s average $1,000. “We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,” Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Morningstar analyst William Kerwin echoed those sentiments, describing domestic iPhone manufacturing as unfeasible in the medium term. “To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater US investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone,” he said.Potential strategies for Apple under tariff threatFaced with this new pressure, Apple may explore various strategies to blunt the impact of a potential tariff hike.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring suggested that Apple could cut less profitable models from its iPhone lineup, focusing instead on higher-margin units to reduce the blow. A “targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,” Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.Another option floated by analysts involves stretching the product release cycle. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple could switch from an annual to a biennial launch schedule, simplifying supply chains and production timelines.Apple may also decide to confront the administration directly, publicly tying higher prices to Trump’s trade stance. One proposal discussed in analyst circles is for Apple to add a “tariff surcharge” to each US sales receipt, making consumers aware of how much more they’re paying because of the new tariffs.Constraints that limit Apple’s US productionFor now, most analysts agree that relocating iPhone production to the US is impractical. Apple’s manufacturing relies heavily on China-based partner Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers and taps into a dense web of suppliers, logistics firms, and engineers—none of which are easily replicable in the US.“The idea of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said, adding that even if the company decided to pursue the move, it would take five to ten years to make it a reality.The challenges are not new. In 2011, when President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the US, Jobs reportedly replied, “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” referring to Asia’s unmatched industrial infrastructure and labour scale.Some of Apple’s suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, are expanding US operations under pressure. However, Foxconn appears unlikely to significantly boost its American footprint. The firm scaled back a highly publicized $10 billion Wisconsin plant and has instead committed $1.49 billion to its India operations.Likely bearing of 25% tariff on Apple’s earningsUBS analyst David Vogt estimated that if a 25% tariff were applied to 70 million iPhones annually imported from China and India, Apple’s earnings per share could take a hit of about $0.51. Wall Street currently expects Apple to earn $7.18 per share this fiscal year.As pressure mounts from Washington, Apple is left navigating a volatile mix of political demands, economic realities, and consumer expectations. Whether Trump’s threat is a hard policy shift or a negotiation tactic, it has already forced a reckoning over the limits of globalization and the fragility of tech supply chains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:669d8abeb094b:0-no-chance-iphones-can-be-made-in-the-us-analysts-say-options-apple-could-explore-instead-to-tackle-tariffs/
Tim Cook's Bad Year Keeps Getting Worse — WSJ,1748052000000,"By Rolfe WinklerFor Tim Cook, the hits keep coming.On Friday, President Trump targeted Apple with new demands that the company make iPhones in the U.S., threatening 25% tariffs if the company doesn't comply. ""Rise and shine Tim Cook,"" Trump whisperer Laura Loomer posted on X, reminding the Apple CEO he is at the center of the president's trade bull's-eye.That is just one of the threats Cook has confronted in what has appeared to be a no good, very bad year for Apple. Aside from Trump, Cook is facing off against two U.S. judges, European and worldwide regulators, state and federal lawmakers, and even a creator of the iPhone, to say nothing of the cast of rivals outrunning Apple in artificial intelligence.Each is a threat to Apple's hefty profit margins, long the company's trademark and the reason investors drove its valuation above $3 trillion before any other company. Shareholders are still Cook's most important constituency. The stock's 25% fall from its peak shows their concern about whether he — or anyone — can navigate the choppy 2025 waters.What can be said for Apple is that the company is patient, and that has often paid off in the past.This past week, a key architect of the iPhone, Jony Ive, joined OpenAI to develop a next-generation device that weans consumers off screens. After he announced a deal to sell his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported that a key goal is to deliver an AI-powered device that shifts the current computing paradigm in which humans stare at black rectangles all day. Later, OpenAI told employees it is aiming to make 100 million AI ""companion"" devices.It is hard to gauge the potential for a brand-new computing device from a company that has never made one. Yet the fact that it is coming from the man who led design of the iPhone and other hit Apple products means it can't be dismissed. Apple sees the threat coming: ""You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as that sounds,"" an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified in a court case this month.Apple isn't expected to show any AI breakthroughs at its annual developer conference in a couple of weeks. And Cook said on Apple's recent earnings call that a more personalized Siri assistant hasn't arrived yet because what the company has in the shop doesn't yet meet Apple's ""high quality bar.""The company might not need to be first in AI. It didn't make the first music player, smartphone or tablet. It waited, and then conquered each market with the best. A question is whether a strategy that has been successful in devices will work for AI.Apple makes billions in revenue from its services business, carrying gross profit margins north of 70%, compared with less than 40% for hardware. A judge wrote in a recent ruling that Apple ignored her injunction to allow app developers to bypass its steep fees on app store purchases. ""Cook chose poorly"" in listening to advice to ignore her, she wrote. European Union regulators want Apple to make similar changes abroad, and worldwide regulators could follow suit.State and federal lawmakers are threatening the app store with legislation to require Apple to verify user ages. While the bottom-line impact of such a move is unclear, it could reduce teen spending or even empower parents to limit teen engagement on smartphones more fully.Meanwhile, the judge overseeing an antitrust case against Alphabet's Google could demand that the search giant stop paying Apple some $20 billion annually to be the default search engine in Safari, revenue that is basically pure profit for Apple.Of course, all of these issues pale next to threats to Cook's greatest creation — Apple's supply chain in China.Trump's demands notwithstanding, there isn't much Apple can do to move iPhone production, which remains centered in China. While it is shifting final assembly of more iPhones to India, many of the components inside the device still come from across the Himalayas.The strategy gives Apple some flexibility to arbitrage different tariffs for U.S.-bound devices assembled in the two countries.Trump wants a made-in-America iPhone. Such a device could cost over $3,000, so he is unlikely to get one.Cook might try to placate him by shifting production of something else to the U.S., and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent may have given Cook an out on iPhones when he said Friday that the administration wants Apple to make more of its chips here.Apple already announced plans to facilitate production of AI servers in Texas, but Trump clearly expects more. With frequent calls to the White House and a meeting there in the past week, Cook, it seems, is negotiating his next peace offering.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009759:0/
How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/
Review — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Robert TeitelmanMarkets: On Monday, markets digested Moody's U.S. debt downgrade and the passage through a House committee of Republicans' tax and budget bill. Longer-dated Treasury yields climbed to 5% and the dollar fell. Stocks edged up slightly, then fell on Tuesday, ending a six-day win streak. A 20-year Treasury auction struggled on Wednesday.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/
Tim Cook Called Texas Governor to Stop Online Child-Safety Legislation — WSJ,1748036400000,"By Rolfe Winkler, Amrith Ramkumar and Meghan BobrowskyApple stepped up efforts in recent weeks to fight Texas legislation that would require the iPhone-maker to verify ages of device users, even drafting Chief Executive Tim Cook into the fight.The CEO called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week to ask for changes to the legislation or, failing that, for a veto, according to people familiar with the call. These people said that the conversation was cordial and that it made clear the extent of Apple's interest in stopping the bill.Abbott has yet to say whether he will sign it, though it passed the Texas legislature with veto-proof majorities.In the weeks leading up to its passage, Apple hired more lobbyists to pressure lawmakers. An interest group it funds targeted the Austin, Texas, area with ads saying the legislation is ""backed by porn websites."" Google also finances the interest group and is fighting the legislation. The law's supporters say adult-content sellers don't favor it.Texas would be the largest state to adopt what is called an app-store accountability law. Similar laws have been proposed across at least nine states and adopted in one, Utah. Federal legislation also has been introduced. Meta Platforms — along with social-media companies X and Snap — also have played a role in the lobbying fight, advocating that what is known as ""age-gating"" should be the responsibility of app stores rather than individual apps.The Texas bill is turning heads because its success in the second-biggest state with a Republican legislature could foreshadow adoption across the country, potentially creating new costs for Apple and Google, as well as for some app makers.The law requires those running app stores, primarily Apple and Google, to verify the age of a device owner. If the owner is a minor, their app-store account would have to be tied to a parent's account. The parent would be notified when their child wants to download an app and have to approve or deny the download.Proponents argue that such laws will give parents more control over their children's use of smartphones, and that children aren't legally allowed to agree to apps' terms of service in the first place.Critics say such a law could impose costs on a swath of apps whose content isn't controversial. They also say the bills are allowing Meta and other apps to shunt responsibility for online safety onto others.One reason the laws are being crafted to have app stores verify ages, and not individual apps that are viewed as problematic, is that the latter approach would likely be struck down on free speech grounds, say those who have helped shepherd the bills.Meta has 13 lobbyists working in Texas, according to the state's Ethics Commission. Apple has six and Google has seven.An Apple spokesman said that the company wants to strengthen online safety for children but that the Texas bill threatens user privacy. ""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" he said.Meta has said that verifying ages at the app store-level is easier and helps preserve privacy, by only having children's ages stored in one place instead of on every app they access.A spokesman for Abbott said ""safety and online privacy for Texas children remains a priority for Governor Abbott. The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk.""The age-verification bills are the latest threat to Apple's lucrative apps business. Last month, a judge forced the company to allow app developers to avoid Apple's steep commissions on app-store sales, a move the European Union is also pushing for.It is also the latest sign that Cook is playing a personal role lobbying for the company. When it comes to tariffs, he is known to call President Trump directly to advocate for the company's position. He was spotted visiting the White House on Tuesday. He also personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.Apple lobbyists successfully blocked a similar effort in Louisiana last spring, but that bill has returned this year and is advancing.Some states are moving ahead with app-store bills anyway.""The more we can help parents understand what their children are really interacting with and give them tools to help them make good parenting decisions, then I think we're all better off,"" said Angela Paxton, the Texas state senator who sponsored the legislation.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com, Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523005634:0/
"Trump Threatens Fresh Tariffs on EU, iPhones and Rival Devices — WSJ",1748034900000,"By Gavin Bade, Meridith McGraw and Rolfe WinklerWASHINGTON — President Trump fired new salvos in the global trade war on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on imported goods from the European Union and new duties on iPhones and other smartphones made overseas.Trump said the EU had been ""very difficult to deal with"" on trade in a Friday morning social-media post. Less than a half hour earlier, he threatened Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, with a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones made overseas.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" he wrote on Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.Later on Friday, in Oval Office comments, Trump said those tariffs will include ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair."" Trump appeared to be referring to companies that manufacture smartphones outside of the U.S. He added that the tariffs would likely be imposed in late June.The threats build on the president's effort to pressure CEOs to move more manufacturing to America and punish allies whose trade policies the White House argues are unfair. Cook met with Trump at the White House this week, according to a White House official.The White House didn't immediately provide additional comment. Apple declined to comment. An EU representative declined to comment. Apple shares declined 3% on Friday.Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU imports, which was later paused for 90 days to allow for negotiations. A 10% baseline levy remains, and some specific EU products, like cars, are subject to higher tariff rates.The U.S. president has long criticized European nations on trade, and he said in his Friday morning social-media post that trade discussions with the bloc had made little progress. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!"" he wrote. He said the 50% tariff would go into effect on June. 1.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he is ""not looking for a deal."" Minutes later, he said the EU likely wants an agreement to avoid the tariffs, and added, ""We're going to see what happens, but right now it's going on on June 1."" Trump listed Europe's nontariff barriers, regulations and lawsuits against U.S. firms as prime irritants driving his threat.European officials had expressed cautious optimism in recent days that talks were progressing after the two sides exchanged documents outlining some of the trade issues they are seeking to discuss. However, they acknowledged they remain far apart in their positions.The EU has been unwilling to move on some of Trump's demands, particularly the value-added tax, which the administration views as an unfair trade practice, but EU Economy Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said the tax is off the table in negotiations. This week, Dombrovskis needled the Trump team at a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting by saying their trade deals would be a ""suboptimal"" outcome for the global economy and suggesting that U.S. allies had to compromise with the U.S. on trade language in a joint statement.EU Trade Commissioner Maroš efčovič spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, hours after Trump's initial threat. In a social-media post after the call, he said the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, but added that trade between the U.S. and EU ""must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.""""We stand ready to defend our interests,"" he added.During the meeting of finance ministers in Canada this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told EU officials they have a ""collective action problem,"" warning that progress on reaching a trade deal with Europe had slowed because each nation has different priorities for an agreement, according to a U.S. official.Bessent on Friday hit out at Europe again, saying on Fox News that ""with the exception of the EU, most [nations] are negotiating in good faith.""Last week, Trump chided Cook for Apple's plans to shift final assembly for many U.S.-bound devices to India, and he reiterated his demands that the company bring manufacturing back to America. He called the CEO his ""friend,"" but suggested that Apple's plan to invest some $500 billion in America wasn't enough.Bernard Arnault, CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, this week urged European lawmakers to take a more pragmatic, deal-focused approach to trade negotiations with the U.S.""The United States is the No. 1 market in the world,"" Arnault told French senators during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. ""It's very important for Europe to reach an agreement with the United States. As of now, it seems to me things are off to a bad start.""Arnault, who first met Trump when the two men were real-estate developers in New York in the 1980s, also warned against adopting a confrontational tone.""If we threaten him — if we say, for example, 'We're coming in and we're going to take this or that measure,' or, 'We no longer want our companies to invest in the United States' — we'll get the opposite result,"" Arnault said.After Trump raised tariffs on goods made in China, Apple accelerated its effort to make most U.S.-bound iPhones in India. Such a move would allow it to claim India as the ""country of origin"" and pay the lower duties facing that nation.Bessent, in his Friday interview with Fox, said the administration is trying to persuade Apple to build semiconductors in the U.S.""I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities...is this external production, especially in semiconductors. A large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors,"" Bessent said. ""We would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Bessent said he met with Cook this week.Technology experts have said that while shifting some iPhone manufacturing to America is possible, building the full stack of iPhone components and assembling it in the U.S. would be challenging and costly. IPhones contain a patchwork of sophisticated parts, sourced from many countries and put together primarily in China. America doesn't have facilities that resemble the infrastructure developed in China, nor does it have skilled manpower to assemble iPhones at that scale.Apple shares declined slightly more than the market, but not to an extent that indicates investor concern that the company would be subject to the 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones. ""The market is obviously concluding that this is just a negotiation,"" said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.He said he expects the eventual outcome for Apple will be for the company to make some additional components in the U.S., but not iPhones themselves.Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com, Meridith McGraw at Meridith.McGraw@WSJ.com and Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523004234:0/
Wall Street Declines After Trump's Fresh Tariff Threats; Apple Falls 3%,1748033993000,"US benchmark equity indexes declined on Friday as President Donald Trump's tariff threats against the European Union and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL refueled concerns about a trade war. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1% at 18,737.2. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% to 5,802.8, marking the fourth straight day of declines, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6% to 41,603.1. Among sectors, technology saw the biggest drop, while utilities paced the gainers. The three benchmarks are down more than 2% each this week. US markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Trump recommended a 50% tariff rate on the EU, effective June 1, saying that talks with the bloc had stalled. The announcement has ""reignited"" concerns about a transatlantic trade war, ING Bank said. Separately, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares declined 3%. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a client note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""""Today's announced threat may be a goad to European leaders to negotiate more quickly with the US,"" Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report. ""In any case, the news reiterates our cautious guidance of recent weeks, namely, that new tariffs (and, as today, threats of tariffs) remain material risks to financial markets, especially when the announcements come as surprises.""US Treasury yields were lower, with the 10-year rate decreasing 4.4 basis points to 4.51% and the two-year rate losing nearly one basis point to 3.99%. Deckers Outdoor NYSE:DECK shares sank 20%, the worst performer on the S&P 500. The footwear and apparel company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Despite being strong, the results were overshadowed by sales growth deceleration at its Hoka sneaker brand and potential demand weakness from price increases, KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a client note. KeyBanc lowered its rating on Deckers' stock to sector weight from overweight. Workday NASDAQ:WDAY shares slumped nearly 13% on Friday, the second biggest drop on the S&P 500. The cloud human resources company late Thursday logged better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and issued a subscription revenue outlook for the ongoing three-month period that matched Wall Street's estimates. Intuit NASDAQ:INTU was the best performer on the S&P 500, up 8.1%. The financial technology platform late Thursday posted fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded the Street's estimates. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 0.7% at $61.63 a barrel. For the week, WTI crude futures were expected to report a modest decline. There are rising expectations of a third straight output increase by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, Saxo Bank Head of Commodity Strategy Ole Hansen said in a report published Friday. In economic news, new home sales in the US unexpectedly rose in April despite an increase in median prices, government data showed.

"Stocks Fall on Tariff Broadside, After Week of Bond Market Agita — WSJ",1748032860000,"By Matt WirzThe markets started the week with fears of a deficit crisis and ended with renewed angst over tariffs.President Trump renewed his tariff campaign Friday, threatening to impose a 50% rate on the European Union and warning Apple that foreign-made iPhones could face significant levies. Shares of Apple lost 3%, while broader stock indexes finished the day lower by 0.6% to 1%. The S&P 500 index ended the week down 2.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite both fell 2.5%.""I'm not so worried about the stock action,"" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management. ""A 2% to 3% drop is just normal trading compared to what investors have gotten used to in the last couple of months.""More worrying is the steady rise in Treasury bond yields since Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. government and the House of Representatives passed a tax bill that could add to the country's large budget deficit.The 30-year Treasury bond yield finished the week at 5.036%, its highest level since 2023, while the 10-year yield ended the week at 4.508%, about the same as its high point during the worst of the market turmoil in April. Bond yields rise when prices fall. In contrast, the S&P 500 is still about 16% above its lowest point in April.Stock investors are relatively sanguine because ""they now know that Trump will pivot on trade,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, referring to the president's softer stance since late April. Stock prices would have dropped far more dramatically had Trump made his comments about Europe in March, he said. ""The market has finally figured out not to overreact to every salvo.""Still, the fresh tariff threats from the White House are aimed at core pillars of global commerce: one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. European stocks fell about 0.9% and investors sought shelter in haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, weighing on the dollar. Gold prices rallied.Senior U.S. and EU trade officials held a prearranged call on Friday, with neither side changing its position significantly in comments afterward. G-7 finance and central bank chiefs issued a vague statement Thursday that made no mention of levies, and only one mention of ""trade, "" after a summit that featured both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and EU representation.On Apple, Trump said in a Friday post that he has told Apple CEO Tim Cook ""that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.""Elevated Treasury bond yields indicate that traders are also worried that diminishing demand for U.S. government bonds will increase the country's borrowing costs. That would bring knock-on effects on large and small businesses by raising the cost of corporate loans and slowing economic activity.In another cause for concern, the value of the dollar is dropping even as bond-yields rise. That could indicate the U.S. currency is losing some of its appeal as a haven for foreign savers and corporations.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523008752:0/
Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Apple Is Unlikely to Escape Tariffs This Time. Trump Is Doubling Down. — Barrons.com,1748031480000,"By Adam Clark and Angela PalumboApple stock was dropping on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the U.S.""I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump said in a post on social-media platform Truth Social early on Friday.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.The president doubled down on his post in a meeting at the White House on Friday, where he told reporters that not only would he put tariffs on Apple if they don't move production to the U.S., but he would also place levies on Samsung and other smartphone products makers who import to the country to ensure fairness. He added that those tariffs would potentially start at the end of June.""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs,'"" Trump added.While tariffs are paid by the importer of record at the time the goods enter the country, economists generally agree that the increased costs are passed on to suppliers and consumers.In an interview with Fox News Friday morning, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he thinks one of the country's ""greatest vulnerabilities is this external production, especially in semiconductors, and a large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors, so we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Apple shares fell 3% to $195.27 on Friday. The stock has now fallen 22% this year, compared to the 1.3% decline of the S&P 500. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Owen Tedford, an analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, says the Apple tariff threats could be tied to the levies expected out of the administration's Section 232 investigations into certain sectors.""It would suggest that Trump is at least considering not giving the company an exemption from the duties,"" Tedford said. Apple was exempted from tariffs during Trump's first term in office. ""It also implies that there is at least some consideration to cover electronics devices as part of the [Section 232] tariffs that were expected to primarily hit semiconductors.""These sector-oriented tariffs are expected to be stickier but the timing still isn't still clear, especially as the administration tries to strike trade agreements with various countries related to its April 2 blitz of tariffs.As companies and countries await trade decisions from the president, Apple has already started making changes. It's increasing production of iPhones in India in a bid to diversify its production in response to the tariffs Trump has imposed on China, previously the main hub for the company's smartphone production. Trump has publicly criticized the move, saying he had ""a little problem"" with Apple CEO Cook and calling on the company to build in the U.S. instead.The Wall Street Journal reported that Cook met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, citing a White House official. Apple has already committed to investing more than $500 billion and hiring around 20,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years, although it unclear how much of that sum is new.The threatened 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured overseas is still likely to be considerably less than the cost of producing 'made in USA' devices. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has estimated that making an iPhone in the U.S. would probably lead to a retail price of around $3,500 compared with around $1,000 currently, and it would take years to build the necessary production capacity.""We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,"" Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Ives isn't alone in this belief. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin wrote in a research note on Friday that he doesn't think iPhone production in the U.S. is ""feasible in the medium term.""""To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater U.S. investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone.""Among other electronics like semiconductors and personal computers, Apple's products are temporarily exempt from the hefty reciprocal tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. However, Apple recently said it's already taking a financial hit from tariffs. CEO Tim Cook told analysts that shipping devices sold in the U.S. from India and Vietnam, rather than China, would add about $900 million to the company's costs for the June quarter in the company's earnings call earlier this month.Investors have been trying to figure out how much of an impact tariffs could have on Apple's top and bottom lines. UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a research note on Friday that ""if a 25% blanket tariff is applied to 70M annual iPhones imported into the U.S. from China and India, we estimate the annual EPS headwind would be $0.51."" Wall Street currently expects Apple to generate earnings of $7.18 in the current fiscal year.India is facing a potential 26% tariff on imports to the U.S., which has been suspended while trade talks take place, while levies on Chinese goods have been temporarily slashed to 30%.A few of Apple's key suppliers, such as chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, are expanding their U.S. operations under the threat of tariffs.However, its key manufacturing partner Foxconn — formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry — looks unlikely to follow suit, having already sharply scaled back plans for a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin which was announced in 2017. Foxconn said in a filing on Monday that it would invest $1.49 billion in its India unit.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tim Cook to Donald Trump: You Were Serious About That? — Barrons.com,1748030880000,"By Ben RoseAbout the author: Ben Rose is president of Battle Road Research, an independent equity-research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook's response to President Donald Trump's made-in-America push calls to mind a scene in the movie My Cousin Vinny. Vincent Gambini (played by Joe Pesci), a novice defense attorney, is scolded by Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) for showing up in his Alabama courtroom without a suit and tie, with the judge taking particular offense to Gambini's long leather jacket. When Gambini returns to the courtroom for his next appearance he is dressed the same way, but this time the judge holds in him contempt of court. Gambini, in disbelief, says to the judge: ""You were serious about that?""While Apple was entirely — some might say miraculously — spared from tariffs during Trump's first term, the president has vowed that now ""no one gets off the hook,"" not even America's most valuable company by market capitalization. And this time, he is serious. Apple will need to move some of its production to the U.S.During the first Trump administration, many U.S. companies that manufactured their products in China faced a 25% tariff. Some companies responded by moving production to other low-labor-cost countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to avoid the tariff penalty. Even though it had received an exemption, Apple, no doubt mindful of the growing tension between Washington and Beijing, began to move a portion of its iPhone production to India, in an effort to diversify its supply chain and manufacturing.At the start of the president's second term, companies were unsure whether the president's goal was to negotiate better trade deals, reduce reliance on China, or move more manufacturing back to the U.S. This time around, Apple wasn't going to take any chances. Just 35 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Apple unveiled plans to invest $500 billion (with a b) in the U.S. over the next four years to construct new manufacturing facilities, AI data centers, create 20,000 new jobs, and establish a manufacturing academy focused on workforce training.Having taken public steps to satisfy the president's wishes, Apple's executives likely breathed a further sigh of relief when U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on April 13 that computers and semiconductors would receive a 90-day reprieve from the president's scorching level of 145% tariffs on goods from China. Apple and others would be subject to a separate set of tariffs to be determined at a future date. Perhaps calculating that Trump's ultimate goal was simply to move manufacturing out of China, Apple announced a significant expansion of its production operations in India, presumably with the view that the president would not mind where its iPhones are made — so long as they are not made in China.But like Vincent Gambini, Tim Cook is learning the hard way that the president is serious about Apple making its products in the U. S. — ASAP — rather than potentially taking its sweet time by further expanding production in India.The pushback from Apple and others is that labor rates in the U.S. will make their products uncompetitive in the U.S., with some suggesting American-manufactured iPhones would cost U.S. consumers as much as $3,500.Apple is at least partially right, since labor costs in China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region are a fraction of what they would be in the U.S. In addition, Apple has invested billions of dollars in China, and has nurtured a reliable supply chain that meets its rigorous quality standards. Moving production to India or the U.S. is likely to result not only in higher costs, but a reduction in product quality. As a practical matter, not all of the components in Apple's products are made in America. So what is a practical solution to this standoff?Back to Vincent Gambini and Judge Haller. Following the judge's order, Gambini shells out the money to buy a brand new suit and tie, and thus satisfy the judge's edict to look ""lawyerly"" while defending his clients in the judge's courtroom. Apple's response might be to shell out the money to build or lease final assembly facilities in the U.S., while utilizing at least some amount of U.S.-based content, as well as contract manufacturers. It could also outsource prototyping, production, and bridge manufacturing to local companies that would welcome the work. In doing so, Apple would save a bundle on transportation costs from the Asia Pacific region, while at the same time demonstrate a good faith effort to more rapidly increase manufacturing and high tech jobs in the U.S. Otherwise, like Gambini and the judge, it will find out just how serious Trump was all along.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Trump's Tariff Threat Just Shattered the Bond Market -- Is Stagflation Back?,1748029511000,"The bond market just blinkedand it wasn't a small twitch.

Investors are bracing for the double whammy of sluggish growth and stubborn inflationexactly the type of environment that could tie the Fed's hands. The 30-year yield briefly fell to 4.97% before snapping back to 5.04%, yet it now sits a full percentage point above the 5-yeara gap we haven't seen this wide in more than three years. JPMorgan's NYSE:JPM Jamie Dimon echoed the anxiety earlier this week, warning that stagflation isn't off the table given the toxic mix of geopolitics, deficits, and price pressures.And here's the kicker: America's fiscal credibility is cracking. The House just greenlit a tax bill expected to balloon the deficit by $3.8 trillion. Moody's reacted by stripping the U.S. of its last AAA credit rating. Investors, spooked by future borrowing needs, are demanding more compensation to hold long-term debtthe 10-year term premium is now nearing 1%, a level last seen in 2014.

Apple (AAPL) Faces Trump Tariff Threat Over Overseas iPhone Production,1748029412000,"President Donald Trump on Friday warned Apple (AAPL, Financials) it must manufacture iPhones in the United States or face a 25% tariff on imports, escalating tensions over the company's production shift to India.Apple could see steep cost increases if forced to reshore production. Trump's comments followed recent meetings with CEO Tim Cook, where he objected to Apple's plans to manufacture U.S.-bound iPhones in India.Apple reported that roughly 90% of iPhones are still produced in China despite ongoing diversification efforts. The company warned investors it could incur $900 million in tariff-related costs this quarter alone, driven by shifting production from China to India.According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, moving even 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S. would cost $30 billion and take at least three years. Fully reshoring could require five to ten years and push iPhone prices to around $3,500 per unit due to high domestic labor and infrastructure costs.Trump's broader tariff plan includes a 10% universal tariff and a reduced 30% tariff on most Chinese goods, down from 145% earlier in the month. Electronics, including iPhones, were previously exempt from higher tariffs, but Apple's India plans appear to have reignited Trump's ire.Apple has committed $500 billion to U.S.-based initiatives in 2025, including a server facility in Houston and expanded data center capacity to support its AI product suite, Apple Intelligence. Despite this, large-scale chip manufacturing remains dependent on Asian supply chains, although some Apple chips are now being produced at a TSMC plant in Arizona.Analysts say reshoring is logistically unfeasible. Wedbush reiterated that full domestic production is a fairy tale, noting the complexity of replicating Asia's supply ecosystem.Investors should monitor potential pricing changes in Apple's next iPhone release this fall and watch for any formal tariff implementation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6c644746f094b:0-apple-aapl-faces-trump-tariff-threat-over-overseas-iphone-production/

Apple's Stock Still Not Pricing in Trump's Demands - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1748023200000,"By Dan GallagherWhat do you do when the most powerful person in the world demands the impossible? If you're an Apple shareholder, you better settle in for a long, uncomfortable haul.Apple's share price took another tumble on Friday, after President Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on any iPhone made overseas. This is part of his push to have all iPhones sold in the U.S. made there as well. The stock has been on a mostly downward slope since Apple's disappointing earnings report on May 1 and has put the company's market value below that of Microsoft and Nvidia.That's far from a worst-case scenario. Apple's share price Friday morning represented a multiple of about 26 times projected earnings for the next four quarters. That's nearly in line with the company's five year average, according to FactSet data.That means more downside is possible-even for a stock now off 22% so far this year. If Trump's demands stick, Apple will likely simply pay the 25% tariff on its iPhones made in India and pass at least some of those costs on to its customers. That would be a far more palatable option than trying to move its massive, Asia-based supply chain to the U.S., which would take many years and hundreds of billions of dollars in a best-case scenario.But paying the additional tariffs has its downside as well. In a report earlier this month, Edison Lee of Jefferies said every percentage point increase in tariffs above ""current assumptions"" translates into a 1.5% impact on Apple's pre-tax profits this year.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

Trump Threatens European Union With 50% Tariffs; ING Says Trade War Fears Return,1748022717000,"US President Donald Trump on Friday proposed a 50% tariff rate on the European Union, a move that ING Bank said has ""reignited"" concerns about a transatlantic trade war. In a social media post, Trump recommended that a ""straight"" 50% tariff rate be applied on the EU starting June 1, saying that his administration's talks with the bloc had stalled. When Trump disclosed his reciprocal tariffs early in April, he set a 20% charge on imports from the EU. Trump on Friday criticized the bloc for what he said were ""powerful"" trade barriers. US benchmark equity indexes were down intraday. ""A relatively calm week comes to an abrupt and disappointing close, serving as a stark reminder that we remain far from any 'beautiful trade deals' or return to normality,"" ING said in a report published Friday. ""Volatility is back.""In a separate social media post Friday, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple slid 2.7%. Trump declared a 90-day pause on certain tariffs for non-retaliating countries in April. Recently, the US and China agreed to suspend most levies on each other's goods for 90 days, while Washington reached a trade deal with the UK. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed countermeasures on up to 95 billion euros ($107.82 billion) worth of US imports if negotiations with the Trump administration collapse, Reuters reported May 8. The bloc has offered a 50-billion-euro trade deal that includes liquefied natural gas purchases and no tariffs on cars and industrial goods, ING said. The White House appears to be ""dissatisfied"" with the EU's efforts to secure a deal, according to the brokerage. The EU didn't respond to MT Newswires' request for comment on Trump's latest tariff threat. ""While the EU is slower to act, it has prepared a couple of retaliatory tariff measures which are currently scheduled to enter into force (July 14),"" ING wrote. ""If talks truly collapse, expect the EU to reach for its heaviest artillery, such as tighter regulations on US tech firms, delaying licenses or restricting public procurement access and limiting (intellectual property) rights and investment flows under the Anti-Coercion Instrument.""",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384854:0/

Apple Can't Really Make iPhones in the U.S. What It May Do to Offset Tariffs. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"Tae KimApple is facing difficult choices if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to put a big tariff on iPhones.On Friday, Trump said he would impose tariff of at least 25% on Apple iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the smartphones are made domestically. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the last earnings call that more iPhones sold in the U.S. will be made in India as Apple continues to geographically diversify its manufacturing footprint.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump wrote in a post on social-media platform Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president added.In early trading Friday, Apple shares fell by 2.6% to $196.17.Trump has been resolute about the topic. Last month, when asked by a reporter if Trump wants iPhones to be made domestically, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: ""Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.""Wall Street analysts, however, generally believe domestic iPhone manufacturing isn't tenable on a financial basis. The company relies on the contract manufacturer Foxconn to make the vast majority of its iPhones in China. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimates an iPhone made in the U.S. would be sold at $3,500 versus $1,000 today.""We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhone in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" Ives wrote on Friday, adding such a move to shift production would take five to 10 years.In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. Jobs bluntly replied: ""Those jobs aren't coming back,"" citing how only Asia has the supply chain ecosystem, from screws to rubber gaskets, along with thousands of specialized manufacturing engineers needed to make smartphones.If Trump doesn't back down, Apple faces several options to revamp its product strategy to mitigate the impact from tariffs.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has suggested Apple can remove the less-profitable, low-end storage models from its iPhone lineup. A ""targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,"" Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has said Apple can move new launches to a two-year schedule from annually. That would to help simplify the supply chain by extending the timeline on expensive manufacturing changes.Of course, Apple can decide to fight Trump and pressure him to revoke an iPhone tariff. The company could threaten to add a ""tariff surcharge"" to every sales receipt, so consumers know Trump's policies are responsible for the higher prices.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Market Chatter: Apple Ramps Up Efforts Against Texas Age Verification Bill,1748015848000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL Chief Executive Tim Cook called Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week, asking him to change or veto a new bill that would require app stores to verify the age of users and link minors' accounts to their parents, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing unnamed people familiar with the call.

""The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk,"" a spokesperson for Abbott was quoted as saying. To push back, Apple has hired more lobbyists and funded ads against the bill, the report added. The law, dubbed App Store accountability law, would make Apple and similar tech companies responsible for confirming a device owner's age and notifying parents when a child wants to download an app. ""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" an Apple spokesman was quoted as saying.

Apple's stock had already dipped 0.36% at market close yesterday.While Apple recently pledged $500 billion in U.S. investmentslargely focused on AI initiativesWedbush analysts see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the near-term given the upside-down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics. They warn a U.S.-built iPhone would carry a roughly $3,500 price tag and take five to ten years to scale, calling the idea a fairy tale.Why It Matters: Tariff uncertainty could squeeze margins and delay rollout plans, forcing investors to reconsider risk ahead of new device cycles.With Apple currently trading around $197, there's a notable gap between its market price and the average 12-month target of $230.90a potential upside of over 17%. The GF Value at $208.90 also suggests shares may be undervalued at current levels. The bullish target of $300 implies strong upside potential, though the low estimate of $141 signals caution.

U.S. Stock Futures Plunge on Trump Tariff Concerns,1748012160000,"Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet.After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%.

Pre-Markets Drop Hard on New Trump Tariff Talk,1748010600000,"Friday, May 23, 2025Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation.

Trump Threatens At Least 25% Tariffs on Apple's iPhones Made Outside US,1748010562000,"President Donald Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. This follows Trump's remark from last week that he had asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing in India. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their (iPhones) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""Apple shares fell 2.4% in Friday trading. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a Friday note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives estimate that manufacturing iPhones domestically could raise their price to about $3,500, adding that it would take five to 10 years to shift production to the US. During a quarterly earnings call at the beginning of this month, Cook said he expected the majority of iPhones sold in the US to have India as their source country for the ongoing three-month period, and China to be the country of origin for a ""vast majority"" of product sales outside the US. Cook's comments came as the US and China raised duties on each other's goods. However, Washington and Beijing recently agreed on a 90-day suspension of tariffs. ""We believe (Apple) will continue to navigate this complex tariff situation in a game of negotiations especially heading into iPhone 17 production this fall,"" Ives said Friday. Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on Apple's stock with a $270 price target. Apple in February announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years, including for an artificial intelligence server factory in Texas.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384708:0/
"Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on the EU, Stoking Fresh Trade Tensions — Barrons.com",1748010540000,"By George Glover and Reshma KapadiaPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would impose a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1 and threatened 25% tariffs on Apple iPhones if they weren't made in the U.S., reminding the market that the trade war is still very much on.Trump announced the levies in a post on Truth Social, citing the EU's ""powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies.""He said that he was ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the trading bloc, to take effect June 1. The duties won't apply to any products that are manufactured in the U.S., Trump added.Europe's flagship Stoxx 600 index plummeted after Trump said he would impose the levies. It was down 1.8% at last check. Paris's CAC 40 tumbled 2.8% and Frankfurt's Dax dropped 2.3%. U.S. stocks also fell.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and the European Commissioner For Trade Maroš efčovič are set to speak on a call later on Friday. The European Commission's spokesperson on trade declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment about Trump's Truth Social post.The latest threats come as trade talks have dragged out on multiple fronts and analysts like Owen Tedford at Beacon Policy Advisors has worried that Trump could look to make an example of a token country to pressure other priority countries to commit to some sort of framework agreement faster.""The EU is particularly problematic for the Trump administration because they are not caving to pressure,"" says Henrietta Treyz, head of research at political consultancy Veda Partners. The two sides aren't closer to a resolution on longstanding issues, including standards for agriculture and commodity purchases and a digital services tax.The escalation is similar to the approach the administration tried with China and then walked back with its recent pause. ""He has created an untenable tariff that effectively bans trade between the two nations,"" says Treyz, who expects tariffs on EU to rise, probably to 20% to 30%. ""By threatening 50% today, should he land at 20% or even 30%, it's possible the market sees that as 'de-escalation' and doesn't respond as negatively to the shock.""""Dialing tariffs up or down is one way the administration believes it can bring forth change in global supply chains and trade,"" says Juhi Dhawan, a macro strategist for Wellington Management via email, who expects the tariffs to be a tool used throughout the Trump presidency.The takeaway for investors: The relative calm around trade may have been misplaced. In a client note this morning, Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that container traffic hasn't rebounded after the 90-day pause and roll back on U.S.-China tariffs, a sign that the uncertainty is still paralyzing trade.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump Just Threatened Apple With a 25% Tariff -- Here's What Could Happen Next,1748008801000,"Donald Trump just fired a shot across Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL bow and markets flinched. In a fiery Truth Social post on Friday, the former U.S. President warned that if iPhones sold in America aren't made on American soil, Apple could be hit with a 25% tariff. Trump claimed he had already told Tim Cook to stop shifting production to India and ""anyplace else,"" suggesting a potential policy reversal if he's reelected.Investors didn't take it lightly. Apple stock sank 3.4% in the premarket trading at 7.49am, dragging Nasdaq (QQQ) futures into the red. The sell-off highlights just how sensitive markets remain to tariff talk especially when it comes to tech giants with deep global supply chains. Despite Apple's multi-billion-dollar U.S. investment pledges, the company still relies heavily on China and has recently ramped up iPhone manufacturing in India a strategic hedge that now faces political headwinds.Apple hasn't commented yet, but the message from Trump is loud and clear: bring jobs back or pay the price. A 25% tariff would hit Apple's margins or force it to pass costs to consumers neither of which would sit well with shareholders. For now, this is just talk. But with the 2024 race heating up and reshoring back in the spotlight, Apple investors may want to start scenario planning.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:17ef80ced094b:0-trump-just-threatened-apple-with-a-25-tariff-here-s-what-could-happen-next/
Apple Shares Fall on Trump Threat: 'Make iPhones in U.S. or Pay 25%',1748008471000,"May 23 - Apple NASDAQ:AAPL shares dropped by as much as 4% in early Friday trading after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured domestically.The comments, posted on Trump's Truth Social platform, targeted Apple's offshore production strategy.

If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S., he wrote.The post comes amid reports that Apple's key supplier, Foxconn (FXCOF), plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new facility in Tamil Nadu, India.

Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.,1748007840000,"By Britney NguyenPresident Donald Trump said Apple must pay a 25% tariff if it doesn't rely on domestic production of iPhones for the U.S. marketShares of Apple Inc. were down more than 2% shortly after Friday's open after President Donald Trump threatened the company with a tariff if it doesn't make iPhones for the U.S. market stateside. One analyst called Trump's dream of domestic iPhone production a ""fairy tale.""""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) that I expect their [iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""However, analysts at Evercore ISI said in April they didn't see iPhone production moving into the U.S., ""as the higher labor costs alone would drive a >50% increase in iPhone manufacturing costs"" - double the tariff Trump is now threatening to put on Apple.""This implies that even under a 50% global baseline tariff it would not make financial sense to produce the iPhone domestically,"" Evercore said last month.Earlier this month, the president said he ""had a little problem"" with the Apple chief during a meeting between the two in Qatar. Trump has taken issue with the iPhone maker's further expansion into India. Apple doesn't produce any smartphones in the U.S., but has been diversifying its supply chain away from China since pandemic-era lockdowns and as geopolitical tensions between the two countries have intensified. The company has moved production into countries including India and Vietnam, but the Trump administration is still pushing for the company to bring its manufacturing stateside.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.As Trump floated massive tariffs on goods imported from China earlier this year, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, pointed out that most of the components used in iPhones are made abroad.""If U.S. tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come,"" Ives said in an April note. An iPhone made in the U.S. could cost $3,500, Ives said - more than double the current $1,000 price tag.Ives reiterated his point in a note on Friday, saying that building iPhones in the U.S. ""would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of $3,500 if it was made in the US.""He estimated that shifting production to the U.S. would take between five to 10 years, and called the idea ""a fairy tale that is not feasible.""In April, analysts at Gimme Credit said moving some iPhone production to the U.S. ""cannot be done immediately.""""It would take meaningful time and money to build and develop the physical infrastructure,"" the analysts said. ""More importantly, it is doubtful that the U.S. could provide the necessary labor force, both in terms of quality and quantity.""The analysts noted that Apple would likely still have to import some components from China.India produced about 20% of Apple's iPhones - or more than 40 million devices - in the past year ending in March, according to Bloomberg. The company is now focused on sourcing most of its iPhones sold in the U.S. from India by the end of 2026, the report said.-Britney NguyenThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

European stocks fall as Trump proposes 50% tariff on EU imports; says talks with them ‘going nowhere’,1748007559000,"President Donald Trump on Friday said he is recommending a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in trade talks with the 27-nation bloc. The proposed tariffs would take effect on June 1 and mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Washington and Brussels.Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “The EU has been very difficult to deal with…our discussions with them are going nowhere!” The announcement came less than 30 minutes after Trump threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones if the company does not begin manufacturing them within the United States.The dual threats reflect Trump’s increasingly aggressive trade posture as his administration races to strike deals before existing global tariff agreements expire in July. Source: Truth SocialBrussels awaits scheduled call between EU and US trade representativesThe European Commission declined immediate comment, saying it would await the outcome of a scheduled call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, set for 15:00 GMT. The call is expected to be tense, as Greer reportedly plans to inform Sefcovic that recent EU proposals fall well short of US expectations.The timing of Trump’s announcement surprised many in Brussels. Just weeks earlier, the US had agreed to a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs, offering both sides time to negotiate. That truce was meant to stabilize markets following Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcement on April 2, which had already roiled investors by introducing a 20% tariff later revised down to 10%.Currently, EU exports to the US are only subject to the new “baseline” tariff. A shift to 50% duties would represent a dramatic departure and potentially provoke retaliatory measures from Europe.Market reaction swift and negativeThe financial fallout from Trump’s statement was immediate. European stocks fell sharply, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.9%. Germany’s DAX dropped 2.3%, France’s CAC 40 fell 2.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 lost 1.3%.Sectors most vulnerable to global trade volatility were hit hardest. Banking stocks sold off heavily, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale losing 6% and 5.5% respectively. Italian lender Unicredit was down 4.2%. The regional Stoxx Banks index slumped 3.6% as investors assessed the indirect risks to lenders from a potential economic downturn triggered by tariffs.Consumer cyclical and luxury goods sectors were also under pressure. Swatch Group and Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica were each down about 5%.Bond markets, a typical haven during uncertainty, saw increased demand. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell 8 basis points to 2.56%, while yields on French, Italian, and Swiss bonds also declined.Bond yields move inversely to prices, meaning investors were moving money into safer assets.Economists warn of stagflation risksCommenting on the potential consequences of such high tariffs, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said, Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box , Goolsbee warned the tariffs could create a “stagflationary” scenario by increasing production costs and slowing output, all while raising consumer prices. “That’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” he added.The EU was the second-largest buyer of US goods in 2022, importing nearly $351 billion worth of American products. A 50% tariff could severely impact transatlantic trade flows and unsettle multinational corporations relying on open trade channels.Trump’s broader strategy remains unclearThe Trump administration is currently in talks with over a dozen governments in an effort to renegotiate trade deals before automatic tariff resets take effect in early July. However, several foreign officials have expressed concern over Washington’s unpredictable demands, noting the difficulty in making concessions when tariffs can be reimposed without warning.Trump has long argued that European nations benefit disproportionately from trade with the United States. His push for “reciprocal” tariffs seeks to align duty rates, though critics say such measures risk igniting full-blown trade wars and undermining global supply chains.With less than two weeks remaining until the proposed 50% tariff would take effect, attention now turns to upcoming discussions between US and EU trade officials. A failure to find common ground could deepen the rift between two of the world’s largest economic blocs.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:5bb71649d094b:0-european-stocks-fall-as-trump-proposes-50-tariff-on-eu-imports-says-talks-with-them-going-nowhere/

Trump stated he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically, the investment firm said. Despite Apple's $500 billion investment in US-based AI projects, analysts say it is unrealistic to shift iPhone manufacturing to the US soon due to high costs and logistical challenges, Wedbush said. Experts estimate that making iPhones in the US would drive retail prices to around $3,500, making the plan financially unworkable, Wedbush analysts noted. During Apple's March earnings call, Cook revealed over 50% of US-bound iPhones are now made in India, and this could increase to 60%-65% by fall, Wedbush noted.

Apple has been the worst Big Tech stock lately. Here's why investors are missing the big picture.,1748089800000,"By Laila MaidanApple's stock has sold off on tariff fears, but the company has a healthy business underpinned by a sticky ecosystem and robust array of services offeringsOne thing Apple users can agree on is that it's hard to imagine trading an iPhone or a MacBook for a Samsung smartphone or a Lenovo laptop. That's probably the biggest thing Apple has going for it amid the tariff noise.Yet Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) has been under pressure lately. As large technology stocks have roared back in May, Apple shares have missed out. The stock is down 8% so far this month. It's the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that's in the red over that period, according to FactSet data. It's also the worst-performing stock of the bunch on a year-to-date basis, down 22%.Friday's tariff-related scare added to the pain. Apple's stock closed 3% lower to clinch its eighth loss in a row.Don't miss: Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.But even as President Donald Trump threatened Apple on Friday with a 25% tariff if it didn't bring its manufacturing into the U.S., analysts aren't flinching and don't think investors should either. But that point comes with a caveat that's like a pilot telling passengers they're about to experience some turbulence. That's true, too, of Apple's stock. The short-term ride might be unpleasant, but arrival is still on time. So, if you're already invested, it's probably not a good idea to get off midflight.That said, over a three- to five-year timeframe, there's a lot of reason to be confident in the company's growth prospects because the products are part of an admirably sticky ecosystem, according to Gil Luria, the head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. His view is that the services tacked on to Apple's hardware products will keep customers coming back. It's also true that many who buy one Apple product, like an iPhone, tend to buy another, like a MacBook, Luria noted. In short, the recent stock weakness isn't a statement on the health of the business. It's more of a relationship issue between Trump and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.""If you get to a point where the president is posting in such a confrontational manner, that means the negotiation isn't going well,"" said Luria.It's a setback, but it's not bad enough to send Luria back to his model to rework his outlook for the company. While an additional 25% tariff would hurt the company's profitability, he believes there's still a chance that negotiations between Apple and the White House could stave off the worst. If Apple products did take an additional 25% tariff hit, that would hurt earnings in the nearer term. However, the costs could be spread out by partially raising prices and passing some costs along to parts suppliers, Luria said. Additionally, Apple wouldn't be at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as Trump noted that Samsung (KR:005930) and other makers of smartphones would also be slapped with 25% tariffs on devices made overseas as they're imported to the U.S.Ask the Moneyist: Is now a good time to buy an iPhone?Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, chuckled and called the tariff threat ""noise,"" adding that it doesn't impact how he views Apple. ""I don't think you can take too much away from these headlines,"" he said. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that Cook's relationship with the president isn't as strong as it may once have been, he noted. Under the first Trump administration, Cook was able to secure a tariff exemption.Valuationwise, Apple's stock is trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, below its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. But Apple could see the slowest sales growth among the group, with a two-year estimated compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.1% through 2026. What that all means, said Luria, is that, despite slowed sales, investors still have a lot of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Apple's stock trades at a premium compared with the S&P 500 SPX, which has a forward P/E of 21.2 and a two-year estimated sales CAGR slightly above Apple's at 5.6%. Meanwhile, Apple's forward P/E is slightly below that for the S&P 500 information-technology sector, which stands at 26.8. Yet the IT sector has a two-year sales CAGR more than double Apple's, at 11.3%.Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, says Apple's bigger problem is that Siri's integration with Apple Intelligence has fallen behand. The company is at risk of losing market share to any contender able to release life-changing generative AI services. That's something Mortonson believes could happen through Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pixel phones or through Google's partnership with Samsung Galaxy and the integration of generative AI into that smartphone.That risk means he wouldn't suggest investors be overweight the stock, and he believes a stock like Alphabet is a better bet given its cheaper forward P/E at 17.3 with a two-year estimated sales CAGR double Apple's, at 10.7%.The next important event for Apple will be its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 9. The company will have a chance to wow customers with any updates, particularly on Apple Intelligence. But until then, Luria believes, he said, that investors should suspend judgment about the stock.Overall, investing is based on an individual's risk tolerance. While Apple is still seen as a solid company, and a good stock to own, there may be better risk-reward opportunities elsewhere. As for investors who already own the stock because they like the company and believe in the business's long-term prospects, panic selling based on negative headlines is never a good strategy. Instead, investors should focus on the company's key drivers. And a big one right now is how well Apple can compete in generative AI services because that will help drive hardware sales and increase demand for Apple's services segment, including cloud storage.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"“No chance” iPhones can be made in the US, analysts say — options Apple could explore instead to tackle tariffs",1748073600000,"Apple is staring down a major supply chain and pricing dilemma after President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the United States unless the tech giant begins manufacturing the devices domestically. Trump’s remarks, posted on Truth Social and reiterated later to reporters at the White House, are the latest escalation in his push for US-based production by large multinationals.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote, warning that otherwise “a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.”The president’s comments come as Apple has been ramping up production in India, seeking to diversify away from its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing amid rising geopolitical tensions and pandemic-era disruptions. CEO Tim Cook recently said more iPhones sold in the US would be made in India, a shift that may now be politically fraught.Analysts say iPhone making in the US unfeasible; say threat a negotiation tacticApple shares dropped almost 3% on Friday trading following Trump’s post, falling to $195.44. The prospect of steep tariffs raised concerns across financial markets, with analysts warning of significant cost implications and logistical hurdles should Apple try to comply.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimated that manufacturing iPhones in the US could push retail prices to $3,500, a dramatic increase from today’s average $1,000. “We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,” Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Morningstar analyst William Kerwin echoed those sentiments, describing domestic iPhone manufacturing as unfeasible in the medium term. “To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater US investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone,” he said.Potential strategies for Apple under tariff threatFaced with this new pressure, Apple may explore various strategies to blunt the impact of a potential tariff hike.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring suggested that Apple could cut less profitable models from its iPhone lineup, focusing instead on higher-margin units to reduce the blow. A “targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,” Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.Another option floated by analysts involves stretching the product release cycle. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple could switch from an annual to a biennial launch schedule, simplifying supply chains and production timelines.Apple may also decide to confront the administration directly, publicly tying higher prices to Trump’s trade stance. One proposal discussed in analyst circles is for Apple to add a “tariff surcharge” to each US sales receipt, making consumers aware of how much more they’re paying because of the new tariffs.Constraints that limit Apple’s US productionFor now, most analysts agree that relocating iPhone production to the US is impractical. Apple’s manufacturing relies heavily on China-based partner Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers and taps into a dense web of suppliers, logistics firms, and engineers—none of which are easily replicable in the US.“The idea of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said, adding that even if the company decided to pursue the move, it would take five to ten years to make it a reality.The challenges are not new. In 2011, when President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the US, Jobs reportedly replied, “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” referring to Asia’s unmatched industrial infrastructure and labour scale.Some of Apple’s suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, are expanding US operations under pressure. However, Foxconn appears unlikely to significantly boost its American footprint. The firm scaled back a highly publicized $10 billion Wisconsin plant and has instead committed $1.49 billion to its India operations.Likely bearing of 25% tariff on Apple’s earningsUBS analyst David Vogt estimated that if a 25% tariff were applied to 70 million iPhones annually imported from China and India, Apple’s earnings per share could take a hit of about $0.51. Wall Street currently expects Apple to earn $7.18 per share this fiscal year.As pressure mounts from Washington, Apple is left navigating a volatile mix of political demands, economic realities, and consumer expectations. Whether Trump’s threat is a hard policy shift or a negotiation tactic, it has already forced a reckoning over the limits of globalization and the fragility of tech supply chains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:669d8abeb094b:0-no-chance-iphones-can-be-made-in-the-us-analysts-say-options-apple-could-explore-instead-to-tackle-tariffs/

Tim Cook's Bad Year Keeps Getting Worse — WSJ,1748052000000,"By Rolfe WinklerFor Tim Cook, the hits keep coming.On Friday, President Trump targeted Apple with new demands that the company make iPhones in the U.S., threatening 25% tariffs if the company doesn't comply. ""Rise and shine Tim Cook,"" Trump whisperer Laura Loomer posted on X, reminding the Apple CEO he is at the center of the president's trade bull's-eye.That is just one of the threats Cook has confronted in what has appeared to be a no good, very bad year for Apple. Aside from Trump, Cook is facing off against two U.S. judges, European and worldwide regulators, state and federal lawmakers, and even a creator of the iPhone, to say nothing of the cast of rivals outrunning Apple in artificial intelligence.Each is a threat to Apple's hefty profit margins, long the company's trademark and the reason investors drove its valuation above $3 trillion before any other company. Shareholders are still Cook's most important constituency. The stock's 25% fall from its peak shows their concern about whether he — or anyone — can navigate the choppy 2025 waters.What can be said for Apple is that the company is patient, and that has often paid off in the past.This past week, a key architect of the iPhone, Jony Ive, joined OpenAI to develop a next-generation device that weans consumers off screens. After he announced a deal to sell his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported that a key goal is to deliver an AI-powered device that shifts the current computing paradigm in which humans stare at black rectangles all day. Later, OpenAI told employees it is aiming to make 100 million AI ""companion"" devices.It is hard to gauge the potential for a brand-new computing device from a company that has never made one. Yet the fact that it is coming from the man who led design of the iPhone and other hit Apple products means it can't be dismissed. Apple sees the threat coming: ""You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as that sounds,"" an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified in a court case this month.Apple isn't expected to show any AI breakthroughs at its annual developer conference in a couple of weeks. And Cook said on Apple's recent earnings call that a more personalized Siri assistant hasn't arrived yet because what the company has in the shop doesn't yet meet Apple's ""high quality bar.""The company might not need to be first in AI. It didn't make the first music player, smartphone or tablet. It waited, and then conquered each market with the best. A question is whether a strategy that has been successful in devices will work for AI.Apple makes billions in revenue from its services business, carrying gross profit margins north of 70%, compared with less than 40% for hardware. A judge wrote in a recent ruling that Apple ignored her injunction to allow app developers to bypass its steep fees on app store purchases. ""Cook chose poorly"" in listening to advice to ignore her, she wrote. European Union regulators want Apple to make similar changes abroad, and worldwide regulators could follow suit.State and federal lawmakers are threatening the app store with legislation to require Apple to verify user ages. While the bottom-line impact of such a move is unclear, it could reduce teen spending or even empower parents to limit teen engagement on smartphones more fully.Meanwhile, the judge overseeing an antitrust case against Alphabet's Google could demand that the search giant stop paying Apple some $20 billion annually to be the default search engine in Safari, revenue that is basically pure profit for Apple.Of course, all of these issues pale next to threats to Cook's greatest creation — Apple's supply chain in China.Trump's demands notwithstanding, there isn't much Apple can do to move iPhone production, which remains centered in China. While it is shifting final assembly of more iPhones to India, many of the components inside the device still come from across the Himalayas.The strategy gives Apple some flexibility to arbitrage different tariffs for U.S.-bound devices assembled in the two countries.Trump wants a made-in-America iPhone. Such a device could cost over $3,000, so he is unlikely to get one.Cook might try to placate him by shifting production of something else to the U.S., and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent may have given Cook an out on iPhones when he said Friday that the administration wants Apple to make more of its chips here.Apple already announced plans to facilitate production of AI servers in Texas, but Trump clearly expects more. With frequent calls to the White House and a meeting there in the past week, Cook, it seems, is negotiating his next peace offering.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009759:0/
"Trump's iPhone Wish 'A Fairy Tale,' Wedbush Says — Market Talk",1748004420000,"Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is ""a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" says Wedbush's Dan Ives in a research note. President Trump lobbied fresh criticism on Apple on his social media platform and called for a 25% tariff if the company doesn't manufacture and build its product in the U.S. Apple has moved iPhone production to India and away from China in recent years.

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/
'Tariff Man' Is in a Bad Mood Ahead of the Memorial Day Weekend — Barrons.com,1748004300000,"By Martin BaccardaxJust when you thought it was safe to go back into the water.Stocks haven't had a great run this week and were on pace for their biggest five-day slide since the ""Liberation Day"" lows in early April. But with the S&P 500 just 5% from its all-time peak, Nvidia earnings just around the corner, and the bond market settling from its recent tantrum, you could make a solid case for optimism heading into the Memorial Day weekend.And then it happened.President Donald Trump, fresh from hosting a controversial dinner for well-heeled meme coin investors last night at his Mar-a-Lago residence, took to his social-media platform and fired off two messages that touched on his go-to theme: tariffs.Likely reacting to a report that Apple was looking to expand its India-based supply chain, Trump warned the tech giant would face a 25% levy if the iPhones it sells in the U.S. aren't made in the U.S.Trump, who in 2018 said he was a 'Tariff Man,"" followed that missive with a threat to impose a ""straight 50%"" tariff on imports from the European Union, citing what he has long claimed are unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, and the targeting of American companies by the region's competition authorities.Markets reacted in kind, taking a sleepy pre-long weekend premarket into another roiling tariff casino, with futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 now suggesting a near 100-point slump for the benchmark.The market's benchmark volatility gauge, the CBOE Group's VIX index, surged more than 15% to 24.09 in the wake of the president's remarks, suggesting traders are now expecting daily swings of 1.5%, or 88 points, for the S&P 500, a 37.5% increase from earlier this week.The merits of the president's case are, for the most part, besides the point at this stage, and markets have largely stopped debating the veracity of his claims or the impact that his threats might have on growth prospects in the world's biggest economy.What they can't ignore, however, is the impact they're likely to have on corporate profits, be it in terms of Apple's bottom line or that of the myriad U.S. companies that rely on overseas sales to drive overall earnings.They also can't discount the fact that corporate leaders, try as they might, aren't able to insulate their companies from this tariff-theme wroth.Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many others, donated to the president's inauguration fund and attended the event in Washington, sitting near to Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Chairman Jeff Bezos, and unveiled a massive $500 billion U.S. investment plan in late February.It hardly seems to matter now.Apple stock was down 3.1% in premarket trading, a pace that would drag one of the world's most valuable companies deeper into bear market territory.Investors, meanwhile, will be left hanging into the early spring holiday, with the S&P 500 at risk of losing a big chunk of its hard-fought May gains as another round of tariff angst, alongside recession worries, inflation pressures, and a bond market freakout adding to the rising wall of worry.For a man who enjoys a round of golf as much as he does, Trump sure knows how to ruin a good Memorial Day weekend.Write to Martin Baccardax at martin.baccardax@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/
Trump threatens Apple with 25% tariffs over foreign iPhone production; shares fall,1748003211000,"Apple’s decision to expand its manufacturing footprint in India has triggered a sharp response from US President Donald Trump, who warned on Friday that iPhones sold in the United States must be made domestically—or face heavy tariffs. The warning marks a new escalation in Trump’s global tariff strategy, directly targeting one of the world’s most valuable companies.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”The move marks Trump’s first direct trade threat against a single company, setting a precedent for potential future action against other multinationals who rely heavily on overseas production.Apple shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading after the post, dragging down broader market sentiment.Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped by 112 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures both declined by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Source: Truth SocialTrump’s warning follows report about Foxconn’s $1.5bn plant in IndiaThe president’s statement comes on the heels of reports about Apple’s key supplier, Foxconn’s plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new component plant near Chennai, India, further entrenching the country’s position in Apple’s global supply chain. According to a Financial Times report, the plant will assemble iPhone display modules, which play a vital role in the touchscreen interface and visual quality of the device.Two Indian government officials told FT that the facility, located in Tamil Nadu’s Oragadam industrial region, has already received clearance from local authorities. It is expected to create around 14,000 jobs and become one of the largest electronics-sector investments in the country.Foxconn disclosed the investment via a filing on the London Stock Exchange this week, noting that the funds will be routed through its Indian subsidiary, Yuzhan Technology India.Currently, Apple manufactures around 85% of its iPhones in China, with India accounting for roughly 15%. The company has been slowly increasing its Indian production share, partly to diversify its supply chain away from China amid rising geopolitical risks and to leverage India’s more favourable trade ties with the United States.Escalation of frustrationTrump’s threat follows a more measured statement he made last week on the same issueAt an event in Qatar last week, Trump revealed that he had directly confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company’s growing operations in India, despite its pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said. “I told him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.”He accused Apple of taking advantage of preferential treatment in the US while concentrating its manufacturing overseas, especially in China. “We’ve treated you really good,” he said. “Now you got to build for us.”The high costs of Apple’s US manufacturingDespite political pressure, shifting iPhone assembly to the United States remains economically challenging. Industry analysts estimate that relocating production would cause labour costs to skyrocket—from $290 per month per worker in India to about $2,900 under US wage laws. This would increase the cost of assembling each device from around $30 to $390.Such a move could slash Apple’s profit per iPhone from $450 to just $60 unless the company raises its prices. Some estimates suggest that building the devices entirely in the US could push the retail price to nearly $3,000—three times the current price point.This cost disparity has long been a key reason for Apple’s international production strategy. While India offers relatively lower costs and improving infrastructure, bringing manufacturing stateside would be financially unsustainable without a significant increase in retail prices or a dramatic reduction in margins.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:87ff0993a094b:0-trump-threatens-apple-with-25-tariffs-over-foreign-iphone-production-shares-fall/
Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Tim Cook Called Texas Governor to Stop Online Child-Safety Legislation — WSJ,1748036400000,"By Rolfe Winkler, Amrith Ramkumar and Meghan BobrowskyApple stepped up efforts in recent weeks to fight Texas legislation that would require the iPhone-maker to verify ages of device users, even drafting Chief Executive Tim Cook into the fight.The CEO called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week to ask for changes to the legislation or, failing that, for a veto, according to people familiar with the call. These people said that the conversation was cordial and that it made clear the extent of Apple's interest in stopping the bill.Abbott has yet to say whether he will sign it, though it passed the Texas legislature with veto-proof majorities.In the weeks leading up to its passage, Apple hired more lobbyists to pressure lawmakers. An interest group it funds targeted the Austin, Texas, area with ads saying the legislation is ""backed by porn websites."" Google also finances the interest group and is fighting the legislation. The law's supporters say adult-content sellers don't favor it.Texas would be the largest state to adopt what is called an app-store accountability law. Similar laws have been proposed across at least nine states and adopted in one, Utah. Federal legislation also has been introduced. Meta Platforms — along with social-media companies X and Snap — also have played a role in the lobbying fight, advocating that what is known as ""age-gating"" should be the responsibility of app stores rather than individual apps.The Texas bill is turning heads because its success in the second-biggest state with a Republican legislature could foreshadow adoption across the country, potentially creating new costs for Apple and Google, as well as for some app makers.The law requires those running app stores, primarily Apple and Google, to verify the age of a device owner. If the owner is a minor, their app-store account would have to be tied to a parent's account. The parent would be notified when their child wants to download an app and have to approve or deny the download.Proponents argue that such laws will give parents more control over their children's use of smartphones, and that children aren't legally allowed to agree to apps' terms of service in the first place.Critics say such a law could impose costs on a swath of apps whose content isn't controversial. They also say the bills are allowing Meta and other apps to shunt responsibility for online safety onto others.One reason the laws are being crafted to have app stores verify ages, and not individual apps that are viewed as problematic, is that the latter approach would likely be struck down on free speech grounds, say those who have helped shepherd the bills.Meta has 13 lobbyists working in Texas, according to the state's Ethics Commission. Apple has six and Google has seven.An Apple spokesman said that the company wants to strengthen online safety for children but that the Texas bill threatens user privacy. ""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" he said.Meta has said that verifying ages at the app store-level is easier and helps preserve privacy, by only having children's ages stored in one place instead of on every app they access.A spokesman for Abbott said ""safety and online privacy for Texas children remains a priority for Governor Abbott. The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk.""The age-verification bills are the latest threat to Apple's lucrative apps business. Last month, a judge forced the company to allow app developers to avoid Apple's steep commissions on app-store sales, a move the European Union is also pushing for.It is also the latest sign that Cook is playing a personal role lobbying for the company. When it comes to tariffs, he is known to call President Trump directly to advocate for the company's position. He was spotted visiting the White House on Tuesday. He also personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.Apple lobbyists successfully blocked a similar effort in Louisiana last spring, but that bill has returned this year and is advancing.Some states are moving ahead with app-store bills anyway.""The more we can help parents understand what their children are really interacting with and give them tools to help them make good parenting decisions, then I think we're all better off,"" said Angela Paxton, the Texas state senator who sponsored the legislation.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com, Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523005634:0/
"Trump Threatens Fresh Tariffs on EU, iPhones and Rival Devices — WSJ",1748034900000,"By Gavin Bade, Meridith McGraw and Rolfe WinklerWASHINGTON — President Trump fired new salvos in the global trade war on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on imported goods from the European Union and new duties on iPhones and other smartphones made overseas.Trump said the EU had been ""very difficult to deal with"" on trade in a Friday morning social-media post. Less than a half hour earlier, he threatened Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, with a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones made overseas.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" he wrote on Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.Later on Friday, in Oval Office comments, Trump said those tariffs will include ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair."" Trump appeared to be referring to companies that manufacture smartphones outside of the U.S. He added that the tariffs would likely be imposed in late June.The threats build on the president's effort to pressure CEOs to move more manufacturing to America and punish allies whose trade policies the White House argues are unfair. Cook met with Trump at the White House this week, according to a White House official.The White House didn't immediately provide additional comment. Apple declined to comment. An EU representative declined to comment. Apple shares declined 3% on Friday.Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU imports, which was later paused for 90 days to allow for negotiations. A 10% baseline levy remains, and some specific EU products, like cars, are subject to higher tariff rates.The U.S. president has long criticized European nations on trade, and he said in his Friday morning social-media post that trade discussions with the bloc had made little progress. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!"" he wrote. He said the 50% tariff would go into effect on June. 1.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he is ""not looking for a deal."" Minutes later, he said the EU likely wants an agreement to avoid the tariffs, and added, ""We're going to see what happens, but right now it's going on on June 1."" Trump listed Europe's nontariff barriers, regulations and lawsuits against U.S. firms as prime irritants driving his threat.European officials had expressed cautious optimism in recent days that talks were progressing after the two sides exchanged documents outlining some of the trade issues they are seeking to discuss. However, they acknowledged they remain far apart in their positions.The EU has been unwilling to move on some of Trump's demands, particularly the value-added tax, which the administration views as an unfair trade practice, but EU Economy Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said the tax is off the table in negotiations. This week, Dombrovskis needled the Trump team at a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting by saying their trade deals would be a ""suboptimal"" outcome for the global economy and suggesting that U.S. allies had to compromise with the U.S. on trade language in a joint statement.EU Trade Commissioner Maroš efčovič spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, hours after Trump's initial threat. In a social-media post after the call, he said the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, but added that trade between the U.S. and EU ""must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.""""We stand ready to defend our interests,"" he added.During the meeting of finance ministers in Canada this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told EU officials they have a ""collective action problem,"" warning that progress on reaching a trade deal with Europe had slowed because each nation has different priorities for an agreement, according to a U.S. official.Bessent on Friday hit out at Europe again, saying on Fox News that ""with the exception of the EU, most [nations] are negotiating in good faith.""Last week, Trump chided Cook for Apple's plans to shift final assembly for many U.S.-bound devices to India, and he reiterated his demands that the company bring manufacturing back to America. He called the CEO his ""friend,"" but suggested that Apple's plan to invest some $500 billion in America wasn't enough.Bernard Arnault, CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, this week urged European lawmakers to take a more pragmatic, deal-focused approach to trade negotiations with the U.S.""The United States is the No. 1 market in the world,"" Arnault told French senators during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. ""It's very important for Europe to reach an agreement with the United States. As of now, it seems to me things are off to a bad start.""Arnault, who first met Trump when the two men were real-estate developers in New York in the 1980s, also warned against adopting a confrontational tone.""If we threaten him — if we say, for example, 'We're coming in and we're going to take this or that measure,' or, 'We no longer want our companies to invest in the United States' — we'll get the opposite result,"" Arnault said.After Trump raised tariffs on goods made in China, Apple accelerated its effort to make most U.S.-bound iPhones in India. Such a move would allow it to claim India as the ""country of origin"" and pay the lower duties facing that nation.Bessent, in his Friday interview with Fox, said the administration is trying to persuade Apple to build semiconductors in the U.S.""I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities...is this external production, especially in semiconductors. A large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors,"" Bessent said. ""We would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Bessent said he met with Cook this week.Technology experts have said that while shifting some iPhone manufacturing to America is possible, building the full stack of iPhone components and assembling it in the U.S. would be challenging and costly. IPhones contain a patchwork of sophisticated parts, sourced from many countries and put together primarily in China. America doesn't have facilities that resemble the infrastructure developed in China, nor does it have skilled manpower to assemble iPhones at that scale.Apple shares declined slightly more than the market, but not to an extent that indicates investor concern that the company would be subject to the 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones. ""The market is obviously concluding that this is just a negotiation,"" said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.He said he expects the eventual outcome for Apple will be for the company to make some additional components in the U.S., but not iPhones themselves.Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com, Meridith McGraw at Meridith.McGraw@WSJ.com and Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523004234:0/

"Stocks Fall on Tariff Broadside, After Week of Bond Market Agita — WSJ",1748032860000,"By Matt WirzThe markets started the week with fears of a deficit crisis and ended with renewed angst over tariffs.President Trump renewed his tariff campaign Friday, threatening to impose a 50% rate on the European Union and warning Apple that foreign-made iPhones could face significant levies. Shares of Apple lost 3%, while broader stock indexes finished the day lower by 0.6% to 1%. The S&P 500 index ended the week down 2.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite both fell 2.5%.""I'm not so worried about the stock action,"" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management. ""A 2% to 3% drop is just normal trading compared to what investors have gotten used to in the last couple of months.""More worrying is the steady rise in Treasury bond yields since Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. government and the House of Representatives passed a tax bill that could add to the country's large budget deficit.The 30-year Treasury bond yield finished the week at 5.036%, its highest level since 2023, while the 10-year yield ended the week at 4.508%, about the same as its high point during the worst of the market turmoil in April. Bond yields rise when prices fall. In contrast, the S&P 500 is still about 16% above its lowest point in April.Stock investors are relatively sanguine because ""they now know that Trump will pivot on trade,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, referring to the president's softer stance since late April. Stock prices would have dropped far more dramatically had Trump made his comments about Europe in March, he said. ""The market has finally figured out not to overreact to every salvo.""Still, the fresh tariff threats from the White House are aimed at core pillars of global commerce: one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. European stocks fell about 0.9% and investors sought shelter in haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, weighing on the dollar. Gold prices rallied.Senior U.S. and EU trade officials held a prearranged call on Friday, with neither side changing its position significantly in comments afterward. G-7 finance and central bank chiefs issued a vague statement Thursday that made no mention of levies, and only one mention of ""trade, "" after a summit that featured both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and EU representation.On Apple, Trump said in a Friday post that he has told Apple CEO Tim Cook ""that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.""Elevated Treasury bond yields indicate that traders are also worried that diminishing demand for U.S. government bonds will increase the country's borrowing costs. That would bring knock-on effects on large and small businesses by raising the cost of corporate loans and slowing economic activity.In another cause for concern, the value of the dollar is dropping even as bond-yields rise. That could indicate the U.S. currency is losing some of its appeal as a haven for foreign savers and corporations.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523008752:0/
Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Apple Is Unlikely to Escape Tariffs This Time. Trump Is Doubling Down. — Barrons.com,1748031480000,"By Adam Clark and Angela PalumboApple stock was dropping on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the U.S.""I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump said in a post on social-media platform Truth Social early on Friday.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.The president doubled down on his post in a meeting at the White House on Friday, where he told reporters that not only would he put tariffs on Apple if they don't move production to the U.S., but he would also place levies on Samsung and other smartphone products makers who import to the country to ensure fairness. He added that those tariffs would potentially start at the end of June.""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs,'"" Trump added.While tariffs are paid by the importer of record at the time the goods enter the country, economists generally agree that the increased costs are passed on to suppliers and consumers.In an interview with Fox News Friday morning, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he thinks one of the country's ""greatest vulnerabilities is this external production, especially in semiconductors, and a large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors, so we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Apple shares fell 3% to $195.27 on Friday. The stock has now fallen 22% this year, compared to the 1.3% decline of the S&P 500. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Owen Tedford, an analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, says the Apple tariff threats could be tied to the levies expected out of the administration's Section 232 investigations into certain sectors.""It would suggest that Trump is at least considering not giving the company an exemption from the duties,"" Tedford said. Apple was exempted from tariffs during Trump's first term in office. ""It also implies that there is at least some consideration to cover electronics devices as part of the [Section 232] tariffs that were expected to primarily hit semiconductors.""These sector-oriented tariffs are expected to be stickier but the timing still isn't still clear, especially as the administration tries to strike trade agreements with various countries related to its April 2 blitz of tariffs.As companies and countries await trade decisions from the president, Apple has already started making changes. It's increasing production of iPhones in India in a bid to diversify its production in response to the tariffs Trump has imposed on China, previously the main hub for the company's smartphone production. Trump has publicly criticized the move, saying he had ""a little problem"" with Apple CEO Cook and calling on the company to build in the U.S. instead.The Wall Street Journal reported that Cook met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, citing a White House official. Apple has already committed to investing more than $500 billion and hiring around 20,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years, although it unclear how much of that sum is new.The threatened 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured overseas is still likely to be considerably less than the cost of producing 'made in USA' devices. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has estimated that making an iPhone in the U.S. would probably lead to a retail price of around $3,500 compared with around $1,000 currently, and it would take years to build the necessary production capacity.""We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,"" Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Ives isn't alone in this belief. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin wrote in a research note on Friday that he doesn't think iPhone production in the U.S. is ""feasible in the medium term.""""To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater U.S. investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone.""Among other electronics like semiconductors and personal computers, Apple's products are temporarily exempt from the hefty reciprocal tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. However, Apple recently said it's already taking a financial hit from tariffs. CEO Tim Cook told analysts that shipping devices sold in the U.S. from India and Vietnam, rather than China, would add about $900 million to the company's costs for the June quarter in the company's earnings call earlier this month.Investors have been trying to figure out how much of an impact tariffs could have on Apple's top and bottom lines. UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a research note on Friday that ""if a 25% blanket tariff is applied to 70M annual iPhones imported into the U.S. from China and India, we estimate the annual EPS headwind would be $0.51."" Wall Street currently expects Apple to generate earnings of $7.18 in the current fiscal year.India is facing a potential 26% tariff on imports to the U.S., which has been suspended while trade talks take place, while levies on Chinese goods have been temporarily slashed to 30%.A few of Apple's key suppliers, such as chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, are expanding their U.S. operations under the threat of tariffs.However, its key manufacturing partner Foxconn — formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry — looks unlikely to follow suit, having already sharply scaled back plans for a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin which was announced in 2017. Foxconn said in a filing on Monday that it would invest $1.49 billion in its India unit.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tim Cook to Donald Trump: You Were Serious About That? — Barrons.com,1748030880000,"By Ben RoseAbout the author: Ben Rose is president of Battle Road Research, an independent equity-research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook's response to President Donald Trump's made-in-America push calls to mind a scene in the movie My Cousin Vinny. Vincent Gambini (played by Joe Pesci), a novice defense attorney, is scolded by Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) for showing up in his Alabama courtroom without a suit and tie, with the judge taking particular offense to Gambini's long leather jacket. When Gambini returns to the courtroom for his next appearance he is dressed the same way, but this time the judge holds in him contempt of court. Gambini, in disbelief, says to the judge: ""You were serious about that?""While Apple was entirely — some might say miraculously — spared from tariffs during Trump's first term, the president has vowed that now ""no one gets off the hook,"" not even America's most valuable company by market capitalization. And this time, he is serious. Apple will need to move some of its production to the U.S.During the first Trump administration, many U.S. companies that manufactured their products in China faced a 25% tariff. Some companies responded by moving production to other low-labor-cost countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to avoid the tariff penalty. Even though it had received an exemption, Apple, no doubt mindful of the growing tension between Washington and Beijing, began to move a portion of its iPhone production to India, in an effort to diversify its supply chain and manufacturing.At the start of the president's second term, companies were unsure whether the president's goal was to negotiate better trade deals, reduce reliance on China, or move more manufacturing back to the U.S. This time around, Apple wasn't going to take any chances. Just 35 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Apple unveiled plans to invest $500 billion (with a b) in the U.S. over the next four years to construct new manufacturing facilities, AI data centers, create 20,000 new jobs, and establish a manufacturing academy focused on workforce training.Having taken public steps to satisfy the president's wishes, Apple's executives likely breathed a further sigh of relief when U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on April 13 that computers and semiconductors would receive a 90-day reprieve from the president's scorching level of 145% tariffs on goods from China. Apple and others would be subject to a separate set of tariffs to be determined at a future date. Perhaps calculating that Trump's ultimate goal was simply to move manufacturing out of China, Apple announced a significant expansion of its production operations in India, presumably with the view that the president would not mind where its iPhones are made — so long as they are not made in China.But like Vincent Gambini, Tim Cook is learning the hard way that the president is serious about Apple making its products in the U. S. — ASAP — rather than potentially taking its sweet time by further expanding production in India.The pushback from Apple and others is that labor rates in the U.S. will make their products uncompetitive in the U.S., with some suggesting American-manufactured iPhones would cost U.S. consumers as much as $3,500.Apple is at least partially right, since labor costs in China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region are a fraction of what they would be in the U.S. In addition, Apple has invested billions of dollars in China, and has nurtured a reliable supply chain that meets its rigorous quality standards. Moving production to India or the U.S. is likely to result not only in higher costs, but a reduction in product quality. As a practical matter, not all of the components in Apple's products are made in America. So what is a practical solution to this standoff?Back to Vincent Gambini and Judge Haller. Following the judge's order, Gambini shells out the money to buy a brand new suit and tie, and thus satisfy the judge's edict to look ""lawyerly"" while defending his clients in the judge's courtroom. Apple's response might be to shell out the money to build or lease final assembly facilities in the U.S., while utilizing at least some amount of U.S.-based content, as well as contract manufacturers. It could also outsource prototyping, production, and bridge manufacturing to local companies that would welcome the work. In doing so, Apple would save a bundle on transportation costs from the Asia Pacific region, while at the same time demonstrate a good faith effort to more rapidly increase manufacturing and high tech jobs in the U.S. Otherwise, like Gambini and the judge, it will find out just how serious Trump was all along.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Trump's Tariff Threat Just Shattered the Bond Market -- Is Stagflation Back?,1748029511000,"The bond market just blinkedand it wasn't a small twitch. President Trump's latest tariff threats, including a proposed 50% hit on EU goods and a 25% levy on certain Apple NASDAQ:AAPL products, jolted short-term yields lower on Friday. The 2-year dropped to 3.90%its lowest since early Maywhile traders rushed to price in a scenario with two potential Fed rate cuts by year-end. But that short-end optimism is masking a bigger concern simmering under the surface.BlackRock's Russell Brownback called it straight: The curve has evolved into a stagflationary outcome. Translation? Investors are bracing for the double whammy of sluggish growth and stubborn inflationexactly the type of environment that could tie the Fed's hands. The 30-year yield briefly fell to 4.97% before snapping back to 5.04%, yet it now sits a full percentage point above the 5-yeara gap we haven't seen this wide in more than three years. JPMorgan's NYSE:JPM Jamie Dimon echoed the anxiety earlier this week, warning that stagflation isn't off the table given the toxic mix of geopolitics, deficits, and price pressures.And here's the kicker: America's fiscal credibility is cracking. The House just greenlit a tax bill expected to balloon the deficit by $3.8 trillion. Moody's reacted by stripping the U.S. of its last AAA credit rating. Investors, spooked by future borrowing needs, are demanding more compensation to hold long-term debtthe 10-year term premium is now nearing 1%, a level last seen in 2014. For now, Brownback suggests staying in the front and belly of the curvewhere you still catch decent yield, minus the long-end volatility that's about to get a lot messier.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:cd463e309094b:0-trump-s-tariff-threat-just-shattered-the-bond-market-is-stagflation-back/
Apple (AAPL) Faces Trump Tariff Threat Over Overseas iPhone Production,1748029412000,"President Donald Trump on Friday warned Apple (AAPL, Financials) it must manufacture iPhones in the United States or face a 25% tariff on imports, escalating tensions over the company's production shift to India.Apple could see steep cost increases if forced to reshore production. Trump's comments followed recent meetings with CEO Tim Cook, where he objected to Apple's plans to manufacture U.S.-bound iPhones in India.Apple reported that roughly 90% of iPhones are still produced in China despite ongoing diversification efforts. The company warned investors it could incur $900 million in tariff-related costs this quarter alone, driven by shifting production from China to India.According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, moving even 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S. would cost $30 billion and take at least three years. Fully reshoring could require five to ten years and push iPhone prices to around $3,500 per unit due to high domestic labor and infrastructure costs.Trump's broader tariff plan includes a 10% universal tariff and a reduced 30% tariff on most Chinese goods, down from 145% earlier in the month. Electronics, including iPhones, were previously exempt from higher tariffs, but Apple's India plans appear to have reignited Trump's ire.Apple has committed $500 billion to U.S.-based initiatives in 2025, including a server facility in Houston and expanded data center capacity to support its AI product suite, Apple Intelligence. Despite this, large-scale chip manufacturing remains dependent on Asian supply chains, although some Apple chips are now being produced at a TSMC plant in Arizona.Analysts say reshoring is logistically unfeasible. Wedbush reiterated that full domestic production is a fairy tale, noting the complexity of replicating Asia's supply ecosystem.Investors should monitor potential pricing changes in Apple's next iPhone release this fall and watch for any formal tariff implementation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6c644746f094b:0-apple-aapl-faces-trump-tariff-threat-over-overseas-iphone-production/

Apple's Stock Still Not Pricing in Trump's Demands - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1748023200000,"By Dan GallagherWhat do you do when the most powerful person in the world demands the impossible? If you're an Apple shareholder, you better settle in for a long, uncomfortable haul.Apple's share price took another tumble on Friday, after President Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on any iPhone made overseas. This is part of his push to have all iPhones sold in the U.S. made there as well. The stock has been on a mostly downward slope since Apple's disappointing earnings report on May 1 and has put the company's market value below that of Microsoft and Nvidia.That's far from a worst-case scenario. Apple's share price Friday morning represented a multiple of about 26 times projected earnings for the next four quarters. That's nearly in line with the company's five year average, according to FactSet data.That means more downside is possible-even for a stock now off 22% so far this year. If Trump's demands stick, Apple will likely simply pay the 25% tariff on its iPhones made in India and pass at least some of those costs on to its customers. That would be a far more palatable option than trying to move its massive, Asia-based supply chain to the U.S., which would take many years and hundreds of billions of dollars in a best-case scenario.But paying the additional tariffs has its downside as well. In a report earlier this month, Edison Lee of Jefferies said every percentage point increase in tariffs above ""current assumptions"" translates into a 1.5% impact on Apple's pre-tax profits this year.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

Last month, when asked by a reporter if Trump wants iPhones to be made domestically, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: ""Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.""Wall Street analysts, however, generally believe domestic iPhone manufacturing isn't tenable on a financial basis. The company relies on the contract manufacturer Foxconn to make the vast majority of its iPhones in China.

A ""targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,"" Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has said Apple can move new launches to a two-year schedule from annually. That would to help simplify the supply chain by extending the timeline on expensive manufacturing changes.Of course, Apple can decide to fight Trump and pressure him to revoke an iPhone tariff.

The GF Value at $208.90 also suggests shares may be undervalued at current levels. The bullish target of $300 implies strong upside potential, though the low estimate of $141 signals caution.

U.S. Stock Futures Plunge on Trump Tariff Concerns,1748012160000,"Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed.

Pre-Markets Drop Hard on New Trump Tariff Talk,1748010600000,"Friday, May 23, 2025Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation. See you next week.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump Threatens At Least 25% Tariffs on Apple's iPhones Made Outside US,1748010562000,"President Donald Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. This follows Trump's remark from last week that he had asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing in India. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their (iPhones) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""Apple shares fell 2.4% in Friday trading. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a Friday note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives estimate that manufacturing iPhones domestically could raise their price to about $3,500, adding that it would take five to 10 years to shift production to the US. During a quarterly earnings call at the beginning of this month, Cook said he expected the majority of iPhones sold in the US to have India as their source country for the ongoing three-month period, and China to be the country of origin for a ""vast majority"" of product sales outside the US. Cook's comments came as the US and China raised duties on each other's goods. However, Washington and Beijing recently agreed on a 90-day suspension of tariffs. ""We believe (Apple) will continue to navigate this complex tariff situation in a game of negotiations especially heading into iPhone 17 production this fall,"" Ives said Friday. Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on Apple's stock with a $270 price target. Apple in February announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years, including for an artificial intelligence server factory in Texas.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384708:0/
Cramer is worried about Apple: here’s why,1747935537000,"Famed investor Jim Cramer reveals he is worried about Apple, a stock that he has owned for more than a decade. Cramer is worried that Apple is losing easy revenue through regulatory tussles, geopolitical pressure, and OpenAI’s latest move. Apple in April lost its crown as the most valuable company in the world, with its market capitalisation declining beneath Microsoft.Nvidia also raced past the iPhone maker’s valuation as Apple is now trading as the third most valuable company with a $3 trillion valuation. In its Q2 results, the company’s earnings beat estimates, though iPhone sales plunged 10%. On Thursday, Apple shares were down 0.13%, and the stock is down 17% in the year so far.Losing easy moneyCramer points out that the first big problem for Apple is losing $20 billion from Google due to the antitrust case against Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Alphabet reportedly pays Apple $20 billion annually to make sure Google is the default search engine on iPhone and iPad. In the US antitrust case against Google for its monopoly in the search engine market.While Cramer said Apple could make the money by other methods, like charging other search platforms, the “Alphabet deal was $1 a share in easy profits that could go away”, he said.Legal strugglesApple’s legal case with Fortnite maker Epic Games is another area of concern for Cramer. Apple’s battle with Epic Games over app store payments could cause another 30-cent departure in the company’s earnings per share, Cramer noted. Recently, a federal judge slammed Apple over non-compliance with opening up its app store to alternative payment methods. The judge had ruled that the Cupertino-based company stop charging commissions on payments made outside Apple’s payment system. Apple charges a 30% commission on payments made on its App Store.The Fortnite game is now available on the Apple store, five years after Apple kicked it out. Trump factorApple’s plans to diversify its production from China to India is also facing a potential roadblock with US President Donald Trump wanting more. Trump recently criticised Apple’s decision to build in India. Trump wants Apple to manufacture in the US, which would cause a 13 times increase in manufacturing costs. The move would reduce Apple’s margins from its flagship product from $450 to just $60 if prices are not raised. Cramer flags this also as a problem, as making iPhones in the US could erode “one of the great American triumphs to rival smartphone maker Samsung, a Korean company”, he said.He says that without Trump’s blessing lot of havoc would happen against Apple. The host of CNBC’s Mad Money also said the US regulators are looking into Apple’s recent deal with Alibaba.Cramer said this partnership was the best source of new business for Apple in China. He adds that these deals, which were once seen as an American strength, are now viewed as US weakness and a boost for China.OpenAI threatOpenAI’s recent acquisition of a startup founded by former Apple design chief is also a concern for Cramer. OpenAI’s bid to make AI-enabled hardware is a question mark over Apple, according to Kramer. He adds that while he is not worried about long-term prospects, he says he won’t buy anymore stock in the current juncture.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:a7c04b149094b:0-cramer-is-worried-about-apple-here-s-why/
"Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on the EU, Stoking Fresh Trade Tensions — Barrons.com",1748010540000,"By George Glover and Reshma KapadiaPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would impose a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1 and threatened 25% tariffs on Apple iPhones if they weren't made in the U.S., reminding the market that the trade war is still very much on.Trump announced the levies in a post on Truth Social, citing the EU's ""powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies.""He said that he was ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the trading bloc, to take effect June 1. The duties won't apply to any products that are manufactured in the U.S., Trump added.Europe's flagship Stoxx 600 index plummeted after Trump said he would impose the levies. It was down 1.8% at last check. Paris's CAC 40 tumbled 2.8% and Frankfurt's Dax dropped 2.3%. U.S. stocks also fell.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and the European Commissioner For Trade Maroš efčovič are set to speak on a call later on Friday. The European Commission's spokesperson on trade declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment about Trump's Truth Social post.The latest threats come as trade talks have dragged out on multiple fronts and analysts like Owen Tedford at Beacon Policy Advisors has worried that Trump could look to make an example of a token country to pressure other priority countries to commit to some sort of framework agreement faster.""The EU is particularly problematic for the Trump administration because they are not caving to pressure,"" says Henrietta Treyz, head of research at political consultancy Veda Partners. The two sides aren't closer to a resolution on longstanding issues, including standards for agriculture and commodity purchases and a digital services tax.The escalation is similar to the approach the administration tried with China and then walked back with its recent pause. ""He has created an untenable tariff that effectively bans trade between the two nations,"" says Treyz, who expects tariffs on EU to rise, probably to 20% to 30%. ""By threatening 50% today, should he land at 20% or even 30%, it's possible the market sees that as 'de-escalation' and doesn't respond as negatively to the shock.""""Dialing tariffs up or down is one way the administration believes it can bring forth change in global supply chains and trade,"" says Juhi Dhawan, a macro strategist for Wellington Management via email, who expects the tariffs to be a tool used throughout the Trump presidency.The takeaway for investors: The relative calm around trade may have been misplaced. In a client note this morning, Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that container traffic hasn't rebounded after the 90-day pause and roll back on U.S.-China tariffs, a sign that the uncertainty is still paralyzing trade.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump Just Threatened Apple With a 25% Tariff -- Here's What Could Happen Next,1748008801000,"Donald Trump just fired a shot across Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL bow and markets flinched. In a fiery Truth Social post on Friday, the former U.S. President warned that if iPhones sold in America aren't made on American soil, Apple could be hit with a 25% tariff. Trump claimed he had already told Tim Cook to stop shifting production to India and ""anyplace else,"" suggesting a potential policy reversal if he's reelected.Investors didn't take it lightly. Apple stock sank 3.4% in the premarket trading at 7.49am, dragging Nasdaq (QQQ) futures into the red. The sell-off highlights just how sensitive markets remain to tariff talk especially when it comes to tech giants with deep global supply chains. Despite Apple's multi-billion-dollar U.S. investment pledges, the company still relies heavily on China and has recently ramped up iPhone manufacturing in India a strategic hedge that now faces political headwinds.Apple hasn't commented yet, but the message from Trump is loud and clear: bring jobs back or pay the price. A 25% tariff would hit Apple's margins or force it to pass costs to consumers neither of which would sit well with shareholders. For now, this is just talk. But with the 2024 race heating up and reshoring back in the spotlight, Apple investors may want to start scenario planning.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:17ef80ced094b:0-trump-just-threatened-apple-with-a-25-tariff-here-s-what-could-happen-next/

Apple Shares Fall on Trump Threat: 'Make iPhones in U.S. or Pay 25%',1748008471000,"May 23 - Apple NASDAQ:AAPL shares dropped by as much as 4% in early Friday trading after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured domestically.The comments, posted on Trump's Truth Social platform, targeted Apple's offshore production strategy. He said iPhones sold in the U.S. should be built within the country. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S., he wrote.The post comes amid reports that Apple's key supplier, Foxconn (FXCOF), plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new facility in Tamil Nadu, India. The plant will reportedly produce display modules for Apple, part of the tech giant's ongoing efforts to diversify its supply chain beyond China.Apple has steadily expanded manufacturing operations to countries including India, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Trump's remarks added pressure on the stock, which weighed on Nasdaq futures, down about 0.4% during early trade.Market watchers said the tariff talk introduces fresh uncertainty for Apple, especially as it ramps up investment in Asia.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:1de91d9d6094b:0-apple-shares-fall-on-trump-threat-make-iphones-in-u-s-or-pay-25/

Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.,1748007840000,"By Britney NguyenPresident Donald Trump said Apple must pay a 25% tariff if it doesn't rely on domestic production of iPhones for the U.S. marketShares of Apple Inc. were down more than 2% shortly after Friday's open after President Donald Trump threatened the company with a tariff if it doesn't make iPhones for the U.S. market stateside. One analyst called Trump's dream of domestic iPhone production a ""fairy tale.""""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) that I expect their [iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""However, analysts at Evercore ISI said in April they didn't see iPhone production moving into the U.S., ""as the higher labor costs alone would drive a >50% increase in iPhone manufacturing costs"" - double the tariff Trump is now threatening to put on Apple.""This implies that even under a 50% global baseline tariff it would not make financial sense to produce the iPhone domestically,"" Evercore said last month.Earlier this month, the president said he ""had a little problem"" with the Apple chief during a meeting between the two in Qatar. Trump has taken issue with the iPhone maker's further expansion into India. Apple doesn't produce any smartphones in the U.S., but has been diversifying its supply chain away from China since pandemic-era lockdowns and as geopolitical tensions between the two countries have intensified. The company has moved production into countries including India and Vietnam, but the Trump administration is still pushing for the company to bring its manufacturing stateside.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.As Trump floated massive tariffs on goods imported from China earlier this year, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, pointed out that most of the components used in iPhones are made abroad.""If U.S. tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come,"" Ives said in an April note. An iPhone made in the U.S. could cost $3,500, Ives said - more than double the current $1,000 price tag.Ives reiterated his point in a note on Friday, saying that building iPhones in the U.S. ""would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of $3,500 if it was made in the US.""He estimated that shifting production to the U.S. would take between five to 10 years, and called the idea ""a fairy tale that is not feasible.""In April, analysts at Gimme Credit said moving some iPhone production to the U.S. ""cannot be done immediately.""""It would take meaningful time and money to build and develop the physical infrastructure,"" the analysts said. ""More importantly, it is doubtful that the U.S. could provide the necessary labor force, both in terms of quality and quantity.""The analysts noted that Apple would likely still have to import some components from China.India produced about 20% of Apple's iPhones - or more than 40 million devices - in the past year ending in March, according to Bloomberg. The company is now focused on sourcing most of its iPhones sold in the U.S. from India by the end of 2026, the report said.-Britney NguyenThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

European stocks fall as Trump proposes 50% tariff on EU imports; says talks with them ‘going nowhere’,1748007559000,"President Donald Trump on Friday said he is recommending a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in trade talks with the 27-nation bloc. The proposed tariffs would take effect on June 1 and mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Washington and Brussels.Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “The EU has been very difficult to deal with…our discussions with them are going nowhere!” The announcement came less than 30 minutes after Trump threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones if the company does not begin manufacturing them within the United States.The dual threats reflect Trump’s increasingly aggressive trade posture as his administration races to strike deals before existing global tariff agreements expire in July. Source: Truth SocialBrussels awaits scheduled call between EU and US trade representativesThe European Commission declined immediate comment, saying it would await the outcome of a scheduled call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, set for 15:00 GMT. The call is expected to be tense, as Greer reportedly plans to inform Sefcovic that recent EU proposals fall well short of US expectations.The timing of Trump’s announcement surprised many in Brussels. Just weeks earlier, the US had agreed to a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs, offering both sides time to negotiate. That truce was meant to stabilize markets following Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcement on April 2, which had already roiled investors by introducing a 20% tariff later revised down to 10%.Currently, EU exports to the US are only subject to the new “baseline” tariff. A shift to 50% duties would represent a dramatic departure and potentially provoke retaliatory measures from Europe.Market reaction swift and negativeThe financial fallout from Trump’s statement was immediate. European stocks fell sharply, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.9%. Germany’s DAX dropped 2.3%, France’s CAC 40 fell 2.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 lost 1.3%.Sectors most vulnerable to global trade volatility were hit hardest. Banking stocks sold off heavily, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale losing 6% and 5.5% respectively. Italian lender Unicredit was down 4.2%. The regional Stoxx Banks index slumped 3.6% as investors assessed the indirect risks to lenders from a potential economic downturn triggered by tariffs.Consumer cyclical and luxury goods sectors were also under pressure. Swatch Group and Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica were each down about 5%.Bond markets, a typical haven during uncertainty, saw increased demand. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell 8 basis points to 2.56%, while yields on French, Italian, and Swiss bonds also declined.Bond yields move inversely to prices, meaning investors were moving money into safer assets.Economists warn of stagflation risksCommenting on the potential consequences of such high tariffs, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said, Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box , Goolsbee warned the tariffs could create a “stagflationary” scenario by increasing production costs and slowing output, all while raising consumer prices. “That’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” he added.The EU was the second-largest buyer of US goods in 2022, importing nearly $351 billion worth of American products. A 50% tariff could severely impact transatlantic trade flows and unsettle multinational corporations relying on open trade channels.Trump’s broader strategy remains unclearThe Trump administration is currently in talks with over a dozen governments in an effort to renegotiate trade deals before automatic tariff resets take effect in early July. However, several foreign officials have expressed concern over Washington’s unpredictable demands, noting the difficulty in making concessions when tariffs can be reimposed without warning.Trump has long argued that European nations benefit disproportionately from trade with the United States. His push for “reciprocal” tariffs seeks to align duty rates, though critics say such measures risk igniting full-blown trade wars and undermining global supply chains.With less than two weeks remaining until the proposed 50% tariff would take effect, attention now turns to upcoming discussions between US and EU trade officials. A failure to find common ground could deepen the rift between two of the world’s largest economic blocs.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:5bb71649d094b:0-european-stocks-fall-as-trump-proposes-50-tariff-on-eu-imports-says-talks-with-them-going-nowhere/
"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H.

"Apple Will Continue to Balance Politics, Business While Preparing for iPhone 17 Launch, Wedbush Says",1748007155000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL will continue balancing politics and business as it prepares for the launch of iPhone 17 later this year despite push from US government to produce gadgets locally, Wedbush said in a note Friday. Following Foxconn's recent announcement to invest $1.5 billion in a new iPhone production facility in India, US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would impose a 25% tariff on Apple if the company continues producing iPhones outside the US, especially in India, according to the note. Trump stated he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically, the investment firm said. Despite Apple's $500 billion investment in US-based AI projects, analysts say it is unrealistic to shift iPhone manufacturing to the US soon due to high costs and logistical challenges, Wedbush said. Experts estimate that making iPhones in the US would drive retail prices to around $3,500, making the plan financially unworkable, Wedbush analysts noted. During Apple's March earnings call, Cook revealed over 50% of US-bound iPhones are now made in India, and this could increase to 60%-65% by fall, Wedbush noted.

House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities. As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February. Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:747eff640094b:0-stock-market-news-for-may-22-2025/

OpenAI acquires Jony Ive’s AI startup io in landmark $6.5B deal: should Apple be concerned?,1747892436000,"OpenAI will acquire io, the secretive artificial intelligence hardware startup co-founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, in a landmark all-stock transaction valued at nearly $6.5 billion. The move is OpenAI’s most significant acquisition to date and signals a determined push into developing physical consumer devices powered by AI.The purchase gives OpenAI access not only to io’s team of around 55 engineers and designers but also to the creative vision of Ive, the British-born designer behind Apple’s most iconic products including the iPhone, iPod, and MacBook Air. The acquisition also formalises a relationship that has been in the making for nearly two years, as Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have quietly explored new device ideas together.“I have a growing sense that everything I’ve learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place and to this moment,” Ive said in a joint interview with Altman.

The team, now under OpenAI’s umbrella, will focus on building what Altman and Ive describe as “a family of devices” for the age of artificial general intelligence.The duo did not share specifics about the hardware under development but indicated that the first product would not simply be an iteration of the smartphone or laptop, but an entirely new computing form factor designed to complement AI’s growing capabilities. “People have an appetite for something new,” Ive said, hinting at user fatigue with current devices.Altman added, “AI is such a big leap forward in terms of what people can do that it needs a new kind of computing form factor to get the maximum potential out of it.”The first device from the collaboration is slated for release in 2026.Who is Jony Ive?Once described by Steve Jobs as his “spiritual partner”, Jony Ive’s return to the heart of consumer technology marks a significant comeback for one of the most influential designers of the modern era. The British-born designer spent decades at Apple, where he worked closely with Steve Jobs to shape products that would define a generation, including the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple Watch. Ive left Apple in 2019 after a storied tenure, having played a central role in establishing the visual and tactile language of today’s smartphones and personal devices.Sam Altman@sama·Followhttps://twitter.com/sama/status/1925242282523103408thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.Watch on TwitterView replies10:58 pm · 21 May 2025https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy0ReplyCopy linkRead more on TwitterAt the time of his departure, Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that Ive and the company would continue to collaborate, but no joint products ever materialized. After leaving Apple, Ive founded the design firm LoveFrom, a creative collective composed of former Apple colleagues and longtime collaborators. In 2023, he co-founded the startup io with Apple veterans Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan — each with deep experience in the company’s hardware ecosystem. Acquisition brings ex-Apple hardware veterans to OpenAIThe acquisition also brings into OpenAI’s fold a collection of ex-Apple hardware veterans who followed Ive after his departure from the tech giant in 2019.Among them are Scott Cannon, co-creator of the Mailbox app; Evans Hankey, Ive’s successor at Apple; and Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch product design until 2024.At io, the team had been developing devices suited for a future defined by artificial general intelligence—where machines achieve human-like cognitive abilities. That mission now becomes part of OpenAI’s strategy as it seeks to embed intelligence not just in software but across the physical world.The hardware ambitions are supported by other investors including Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective, Thrive Capital, Maverick Capital, and SV Angel. OpenAI confirmed that Altman holds no personal equity in io.Apple shares fall amid concerns over AI leadershipNews of the acquisition sent Apple shares down as much as 2.3% on Wednesday, as the market absorbed the implications of its former star designer now leading the charge at one of its AI rivals. Apple has been seen as lagging behind in artificial intelligence, with its recently introduced AI platform partly dependent on OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Analysts say the move could accelerate Apple’s perceived decline in AI leadership and product innovation. “Jobs would be damn proud,” Altman said of the new venture, praising Ive’s creative legacy and calling their collaboration a “rare opportunity.”Though the move poses potential competition for Apple, Altman and Ive were careful to note that their project does not aim to replace the smartphone. “In the same way that the smartphone didn’t make the laptop go away, I don’t think our first thing is going to make the smartphone go away,” Altman said.Building AI’s physical futureOpenAI’s push into consumer hardware arrives as competition in AI intensifies. The company, currently valued at $300 billion, is racing to keep pace with rivals including Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI. All are investing aggressively and rapidly launching new AI models and features.To support its expansion, OpenAI has bolstered its hardware and robotics expertise. In November, it hired Caitlin “CK” Kalinowski, the former head of Meta’s Orion augmented reality glasses project, to lead its consumer hardware and robotics efforts. Kalinowski said the goal was to “unlock AI’s benefits for humanity” through physical products.In a separate effort, OpenAI also invested in San Francisco-based robotics startup Physical Intelligence, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion valuation. That company is working to integrate general-purpose AI into the physical world through robots powered by large-scale algorithms. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is also an investor in the startup.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:675680911094b:0-openai-acquires-jony-ive-s-ai-startup-io-in-landmark-6-5b-deal-should-apple-be-concerned/

Apple has been the worst Big Tech stock lately. Here's why investors are missing the big picture.,1748089800000,"By Laila MaidanApple's stock has sold off on tariff fears, but the company has a healthy business underpinned by a sticky ecosystem and robust array of services offeringsOne thing Apple users can agree on is that it's hard to imagine trading an iPhone or a MacBook for a Samsung smartphone or a Lenovo laptop. That's probably the biggest thing Apple has going for it amid the tariff noise.Yet Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) has been under pressure lately. As large technology stocks have roared back in May, Apple shares have missed out. The stock is down 8% so far this month. It's the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that's in the red over that period, according to FactSet data. It's also the worst-performing stock of the bunch on a year-to-date basis, down 22%.Friday's tariff-related scare added to the pain. Apple's stock closed 3% lower to clinch its eighth loss in a row.Don't miss: Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.But even as President Donald Trump threatened Apple on Friday with a 25% tariff if it didn't bring its manufacturing into the U.S., analysts aren't flinching and don't think investors should either. But that point comes with a caveat that's like a pilot telling passengers they're about to experience some turbulence. That's true, too, of Apple's stock. The short-term ride might be unpleasant, but arrival is still on time. So, if you're already invested, it's probably not a good idea to get off midflight.That said, over a three- to five-year timeframe, there's a lot of reason to be confident in the company's growth prospects because the products are part of an admirably sticky ecosystem, according to Gil Luria, the head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. His view is that the services tacked on to Apple's hardware products will keep customers coming back. It's also true that many who buy one Apple product, like an iPhone, tend to buy another, like a MacBook, Luria noted. In short, the recent stock weakness isn't a statement on the health of the business. It's more of a relationship issue between Trump and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.""If you get to a point where the president is posting in such a confrontational manner, that means the negotiation isn't going well,"" said Luria.It's a setback, but it's not bad enough to send Luria back to his model to rework his outlook for the company. While an additional 25% tariff would hurt the company's profitability, he believes there's still a chance that negotiations between Apple and the White House could stave off the worst. If Apple products did take an additional 25% tariff hit, that would hurt earnings in the nearer term. However, the costs could be spread out by partially raising prices and passing some costs along to parts suppliers, Luria said. Additionally, Apple wouldn't be at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as Trump noted that Samsung (KR:005930) and other makers of smartphones would also be slapped with 25% tariffs on devices made overseas as they're imported to the U.S.Ask the Moneyist: Is now a good time to buy an iPhone?Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, chuckled and called the tariff threat ""noise,"" adding that it doesn't impact how he views Apple. ""I don't think you can take too much away from these headlines,"" he said. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that Cook's relationship with the president isn't as strong as it may once have been, he noted. Under the first Trump administration, Cook was able to secure a tariff exemption.Valuationwise, Apple's stock is trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, below its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. But Apple could see the slowest sales growth among the group, with a two-year estimated compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.1% through 2026. What that all means, said Luria, is that, despite slowed sales, investors still have a lot of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Apple's stock trades at a premium compared with the S&P 500 SPX, which has a forward P/E of 21.2 and a two-year estimated sales CAGR slightly above Apple's at 5.6%. Meanwhile, Apple's forward P/E is slightly below that for the S&P 500 information-technology sector, which stands at 26.8. Yet the IT sector has a two-year sales CAGR more than double Apple's, at 11.3%.Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, says Apple's bigger problem is that Siri's integration with Apple Intelligence has fallen behand. The company is at risk of losing market share to any contender able to release life-changing generative AI services. That's something Mortonson believes could happen through Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pixel phones or through Google's partnership with Samsung Galaxy and the integration of generative AI into that smartphone.That risk means he wouldn't suggest investors be overweight the stock, and he believes a stock like Alphabet is a better bet given its cheaper forward P/E at 17.3 with a two-year estimated sales CAGR double Apple's, at 10.7%.The next important event for Apple will be its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 9. The company will have a chance to wow customers with any updates, particularly on Apple Intelligence. But until then, Luria believes, he said, that investors should suspend judgment about the stock.Overall, investing is based on an individual's risk tolerance. While Apple is still seen as a solid company, and a good stock to own, there may be better risk-reward opportunities elsewhere. As for investors who already own the stock because they like the company and believe in the business's long-term prospects, panic selling based on negative headlines is never a good strategy. Instead, investors should focus on the company's key drivers. And a big one right now is how well Apple can compete in generative AI services because that will help drive hardware sales and increase demand for Apple's services segment, including cloud storage.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"“No chance” iPhones can be made in the US, analysts say — options Apple could explore instead to tackle tariffs",1748073600000,"Apple is staring down a major supply chain and pricing dilemma after President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the United States unless the tech giant begins manufacturing the devices domestically. Trump’s remarks, posted on Truth Social and reiterated later to reporters at the White House, are the latest escalation in his push for US-based production by large multinationals.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote, warning that otherwise “a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.”The president’s comments come as Apple has been ramping up production in India, seeking to diversify away from its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing amid rising geopolitical tensions and pandemic-era disruptions. CEO Tim Cook recently said more iPhones sold in the US would be made in India, a shift that may now be politically fraught.Analysts say iPhone making in the US unfeasible; say threat a negotiation tacticApple shares dropped almost 3% on Friday trading following Trump’s post, falling to $195.44. The prospect of steep tariffs raised concerns across financial markets, with analysts warning of significant cost implications and logistical hurdles should Apple try to comply.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimated that manufacturing iPhones in the US could push retail prices to $3,500, a dramatic increase from today’s average $1,000. “We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,” Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Morningstar analyst William Kerwin echoed those sentiments, describing domestic iPhone manufacturing as unfeasible in the medium term. “To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater US investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone,” he said.Potential strategies for Apple under tariff threatFaced with this new pressure, Apple may explore various strategies to blunt the impact of a potential tariff hike.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring suggested that Apple could cut less profitable models from its iPhone lineup, focusing instead on higher-margin units to reduce the blow. A “targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,” Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.Another option floated by analysts involves stretching the product release cycle. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple could switch from an annual to a biennial launch schedule, simplifying supply chains and production timelines.Apple may also decide to confront the administration directly, publicly tying higher prices to Trump’s trade stance. One proposal discussed in analyst circles is for Apple to add a “tariff surcharge” to each US sales receipt, making consumers aware of how much more they’re paying because of the new tariffs.Constraints that limit Apple’s US productionFor now, most analysts agree that relocating iPhone production to the US is impractical. Apple’s manufacturing relies heavily on China-based partner Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers and taps into a dense web of suppliers, logistics firms, and engineers—none of which are easily replicable in the US.“The idea of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said, adding that even if the company decided to pursue the move, it would take five to ten years to make it a reality.The challenges are not new. In 2011, when President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the US, Jobs reportedly replied, “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” referring to Asia’s unmatched industrial infrastructure and labour scale.Some of Apple’s suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, are expanding US operations under pressure. However, Foxconn appears unlikely to significantly boost its American footprint. The firm scaled back a highly publicized $10 billion Wisconsin plant and has instead committed $1.49 billion to its India operations.Likely bearing of 25% tariff on Apple’s earningsUBS analyst David Vogt estimated that if a 25% tariff were applied to 70 million iPhones annually imported from China and India, Apple’s earnings per share could take a hit of about $0.51. Wall Street currently expects Apple to earn $7.18 per share this fiscal year.As pressure mounts from Washington, Apple is left navigating a volatile mix of political demands, economic realities, and consumer expectations. Whether Trump’s threat is a hard policy shift or a negotiation tactic, it has already forced a reckoning over the limits of globalization and the fragility of tech supply chains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:669d8abeb094b:0-no-chance-iphones-can-be-made-in-the-us-analysts-say-options-apple-could-explore-instead-to-tackle-tariffs/
'Tariff Man' Is in a Bad Mood Ahead of the Memorial Day Weekend — Barrons.com,1748004300000,"By Martin BaccardaxJust when you thought it was safe to go back into the water.Stocks haven't had a great run this week and were on pace for their biggest five-day slide since the ""Liberation Day"" lows in early April. But with the S&P 500 just 5% from its all-time peak, Nvidia earnings just around the corner, and the bond market settling from its recent tantrum, you could make a solid case for optimism heading into the Memorial Day weekend.And then it happened.President Donald Trump, fresh from hosting a controversial dinner for well-heeled meme coin investors last night at his Mar-a-Lago residence, took to his social-media platform and fired off two messages that touched on his go-to theme: tariffs.Likely reacting to a report that Apple was looking to expand its India-based supply chain, Trump warned the tech giant would face a 25% levy if the iPhones it sells in the U.S. aren't made in the U.S.Trump, who in 2018 said he was a 'Tariff Man,"" followed that missive with a threat to impose a ""straight 50%"" tariff on imports from the European Union, citing what he has long claimed are unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, and the targeting of American companies by the region's competition authorities.Markets reacted in kind, taking a sleepy pre-long weekend premarket into another roiling tariff casino, with futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 now suggesting a near 100-point slump for the benchmark.The market's benchmark volatility gauge, the CBOE Group's VIX index, surged more than 15% to 24.09 in the wake of the president's remarks, suggesting traders are now expecting daily swings of 1.5%, or 88 points, for the S&P 500, a 37.5% increase from earlier this week.The merits of the president's case are, for the most part, besides the point at this stage, and markets have largely stopped debating the veracity of his claims or the impact that his threats might have on growth prospects in the world's biggest economy.What they can't ignore, however, is the impact they're likely to have on corporate profits, be it in terms of Apple's bottom line or that of the myriad U.S. companies that rely on overseas sales to drive overall earnings.They also can't discount the fact that corporate leaders, try as they might, aren't able to insulate their companies from this tariff-theme wroth.Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many others, donated to the president's inauguration fund and attended the event in Washington, sitting near to Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Chairman Jeff Bezos, and unveiled a massive $500 billion U.S. investment plan in late February.It hardly seems to matter now.Apple stock was down 3.1% in premarket trading, a pace that would drag one of the world's most valuable companies deeper into bear market territory.Investors, meanwhile, will be left hanging into the early spring holiday, with the S&P 500 at risk of losing a big chunk of its hard-fought May gains as another round of tariff angst, alongside recession worries, inflation pressures, and a bond market freakout adding to the rising wall of worry.For a man who enjoys a round of golf as much as he does, Trump sure knows how to ruin a good Memorial Day weekend.Write to Martin Baccardax at martin.baccardax@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

What Sam Altman Told OpenAI About the Secret Device He's Making With Jony Ive — WSJ,1747882740000,"Berber JinOpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave his staff a preview Wednesday of the devices he is developing to build with former Apple designer Jony Ive, laying out plans to ship 100 million AI ""companions"" that he hopes will become a part of everyday life.Altman told employees that they had ""the chance to do the biggest thing we've ever done as a company here,"" he said after announcing OpenAI's plans to purchase Ive's startup, named io, and give him an expansive creative and design role. He suggested the $6.5 billion acquisition has the potential to add $1 trillion in value to OpenAI, according to a recording reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.In the meeting, Ive noted how closely he worked with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs before his passing in 2011. With Altman, ""the way that we clicked, and the way that we've been able to work together, has been profound for me.""Altman and Ive offered a few hints at the secret project they have been working on. The product will be capable of being fully aware of a user's surroundings and life, will be unobtrusive, able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the device won't be a phone, and that Ive and Altman's intent is to help wean users off of screens. Altman said the device also isn't a pair of glasses, and that Ive had been skeptical about building something to wear on the body.Ive referenced ""a new design movement."" Altman said it would amount to a ""family of devices,"" bringing up his fondness for how Apple has long integrated its hardware and software offerings.Altman told OpenAI staff that stealth will be important for their ultimate success to avoid competitors copying the product before it's ready.For months, Ive's team has been speaking with vendors who will be able to ship the device at scale. ""We're not going to ship 100 million devices literally on day one,"" Altman said, predicting that OpenAI would ship that large quantity of high-quality devices ""faster than any company has ever shipped 100 million of something new before."" Altman said the goal is to release a device by late next year.The grandiose plans echo Altman's bold vision for OpenAI's expansion in many spheres, including for data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars, enterprise technology, chatbots, personal robots and beyond.Rolling out new devices, especially ones that will compete with deep-pocketed, multitrillion-dollar companies like Apple or Google, has long been among the most difficult of challenges in the tech industry. Humane, another startup made up of former Apple executives that Altman invested in, sold an ""Ai Pin"" that failed to catch on with consumers.And OpenAI is already bleeding cash. The startup told investors last fall it won't generate a profit until 2029, and it expects to lose $44 billion before doing so, the Journal has reported.While Apple and Google have struggled to keep pace with AI innovations, many investors see the two companies — whose software runs nearly all the world's smartphones — as the primary means through which billions of people will access AI tools and chatbots. Building a device is the only way OpenAI and other artificial-intelligence companies will be able to interact with consumers directly.Altman and Ive also offered details about how their collaboration grew in the last several years. Eighteen months ago, OpenAI's Vice President of Product Peter Welinder began working with Ive's team. The two sides became excited about a specific device last fall.The original plan was for Ive's startup to build and sell its own device using OpenAI's technology, but Altman said he eventually realized that wouldn't work. Altman said he knew the two companies would have to be combined because the device wasn't just an accessory but a central facet of the user relationship with OpenAI.""We both got excited about the idea that, if you subscribed to ChatGPT, we should just mail you new computers, and you should use those,"" Altman said.Altman said he and Ive came to believe that existing devices wouldn't work. While ChatGPT changed people's expectations about the power of technology, it is still being used in an old paradigm: holding a laptop, launching a website, and typing something in and waiting.""It is not the sci-fi dream of what AI could do to enable you in all the ways that I think the models are capable of,"" Altman said.Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521011770:0/
Tim Cook's Bad Year Keeps Getting Worse — WSJ,1748052000000,"By Rolfe WinklerFor Tim Cook, the hits keep coming.On Friday, President Trump targeted Apple with new demands that the company make iPhones in the U.S., threatening 25% tariffs if the company doesn't comply. ""Rise and shine Tim Cook,"" Trump whisperer Laura Loomer posted on X, reminding the Apple CEO he is at the center of the president's trade bull's-eye.That is just one of the threats Cook has confronted in what has appeared to be a no good, very bad year for Apple. Aside from Trump, Cook is facing off against two U.S. judges, European and worldwide regulators, state and federal lawmakers, and even a creator of the iPhone, to say nothing of the cast of rivals outrunning Apple in artificial intelligence.Each is a threat to Apple's hefty profit margins, long the company's trademark and the reason investors drove its valuation above $3 trillion before any other company. Shareholders are still Cook's most important constituency. The stock's 25% fall from its peak shows their concern about whether he — or anyone — can navigate the choppy 2025 waters.What can be said for Apple is that the company is patient, and that has often paid off in the past.This past week, a key architect of the iPhone, Jony Ive, joined OpenAI to develop a next-generation device that weans consumers off screens. After he announced a deal to sell his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported that a key goal is to deliver an AI-powered device that shifts the current computing paradigm in which humans stare at black rectangles all day. Later, OpenAI told employees it is aiming to make 100 million AI ""companion"" devices.It is hard to gauge the potential for a brand-new computing device from a company that has never made one. Yet the fact that it is coming from the man who led design of the iPhone and other hit Apple products means it can't be dismissed. Apple sees the threat coming: ""You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as that sounds,"" an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified in a court case this month.Apple isn't expected to show any AI breakthroughs at its annual developer conference in a couple of weeks. And Cook said on Apple's recent earnings call that a more personalized Siri assistant hasn't arrived yet because what the company has in the shop doesn't yet meet Apple's ""high quality bar.""The company might not need to be first in AI. It didn't make the first music player, smartphone or tablet. It waited, and then conquered each market with the best. A question is whether a strategy that has been successful in devices will work for AI.Apple makes billions in revenue from its services business, carrying gross profit margins north of 70%, compared with less than 40% for hardware. A judge wrote in a recent ruling that Apple ignored her injunction to allow app developers to bypass its steep fees on app store purchases. ""Cook chose poorly"" in listening to advice to ignore her, she wrote. European Union regulators want Apple to make similar changes abroad, and worldwide regulators could follow suit.State and federal lawmakers are threatening the app store with legislation to require Apple to verify user ages. While the bottom-line impact of such a move is unclear, it could reduce teen spending or even empower parents to limit teen engagement on smartphones more fully.Meanwhile, the judge overseeing an antitrust case against Alphabet's Google could demand that the search giant stop paying Apple some $20 billion annually to be the default search engine in Safari, revenue that is basically pure profit for Apple.Of course, all of these issues pale next to threats to Cook's greatest creation — Apple's supply chain in China.Trump's demands notwithstanding, there isn't much Apple can do to move iPhone production, which remains centered in China. While it is shifting final assembly of more iPhones to India, many of the components inside the device still come from across the Himalayas.The strategy gives Apple some flexibility to arbitrage different tariffs for U.S.-bound devices assembled in the two countries.Trump wants a made-in-America iPhone. Such a device could cost over $3,000, so he is unlikely to get one.Cook might try to placate him by shifting production of something else to the U.S., and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent may have given Cook an out on iPhones when he said Friday that the administration wants Apple to make more of its chips here.Apple already announced plans to facilitate production of AI servers in Texas, but Trump clearly expects more. With frequent calls to the White House and a meeting there in the past week, Cook, it seems, is negotiating his next peace offering.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009759:0/
"Treasury Yields, Dollar Fall Amid New Tariff Threats — Market Talk",1748004000000,"Treasury yields and the dollar fall as Trump threatens a 50% tariff on the E.U. starting June 1 and a 25% tariff on imported iPhones. Yields and the dollar were going down overnight and briefly changed direction after the tweets, while remaining below yesterday levels. In a nod to the fiscal concerns that rocked markets this week, Deutsche Bank's George Saravelos writes that the challenge around Trump's trade policies is that the U.S. deficit ""requires ongoing funding from foreigners to be sustained."" There is no major data point on tap ahead of Memorial Day. The 10-year yield is at 4.485% and the two-year at 3.929%. The WSJ Dollar Index falls 0.6%.

Markets Slide on Bond Option; Q1 Earnings After the Close,1747864740000,"Wednesday, May 21, 2025A couple things happened mid-day that sent a steady flat-to-down session falling into the red and staying there. Market indexes closed off their lows, but appeared to be trending back down in the final minutes before the close. The Dow slip -816 points, -1.91%, the S&P 500 -95, -1.61%, the Nasdaq -270, -1.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 -55 points, -2.63%.One occurrence was a sell-off in bonds, likely having something to do with the U.S. government planning to add to the overall deficit with a major tax cut bill working its way through Congress. The three credit rating agencies have already downgraded the U.S. from AAA, and now this bond option has led to spiking Treasury yields: +4.59% on the 10-year, +4.01% on the 2-year, and back up over +5% on the 30-year bond.The other event was more localized in the realm of AI and concerning the original designer of the iPhone, Jony Ive. Ive’s AI startup io is going to Sam Altman’s OpenAI for a cool $6.4 billion, and without many details the market priced in a discount at Apple AAPL, which closed -2.3% on the day. What this move signals in a broader sense, however, is that access to AI design and implementation is becoming increasingly competitive.Q1 Earnings After the Close: URBN, SNOW, ZMUrban Outfitters URBN posted solid beats on its Q1 report after today’s closing bell, with earnings of $1.16 per share easily outperforming the 81 cents expected. Revenues of $1.33 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks consensus of $1.29 billion. Comps rose +4.8% year over year, led by Anthropologie. Company subscribers rose by nearly +60%. The retailer made no mention of tariff impacts on future gains. Shares are up +9% after hours. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Data storage firm Snowflake SNOW also outpaced estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with earnings of 24 cents per share beating expectations by 2 cents on quarterly sales of $1.04 billion, which improved over the $1.00 billion analysts were anticipating. Product revenue guidance was placed much higher for Q2: $997 million versus $962 million previously expected. Shares gained +7% on the news in late trading.Zoom Communications ZM makes it 3-for-3 following Wednesday’s close: earnings of $1.43 per share “zoomed” past the Zacks consensus $1.30, with revenues eking out a slight beat: $1.17 billion versus $1.16 billion. Earnings guidance was lifted while revenues were kept in-line, as gains in Enterprise outperformed estimates. The videoconferencing services firm had jumped higher on the news, but have moderated somewhat.What to Expect from the Stock Market ThursdayFinally, tomorrow morning we see some economic reportage, including Weekly Jobless Claims, S&P flash Services and Manufacturing PMI, and Existing Home Sales. Expectations are for jobless claims to remain steady at the slightly higher levels we’ve seen over the past few weeks, lower PMI results with Services remaining above the 50 threshold but Manufacturing dipping below it, and home sales coming in slightly higher month over month.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. ""The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,"" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523000097:0/
Trump threatens Apple with 25% tariffs over foreign iPhone production; shares fall,1748003211000,"Apple’s decision to expand its manufacturing footprint in India has triggered a sharp response from US President Donald Trump, who warned on Friday that iPhones sold in the United States must be made domestically—or face heavy tariffs. The warning marks a new escalation in Trump’s global tariff strategy, directly targeting one of the world’s most valuable companies.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”The move marks Trump’s first direct trade threat against a single company, setting a precedent for potential future action against other multinationals who rely heavily on overseas production.Apple shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading after the post, dragging down broader market sentiment.Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped by 112 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures both declined by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Source: Truth SocialTrump’s warning follows report about Foxconn’s $1.5bn plant in IndiaThe president’s statement comes on the heels of reports about Apple’s key supplier, Foxconn’s plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new component plant near Chennai, India, further entrenching the country’s position in Apple’s global supply chain. According to a Financial Times report, the plant will assemble iPhone display modules, which play a vital role in the touchscreen interface and visual quality of the device.Two Indian government officials told FT that the facility, located in Tamil Nadu’s Oragadam industrial region, has already received clearance from local authorities. It is expected to create around 14,000 jobs and become one of the largest electronics-sector investments in the country.Foxconn disclosed the investment via a filing on the London Stock Exchange this week, noting that the funds will be routed through its Indian subsidiary, Yuzhan Technology India.Currently, Apple manufactures around 85% of its iPhones in China, with India accounting for roughly 15%. The company has been slowly increasing its Indian production share, partly to diversify its supply chain away from China amid rising geopolitical risks and to leverage India’s more favourable trade ties with the United States.Escalation of frustrationTrump’s threat follows a more measured statement he made last week on the same issueAt an event in Qatar last week, Trump revealed that he had directly confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company’s growing operations in India, despite its pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said. “I told him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.”He accused Apple of taking advantage of preferential treatment in the US while concentrating its manufacturing overseas, especially in China. “We’ve treated you really good,” he said. “Now you got to build for us.”The high costs of Apple’s US manufacturingDespite political pressure, shifting iPhone assembly to the United States remains economically challenging. Industry analysts estimate that relocating production would cause labour costs to skyrocket—from $290 per month per worker in India to about $2,900 under US wage laws. This would increase the cost of assembling each device from around $30 to $390.Such a move could slash Apple’s profit per iPhone from $450 to just $60 unless the company raises its prices. Some estimates suggest that building the devices entirely in the US could push the retail price to nearly $3,000—three times the current price point.This cost disparity has long been a key reason for Apple’s international production strategy. While India offers relatively lower costs and improving infrastructure, bringing manufacturing stateside would be financially unsustainable without a significant increase in retail prices or a dramatic reduction in margins.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:87ff0993a094b:0-trump-threatens-apple-with-25-tariffs-over-foreign-iphone-production-shares-fall/

Dow logs worst day in a month. Here are the reasons driving the rout.,1747859820000,"By Isabel WangThe yield on the 30-year Treasury bond hovers at its highest level since Oct. 25, 2023The stock market's selloff picked up steam on Wednesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its steepest daily decline in a month.The blue-chip index DJIA tumbled over 800 points, or 1.9%, to end at 41,860.44, while the S&P 500 SPX close 1.6% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP slumped 1.4%, according to FactSet data.The Dow's biggest drag was shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc., (UNH) which fell 5.8% after HSBC cut its rating on the stock to reduce, a month after downgrading it to hold. The bank also slashed its stock-price target to $270 from $490, with the new target implying about 12% downside from current levels.Consumer stocks also came under pressure on Wednesday.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/

Stocks tally worst session in a month as weak bond-market auction has investors wondering how U.S. will manage its debt,1747858620000,"By Joseph Adinolfi and Joy WiltermuthWorries about rising bond yields are coming home to roost, sending the Dow down 800 pointsInvestors have been warily eyeing rising Treasury yields since the start of May, with some fretting that the latest jump in borrowing costs could soon start hurting stocks.Those fears were realized on Wednesday, as a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields climbing to fresh highs. Borrowing costs tied to long-dated debt touched levels not seen since late 2023.That sent stocks reeling, with major indexes tallying their worst session since April 21, Dow Jones Market Data showed.""Looks like we are sinking,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said after the weak 20-year bond auction.The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was knocking on the door of the 4.6% level, and concerns about tariffs and ""the battle of the budget"" remain, he said.Republicans are working to pass President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill. The latest version of the legislation included tax and spending cuts but would do little to pare the U.S. budget deficit.""When you have yields jumping up like this, it's a tough crosscurrent for stocks,"" Cardillo said.Stocks had shaken off some of their early losses heading into the afternoon, as gains for Big Tech names like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into the green.But around 1 p.m., the market suffered a one-two punch. Reports that OpenAI would buy an artificial-intelligence company founded by former Apple Inc. (AAPL) design chief Jony Ive appeared to weigh on shares of Ive's former employer.Around the same time, the weak 20-year BX:TMUBMUSD20Y auction helped revive concerns about waning foreign demand for U.S. debt. Suddenly, investors were starting to question how the U.S. would manage its debt burden over the long term.This, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy, was enough to weigh on stocks, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Management.See: Why the next 20-year Treasury auction is 'must-see TV' for investors after the Moody's downgrade""It's a question of how much growth are we going to get, and what is the revenue stream for the U.S. government looking like to support the debt that they're issuing,"" he said.Mulberry also pointed out that pain in debt markets was a global phenomenon on Wednesday, as yields on bonds trading in Japan and Europe also spiked.Earlier, investors digested weak earnings from Target Corp. (TGT), along with a report from fellow retailer TJX Cos. (TJX), the parent of TJ Maxx, which Mulberry described as not as bad as Target's, but still not great. Shares of both companies were selling off.Meanwhile, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) fell further, heaping more pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was also weakening, signaling that the ""Sell America"" trade might be back on, at least for now. Meanwhile, gold (GC00) and bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed, with the latter hitting a fresh record high north of $109,000 per coin.The S&P 500 SPX finished 95.85 points, or 1.6%, lower at 5,844.61, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 270.07 points, or 1.4%, at 18,872.64.

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

OpenAI's $6.5B Power Move: Jony Ive Is Back to Reinvent the Future of Tech,1747855900000,"OpenAI just made its boldest move yet: a $6.5 billion all-stock acquisition of io, the stealth AI hardware startup co-founded by Jony Ive, the man behind the iPhone. It's not just a talent grabit's a statement. With this deal, OpenAI now controls a 55-person elite unit of former Apple NASDAQ:AAPL engineers, designers, and manufacturing veterans, all handpicked by Ive. The goal? Build a new class of AI-powered devices from scratch. Altman called it a crazy, ambitious thing to make. Investors should be paying attention.The collaboration has been brewing behind the scenes for nearly two years. Ive says it feels like everything he's done so far was just preparation for this. Altman? He thinks Steve Jobs would be damn proud. While the duo won't reveal what the product is, they're confident it won't kill the smartphonebut could challenge its role. Their first device is expected to launch in 2026, and early comments suggest it won't look like anything on the market today. If successful, this could redefine how we interact with AImoving beyond screens and into something more intuitive, more human.Apple may not say it out loud, but this has to sting. Ive was once described as Jobs' spiritual partner. Now he's building the next big thingwith someone else.

Tim Cook Called Texas Governor to Stop Online Child-Safety Legislation — WSJ,1748036400000,"By Rolfe Winkler, Amrith Ramkumar and Meghan BobrowskyApple stepped up efforts in recent weeks to fight Texas legislation that would require the iPhone-maker to verify ages of device users, even drafting Chief Executive Tim Cook into the fight.The CEO called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week to ask for changes to the legislation or, failing that, for a veto, according to people familiar with the call. These people said that the conversation was cordial and that it made clear the extent of Apple's interest in stopping the bill.Abbott has yet to say whether he will sign it, though it passed the Texas legislature with veto-proof majorities.In the weeks leading up to its passage, Apple hired more lobbyists to pressure lawmakers. An interest group it funds targeted the Austin, Texas, area with ads saying the legislation is ""backed by porn websites."" Google also finances the interest group and is fighting the legislation. The law's supporters say adult-content sellers don't favor it.Texas would be the largest state to adopt what is called an app-store accountability law. Similar laws have been proposed across at least nine states and adopted in one, Utah. Federal legislation also has been introduced. Meta Platforms — along with social-media companies X and Snap — also have played a role in the lobbying fight, advocating that what is known as ""age-gating"" should be the responsibility of app stores rather than individual apps.The Texas bill is turning heads because its success in the second-biggest state with a Republican legislature could foreshadow adoption across the country, potentially creating new costs for Apple and Google, as well as for some app makers.The law requires those running app stores, primarily Apple and Google, to verify the age of a device owner. If the owner is a minor, their app-store account would have to be tied to a parent's account. The parent would be notified when their child wants to download an app and have to approve or deny the download.Proponents argue that such laws will give parents more control over their children's use of smartphones, and that children aren't legally allowed to agree to apps' terms of service in the first place.Critics say such a law could impose costs on a swath of apps whose content isn't controversial. They also say the bills are allowing Meta and other apps to shunt responsibility for online safety onto others.One reason the laws are being crafted to have app stores verify ages, and not individual apps that are viewed as problematic, is that the latter approach would likely be struck down on free speech grounds, say those who have helped shepherd the bills.Meta has 13 lobbyists working in Texas, according to the state's Ethics Commission. Apple has six and Google has seven.An Apple spokesman said that the company wants to strengthen online safety for children but that the Texas bill threatens user privacy. ""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" he said.Meta has said that verifying ages at the app store-level is easier and helps preserve privacy, by only having children's ages stored in one place instead of on every app they access.A spokesman for Abbott said ""safety and online privacy for Texas children remains a priority for Governor Abbott. The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk.""The age-verification bills are the latest threat to Apple's lucrative apps business. Last month, a judge forced the company to allow app developers to avoid Apple's steep commissions on app-store sales, a move the European Union is also pushing for.It is also the latest sign that Cook is playing a personal role lobbying for the company. When it comes to tariffs, he is known to call President Trump directly to advocate for the company's position. He was spotted visiting the White House on Tuesday.

"Trump Threatens Fresh Tariffs on EU, iPhones and Rival Devices — WSJ",1748034900000,"By Gavin Bade, Meridith McGraw and Rolfe WinklerWASHINGTON — President Trump fired new salvos in the global trade war on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on imported goods from the European Union and new duties on iPhones and other smartphones made overseas.Trump said the EU had been ""very difficult to deal with"" on trade in a Friday morning social-media post. Less than a half hour earlier, he threatened Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, with a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones made overseas.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" he wrote on Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.Later on Friday, in Oval Office comments, Trump said those tariffs will include ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair."" Trump appeared to be referring to companies that manufacture smartphones outside of the U.S. He added that the tariffs would likely be imposed in late June.The threats build on the president's effort to pressure CEOs to move more manufacturing to America and punish allies whose trade policies the White House argues are unfair. Cook met with Trump at the White House this week, according to a White House official.The White House didn't immediately provide additional comment. Apple declined to comment. An EU representative declined to comment. Apple shares declined 3% on Friday.Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU imports, which was later paused for 90 days to allow for negotiations. A 10% baseline levy remains, and some specific EU products, like cars, are subject to higher tariff rates.The U.S. president has long criticized European nations on trade, and he said in his Friday morning social-media post that trade discussions with the bloc had made little progress. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!"" he wrote. He said the 50% tariff would go into effect on June. 1.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he is ""not looking for a deal."" Minutes later, he said the EU likely wants an agreement to avoid the tariffs, and added, ""We're going to see what happens, but right now it's going on on June 1."" Trump listed Europe's nontariff barriers, regulations and lawsuits against U.S. firms as prime irritants driving his threat.European officials had expressed cautious optimism in recent days that talks were progressing after the two sides exchanged documents outlining some of the trade issues they are seeking to discuss. However, they acknowledged they remain far apart in their positions.The EU has been unwilling to move on some of Trump's demands, particularly the value-added tax, which the administration views as an unfair trade practice, but EU Economy Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said the tax is off the table in negotiations. This week, Dombrovskis needled the Trump team at a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting by saying their trade deals would be a ""suboptimal"" outcome for the global economy and suggesting that U.S. allies had to compromise with the U.S. on trade language in a joint statement.EU Trade Commissioner Maroš efčovič spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, hours after Trump's initial threat. In a social-media post after the call, he said the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, but added that trade between the U.S. and EU ""must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.""""We stand ready to defend our interests,"" he added.During the meeting of finance ministers in Canada this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told EU officials they have a ""collective action problem,"" warning that progress on reaching a trade deal with Europe had slowed because each nation has different priorities for an agreement, according to a U.S. official.Bessent on Friday hit out at Europe again, saying on Fox News that ""with the exception of the EU, most [nations] are negotiating in good faith.""Last week, Trump chided Cook for Apple's plans to shift final assembly for many U.S.-bound devices to India, and he reiterated his demands that the company bring manufacturing back to America. He called the CEO his ""friend,"" but suggested that Apple's plan to invest some $500 billion in America wasn't enough.Bernard Arnault, CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, this week urged European lawmakers to take a more pragmatic, deal-focused approach to trade negotiations with the U.S.""The United States is the No. 1 market in the world,"" Arnault told French senators during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. ""It's very important for Europe to reach an agreement with the United States. As of now, it seems to me things are off to a bad start.""Arnault, who first met Trump when the two men were real-estate developers in New York in the 1980s, also warned against adopting a confrontational tone.""If we threaten him — if we say, for example, 'We're coming in and we're going to take this or that measure,' or, 'We no longer want our companies to invest in the United States' — we'll get the opposite result,"" Arnault said.After Trump raised tariffs on goods made in China, Apple accelerated its effort to make most U.S.-bound iPhones in India. Such a move would allow it to claim India as the ""country of origin"" and pay the lower duties facing that nation.Bessent, in his Friday interview with Fox, said the administration is trying to persuade Apple to build semiconductors in the U.S.""I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities...is this external production, especially in semiconductors. A large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors,"" Bessent said. ""We would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Bessent said he met with Cook this week.Technology experts have said that while shifting some iPhone manufacturing to America is possible, building the full stack of iPhone components and assembling it in the U.S. would be challenging and costly. IPhones contain a patchwork of sophisticated parts, sourced from many countries and put together primarily in China. America doesn't have facilities that resemble the infrastructure developed in China, nor does it have skilled manpower to assemble iPhones at that scale.Apple shares declined slightly more than the market, but not to an extent that indicates investor concern that the company would be subject to the 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones. ""The market is obviously concluding that this is just a negotiation,"" said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.He said he expects the eventual outcome for Apple will be for the company to make some additional components in the U.S., but not iPhones themselves.Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com, Meridith McGraw at Meridith.McGraw@WSJ.com and Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523004234:0/

Former Apple Design Guru Jony Ive to Take Expansive Role at OpenAI — WSJ,1747849620000,"By Keach Hagey and Berber JinJony Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and his design firm are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, where they will develop consumer devices and other projects that will shape the future look and feel of AI.OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, have been working on a new device that will move consumers beyond screens, according to people familiar with the matter. They have been collaborating for two years on a closely guarded project, considering options including headphones and other devices with cameras, the people said.The partnership between Ive, a visionary designer, and OpenAI, which has transformed how consumers seek information, could herald a new era of AI-powered consumer technology. It puts a seasoned designer at the creative helm of a fast-growing startup that aims to one day have a hand in everything from devices to AI-powered robots, AI models with humanlike intelligence and a global network of data centers.The former Apple employee's work at OpenAI will extend across all the company's ventures, from future versions of ChatGPT to audio features, its app and other products, according to people familiar with the matter.London-born Ive left Apple in 2019 to found LoveFrom, a design firm that has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb and the luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. Ive also leads io, a company founded last year to design and develop a new family of AI-powered products.As part of an unusual deal announced Wednesday, OpenAI will also acquire io in an all-equity deal that values it at $6.5 billion. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in the company late last year, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI's startup fund also invested at the time.The acquisition of the rest of Ive's io puts an executive who helped change the relationship between consumers and technology at the forefront of development of devices that move consumers away from screens.Io's staff of roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI, while LoveFrom continues to operate independently.OpenAI will be a customer of LoveFrom and LoveFrom will receive a stake in OpenAI, people familiar with the matter said. The companies expect the transaction to close this summer pending regulatory approval.""I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this moment,"" Ive said. Altman said he hopes the team can ""bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit that I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago.""Ive and Altman said in a joint statement that their work together grew out of friendship and collaboration.Altman has taken a number of steps to explore device and hardware options, investing in 2020 in the startup Humane, which launched what it called the Ai Pin with OpenAI's technology that failed to catch on with consumers.Altman has long been fond of Apple and was eager to strike a deal with the iPhone-maker when the company sought partnerships for the rollout of Apple Intelligence about a year ago. He has idolized Apple co-founder Steve Jobs even though Altman has been outspoken in his criticism of smartphones and what he sees as toxic aspects of screen addiction.OpenAI's acquisition of io points to its growing ambitions as a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, who's tasked with helping the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.While much of Ive's work at Apple revolved around the specific look and feel of products in the physical world, he also took greater responsibility for software issues on certain devices toward the end of his tenure there.Write to Keach Hagey at Keach.Hagey@wsj.com and Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521008183:0/
Wall Street Declines After Trump's Fresh Tariff Threats; Apple Falls 3%,1748033993000,"US benchmark equity indexes declined on Friday as President Donald Trump's tariff threats against the European Union and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL refueled concerns about a trade war. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1% at 18,737.2. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% to 5,802.8, marking the fourth straight day of declines, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6% to 41,603.1. Among sectors, technology saw the biggest drop, while utilities paced the gainers. The three benchmarks are down more than 2% each this week. US markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Trump recommended a 50% tariff rate on the EU, effective June 1, saying that talks with the bloc had stalled. The announcement has ""reignited"" concerns about a transatlantic trade war, ING Bank said. Separately, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares declined 3%. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a client note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""""Today's announced threat may be a goad to European leaders to negotiate more quickly with the US,"" Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report. ""In any case, the news reiterates our cautious guidance of recent weeks, namely, that new tariffs (and, as today, threats of tariffs) remain material risks to financial markets, especially when the announcements come as surprises.""US Treasury yields were lower, with the 10-year rate decreasing 4.4 basis points to 4.51% and the two-year rate losing nearly one basis point to 3.99%. Deckers Outdoor NYSE:DECK shares sank 20%, the worst performer on the S&P 500. The footwear and apparel company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday.

KeyBanc lowered its rating on Deckers' stock to sector weight from overweight. Workday NASDAQ:WDAY shares slumped nearly 13% on Friday, the second biggest drop on the S&P 500.

Intuit NASDAQ:INTU was the best performer on the S&P 500, up 8.1%. The financial technology platform late Thursday posted fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded the Street's estimates. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 0.7% at $61.63 a barrel. For the week, WTI crude futures were expected to report a modest decline.

"Stocks Fall on Tariff Broadside, After Week of Bond Market Agita — WSJ",1748032860000,"By Matt WirzThe markets started the week with fears of a deficit crisis and ended with renewed angst over tariffs.President Trump renewed his tariff campaign Friday, threatening to impose a 50% rate on the European Union and warning Apple that foreign-made iPhones could face significant levies. Shares of Apple lost 3%, while broader stock indexes finished the day lower by 0.6% to 1%. The S&P 500 index ended the week down 2.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite both fell 2.5%.""I'm not so worried about the stock action,"" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management. ""A 2% to 3% drop is just normal trading compared to what investors have gotten used to in the last couple of months.""More worrying is the steady rise in Treasury bond yields since Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. government and the House of Representatives passed a tax bill that could add to the country's large budget deficit.The 30-year Treasury bond yield finished the week at 5.036%, its highest level since 2023, while the 10-year yield ended the week at 4.508%, about the same as its high point during the worst of the market turmoil in April. Bond yields rise when prices fall. In contrast, the S&P 500 is still about 16% above its lowest point in April.Stock investors are relatively sanguine because ""they now know that Trump will pivot on trade,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, referring to the president's softer stance since late April. Stock prices would have dropped far more dramatically had Trump made his comments about Europe in March, he said. ""The market has finally figured out not to overreact to every salvo.""Still, the fresh tariff threats from the White House are aimed at core pillars of global commerce: one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. European stocks fell about 0.9% and investors sought shelter in haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, weighing on the dollar. Gold prices rallied.Senior U.S. and EU trade officials held a prearranged call on Friday, with neither side changing its position significantly in comments afterward. G-7 finance and central bank chiefs issued a vague statement Thursday that made no mention of levies, and only one mention of ""trade, "" after a summit that featured both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and EU representation.On Apple, Trump said in a Friday post that he has told Apple CEO Tim Cook ""that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.""Elevated Treasury bond yields indicate that traders are also worried that diminishing demand for U.S. government bonds will increase the country's borrowing costs. That would bring knock-on effects on large and small businesses by raising the cost of corporate loans and slowing economic activity.In another cause for concern, the value of the dollar is dropping even as bond-yields rise. That could indicate the U.S. currency is losing some of its appeal as a haven for foreign savers and corporations.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523008752:0/

Dividend Watch: 2 Red-Hot Stocks Boosting Payouts,1747840500000,"Everybody loves dividends, as they provide a passive income stream, limit drawdowns in other positions, and provide more than one way to profit from an investment.And when considering dividend-paying stocks, those with a history of boosting their payout are prime considerations, reflecting their commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.In addition, consistent dividend hikes reflect the company’s successful nature, opting to share profits with shareholders.For those seeking companies that have recently boosted payouts, Apple AAPL and Vistra VST fit the criteria. Let’s take a closer look at each.Apple Keeps Generating CashApple’s latest set of quarterly results came with several positives, including record Services revenue and record EPS for its March quarter. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year throughout the above-mentioned period, with adjusted EPS of $1.65 up 8% from the same period last year.The company’s stellar cash-generating abilities have allowed it to reward shareholders nicely, with the tech titan announcing a 4% boost to its quarterly dividend payout. Apple also unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting even more of its cash to work.The tech titan generated $20.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.Due to its heavy manufacturing exposure in China, the recent de-escalation of trade tensions is a massive positive. Apple previously warned it may pass the higher costs onto consumers through iPhone price hikes, so the recent news is excellent for both parties.Shares jumped on the news, gaining nearly 20% since the announcement.Vistra Increases Payout AgainVistra safely operates a reliable, efficient, power generation fleet of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Shares have been scorching hot over the last year, gaining nearly 70% thanks to demand stemming from the AI infrastructure buildout.The company announced a 3% increase to its quarterly payout, continuing a trend of higher payouts over the years. VST presently sports a 13% five-year annualized dividend growth rate, with its payout ratio sitting sustainably at 12% of its earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s dividends paid on a quarterly basis.Importantly, Vistra reaffirmed its current year guidance in its latest release in early May, providing a big sigh of relief to investors. The Q1 earnings cycle has largely been dictated by commentary for the upcoming periods, and VST cleared the critical hurdle.Bottom LineDividends bring many great perks to investors, such as passive income and the ability to achieve maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.Companies typically boost payouts when business is running smoothly, overall sending a positive message concerning the longer-term picture as well. In addition, consistently higher payouts owe to a company’s cash-generating abilities, undoubtedly a huge positive.And for those seeking companies looking to pay their shareholders a higher paycheck, both companies above – Apple AAPL and Vistra VST – fit the criteria.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1ed91535c094b:0-dividend-watch-2-red-hot-stocks-boosting-payouts/

Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further.

Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Fortnite Returns to Apple's App Store in the U.S. — Update,1747839240000,"By Mauro Orru""Fortnite"" is back on Apple's App Store in the U.S. nearly five years after the iPhone maker removed the popular videogame amid a long-running dispute with developer Epic Games.Apple yanked ""Fortnite"" from its app store in August 2020 after Epic Games sought to introduce its own in-app payment system that bypassed a 30% commission that Apple charged on in-app transactions.Apple said it removed ""Fortnite"" because Epic's payments feature violated its policies, while Epic Games countered that Apple collected an unfair cut of revenue. The two companies have been locked in a legal back-and-forth ever since.In a post on X, Epic Games said late Tuesday that Fortnite was back on the App Store in the U.S. for iPhones and iPads, as well as the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union.The reinstatement of the game comes weeks after a federal judge said Apple had violated a 2021 ruling that required the iPhone maker to loosen its restrictions on how developers can seek payment within their apps.The judge, who issued a new order for the company to allow developers to steer users to alternate methods of paying for services or subscriptions offered in the App Store, also took the extraordinary step of referring the matter to federal prosecutors to determine whether criminal contempt proceedings are warranted.Apple said it would comply with that order, though it disagreed with the court's decision which it planned to appeal.Epic Games last week said Apple had blocked the ""Fortnite"" app it had submitted for review. Apple said it had asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to affect ""Fortnite"" in other geographies.On Monday, the same judge that presided over the 2021 case effectively demanded that Apple approve the reinstatement of ""Fortnite"" on the App Store or send a representative to court to prove it had a basis for not doing so, according to court records seen by The Wall Street Journal.Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on the reinstatement of ""Fortnite.""Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521006993:0-fortnite-returns-to-apple-s-app-store-in-the-u-s-update/
Apple Is Unlikely to Escape Tariffs This Time. Trump Is Doubling Down. — Barrons.com,1748031480000,"By Adam Clark and Angela PalumboApple stock was dropping on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the U.S.""I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump said in a post on social-media platform Truth Social early on Friday.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.The president doubled down on his post in a meeting at the White House on Friday, where he told reporters that not only would he put tariffs on Apple if they don't move production to the U.S., but he would also place levies on Samsung and other smartphone products makers who import to the country to ensure fairness. He added that those tariffs would potentially start at the end of June.""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs,'"" Trump added.While tariffs are paid by the importer of record at the time the goods enter the country, economists generally agree that the increased costs are passed on to suppliers and consumers.In an interview with Fox News Friday morning, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he thinks one of the country's ""greatest vulnerabilities is this external production, especially in semiconductors, and a large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors, so we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Apple shares fell 3% to $195.27 on Friday. The stock has now fallen 22% this year, compared to the 1.3% decline of the S&P 500. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Owen Tedford, an analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, says the Apple tariff threats could be tied to the levies expected out of the administration's Section 232 investigations into certain sectors.""It would suggest that Trump is at least considering not giving the company an exemption from the duties,"" Tedford said. Apple was exempted from tariffs during Trump's first term in office. ""It also implies that there is at least some consideration to cover electronics devices as part of the [Section 232] tariffs that were expected to primarily hit semiconductors.""These sector-oriented tariffs are expected to be stickier but the timing still isn't still clear, especially as the administration tries to strike trade agreements with various countries related to its April 2 blitz of tariffs.As companies and countries await trade decisions from the president, Apple has already started making changes. It's increasing production of iPhones in India in a bid to diversify its production in response to the tariffs Trump has imposed on China, previously the main hub for the company's smartphone production. Trump has publicly criticized the move, saying he had ""a little problem"" with Apple CEO Cook and calling on the company to build in the U.S. instead.The Wall Street Journal reported that Cook met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, citing a White House official. Apple has already committed to investing more than $500 billion and hiring around 20,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years, although it unclear how much of that sum is new.The threatened 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured overseas is still likely to be considerably less than the cost of producing 'made in USA' devices. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has estimated that making an iPhone in the U.S. would probably lead to a retail price of around $3,500 compared with around $1,000 currently, and it would take years to build the necessary production capacity.""We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,"" Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Ives isn't alone in this belief. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin wrote in a research note on Friday that he doesn't think iPhone production in the U.S. is ""feasible in the medium term.""""To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater U.S. investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone.""Among other electronics like semiconductors and personal computers, Apple's products are temporarily exempt from the hefty reciprocal tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. However, Apple recently said it's already taking a financial hit from tariffs. CEO Tim Cook told analysts that shipping devices sold in the U.S. from India and Vietnam, rather than China, would add about $900 million to the company's costs for the June quarter in the company's earnings call earlier this month.Investors have been trying to figure out how much of an impact tariffs could have on Apple's top and bottom lines. UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a research note on Friday that ""if a 25% blanket tariff is applied to 70M annual iPhones imported into the U.S. from China and India, we estimate the annual EPS headwind would be $0.51."" Wall Street currently expects Apple to generate earnings of $7.18 in the current fiscal year.India is facing a potential 26% tariff on imports to the U.S., which has been suspended while trade talks take place, while levies on Chinese goods have been temporarily slashed to 30%.A few of Apple's key suppliers, such as chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, are expanding their U.S. operations under the threat of tariffs.However, its key manufacturing partner Foxconn — formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry — looks unlikely to follow suit, having already sharply scaled back plans for a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin which was announced in 2017. Foxconn said in a filing on Monday that it would invest $1.49 billion in its India unit.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

On Friday, Wedbush analysts maintained their Outperform rating on the stock and raised their price target to $500 from $350.Intuit, the owner of TurboTax and Credit Karma, rose 8% after boosting its fiscal-year outlook following stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings and revenue.

Deckers said it expects earnings in the period of 62 cents to 67 cents a share, below consensus of 79 cents. The company also forecast first-quarter revenue that missed estimates.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet",1747832340000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India — and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company's prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Tim Cook to Donald Trump: You Were Serious About That? — Barrons.com,1748030880000,"By Ben RoseAbout the author: Ben Rose is president of Battle Road Research, an independent equity-research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook's response to President Donald Trump's made-in-America push calls to mind a scene in the movie My Cousin Vinny. Vincent Gambini (played by Joe Pesci), a novice defense attorney, is scolded by Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) for showing up in his Alabama courtroom without a suit and tie, with the judge taking particular offense to Gambini's long leather jacket. When Gambini returns to the courtroom for his next appearance he is dressed the same way, but this time the judge holds in him contempt of court. Gambini, in disbelief, says to the judge: ""You were serious about that?""While Apple was entirely — some might say miraculously — spared from tariffs during Trump's first term, the president has vowed that now ""no one gets off the hook,"" not even America's most valuable company by market capitalization. And this time, he is serious. Apple will need to move some of its production to the U.S.During the first Trump administration, many U.S. companies that manufactured their products in China faced a 25% tariff. Some companies responded by moving production to other low-labor-cost countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to avoid the tariff penalty. Even though it had received an exemption, Apple, no doubt mindful of the growing tension between Washington and Beijing, began to move a portion of its iPhone production to India, in an effort to diversify its supply chain and manufacturing.At the start of the president's second term, companies were unsure whether the president's goal was to negotiate better trade deals, reduce reliance on China, or move more manufacturing back to the U.S. This time around, Apple wasn't going to take any chances. Just 35 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Apple unveiled plans to invest $500 billion (with a b) in the U.S. over the next four years to construct new manufacturing facilities, AI data centers, create 20,000 new jobs, and establish a manufacturing academy focused on workforce training.Having taken public steps to satisfy the president's wishes, Apple's executives likely breathed a further sigh of relief when U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on April 13 that computers and semiconductors would receive a 90-day reprieve from the president's scorching level of 145% tariffs on goods from China. Apple and others would be subject to a separate set of tariffs to be determined at a future date. Perhaps calculating that Trump's ultimate goal was simply to move manufacturing out of China, Apple announced a significant expansion of its production operations in India, presumably with the view that the president would not mind where its iPhones are made — so long as they are not made in China.But like Vincent Gambini, Tim Cook is learning the hard way that the president is serious about Apple making its products in the U. S. — ASAP — rather than potentially taking its sweet time by further expanding production in India.The pushback from Apple and others is that labor rates in the U.S. will make their products uncompetitive in the U.S., with some suggesting American-manufactured iPhones would cost U.S. consumers as much as $3,500.Apple is at least partially right, since labor costs in China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region are a fraction of what they would be in the U.S. In addition, Apple has invested billions of dollars in China, and has nurtured a reliable supply chain that meets its rigorous quality standards. Moving production to India or the U.S. is likely to result not only in higher costs, but a reduction in product quality. As a practical matter, not all of the components in Apple's products are made in America. So what is a practical solution to this standoff?Back to Vincent Gambini and Judge Haller. Following the judge's order, Gambini shells out the money to buy a brand new suit and tie, and thus satisfy the judge's edict to look ""lawyerly"" while defending his clients in the judge's courtroom. Apple's response might be to shell out the money to build or lease final assembly facilities in the U.S., while utilizing at least some amount of U.S.-based content, as well as contract manufacturers. It could also outsource prototyping, production, and bridge manufacturing to local companies that would welcome the work. In doing so, Apple would save a bundle on transportation costs from the Asia Pacific region, while at the same time demonstrate a good faith effort to more rapidly increase manufacturing and high tech jobs in the U.S. Otherwise, like Gambini and the judge, it will find out just how serious Trump was all along.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

Google AI Advances Cheered by Wall Street.

While analysts were impressed, the stock market still seems worried about how AI might eat into the company's core search market.The headline announcements on Tuesday included the introduction of ""AI mode"" to Google's search engine for U.S. users and a premium AI subscription. That came alongside many features such as 3-D video calls, real-time language translation and digital assistants, as well as a new line of smart glasses.Alphabet shares were up 0.3% at $164.54 in premarket trading after falling 1.5% the previous day. However, Wall Street analysts said the event showcased the company's strength in AI development.The conference ""reoriented investors back to first principles, i.e., AI success requires a combination of engineering, infrastructure, and distribution, and Alphabet is well positioned across these areas,"" wrote KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson in a research note Wednesday.Patterson has an Overweight rating and $195 target price on Alphabet stock.Google said its ""AI Overviews"" feature has 1.5 billion monthly users and the evidence is that users shown such summaries subsequently use its search engine more frequently.""We believe these enhancements will resonate with users and attract advertisers through higher quality leads and improved monetization potential,"" wrote CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.That could help calm some fears about declining usage, triggered earlier this month when an Apple executive testified in a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google that searches in the iPhone maker's browsers fell for the first time in April.""Google is about to go through a tricky time as doubters call into question its search business, and there is a possibility that its shares get hit hard if the numbers wobble before getting back on track,"" wrote independent analyst Richard Windsor.

Trump's Tariff Threat Just Shattered the Bond Market -- Is Stagflation Back?,1748029511000,"The bond market just blinkedand it wasn't a small twitch. President Trump's latest tariff threats, including a proposed 50% hit on EU goods and a 25% levy on certain Apple NASDAQ:AAPL products, jolted short-term yields lower on Friday. The 2-year dropped to 3.90%its lowest since early Maywhile traders rushed to price in a scenario with two potential Fed rate cuts by year-end. But that short-end optimism is masking a bigger concern simmering under the surface.BlackRock's Russell Brownback called it straight: The curve has evolved into a stagflationary outcome. Translation? Investors are bracing for the double whammy of sluggish growth and stubborn inflationexactly the type of environment that could tie the Fed's hands. The 30-year yield briefly fell to 4.97% before snapping back to 5.04%, yet it now sits a full percentage point above the 5-yeara gap we haven't seen this wide in more than three years. JPMorgan's NYSE:JPM Jamie Dimon echoed the anxiety earlier this week, warning that stagflation isn't off the table given the toxic mix of geopolitics, deficits, and price pressures.And here's the kicker: America's fiscal credibility is cracking. The House just greenlit a tax bill expected to balloon the deficit by $3.8 trillion. Moody's reacted by stripping the U.S. of its last AAA credit rating. Investors, spooked by future borrowing needs, are demanding more compensation to hold long-term debtthe 10-year term premium is now nearing 1%, a level last seen in 2014. For now, Brownback suggests staying in the front and belly of the curvewhere you still catch decent yield, minus the long-end volatility that's about to get a lot messier.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:cd463e309094b:0-trump-s-tariff-threat-just-shattered-the-bond-market-is-stagflation-back/

Apple (AAPL) Sees iPhone Shipments Plunge Amid Tariff Escalation,1747777886000,"Apple (AAPL, Financials) saw iPhone shipments from China to the United States fall to their lowest level since 2011 in April, as trade tensions and tariff increases disrupted supply chains.Exports of Chinese smartphones to the U.S. dropped 72% year over year in April to under $700 million, according to Chinese customs data cited by Reuters. The broader decline in Chinese exports to the U.S. was 21% in the same period.The sharp fall followed a U.S. tariff increase on Chinese imports to 145%, which triggered a retaliatory move by Beijing imposing 125% duties. Although Washington and Beijing reached a temporary truce later in May, key disagreements remain unresolved, including U.S. sanctions on Huawei's AI chip production.The total U.S.-China trade volume stood at $690 billion in 2024. Smartphones, lithium-ion batteries, and laptops were among the top imports into the U.S. from China.India, Apple's main production base outside China, is playing a growing role in offsetting these losses. Shipments of iPhone components from China to India have nearly quadrupled over the past year. In April, Apple's Indian suppliers exported nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the U.S., a record figure. The company also reportedly chartered cargo flights to move 600 tons of iPhones from India to the U.S.Former President Donald Trump, who reimposed the tariffs, recently said he advised Apple CEO Tim Cook against manufacturing iPhones in India, arguing the country could take care of themselves.Apple shares closed at $208.78 on May 19, down 1.17%.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:762cf2c93094b:0-apple-aapl-sees-iphone-shipments-plunge-amid-tariff-escalation/
Apple (AAPL) Faces Trump Tariff Threat Over Overseas iPhone Production,1748029412000,"President Donald Trump on Friday warned Apple (AAPL, Financials) it must manufacture iPhones in the United States or face a 25% tariff on imports, escalating tensions over the company's production shift to India.Apple could see steep cost increases if forced to reshore production. Trump's comments followed recent meetings with CEO Tim Cook, where he objected to Apple's plans to manufacture U.S.-bound iPhones in India.Apple reported that roughly 90% of iPhones are still produced in China despite ongoing diversification efforts. The company warned investors it could incur $900 million in tariff-related costs this quarter alone, driven by shifting production from China to India.According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, moving even 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S. would cost $30 billion and take at least three years. Fully reshoring could require five to ten years and push iPhone prices to around $3,500 per unit due to high domestic labor and infrastructure costs.Trump's broader tariff plan includes a 10% universal tariff and a reduced 30% tariff on most Chinese goods, down from 145% earlier in the month. Electronics, including iPhones, were previously exempt from higher tariffs, but Apple's India plans appear to have reignited Trump's ire.Apple has committed $500 billion to U.S.-based initiatives in 2025, including a server facility in Houston and expanded data center capacity to support its AI product suite, Apple Intelligence. Despite this, large-scale chip manufacturing remains dependent on Asian supply chains, although some Apple chips are now being produced at a TSMC plant in Arizona.Analysts say reshoring is logistically unfeasible. Wedbush reiterated that full domestic production is a fairy tale, noting the complexity of replicating Asia's supply ecosystem.Investors should monitor potential pricing changes in Apple's next iPhone release this fall and watch for any formal tariff implementation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6c644746f094b:0-apple-aapl-faces-trump-tariff-threat-over-overseas-iphone-production/
Wall Street Goes 24/7? Kraken's Bold Plan to Tokenize Tesla and Apple Shocks Markets,1747942921000,"Kraken is gearing up to change how global investors access U.S. stocksby putting them on the blockchain. The U.S.-based crypto exchange will soon launch ""xStocks,"" tokenized versions of over 50 popular equities and ETFs, including Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). These tokens will trade 24/7 on the Solana blockchain and initially be available to users in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africaexcluding the U.S. Kraken says this model could streamline access for investors who've long dealt with clunky settlement systems and high fees through local brokerages.Each xStock will be backed 1:1 by the underlying asset, held and managed by Kraken's partner, Backed Finance. The tokens are redeemable for cash value, and the company hopes this will help keep pricing aligned with real-time market movements. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi noted that traditional cross-border investing is still burdened by friction, and this could be a more cost-effective workaround. If it works, tokenized stocks may not just give international investors easier accessthey might also open up new use cases like pledging tokenized Tesla shares as collateral for DeFi strategies.It's not the first time someone's tried this. Binance launched a similar product in 2021, only to shut it down after regulatory pushback. Kraken is taking a different route, actively engaging with regulators across various countries. The timing also aligns with broader conversations in Washington around crypto and tokenization. With firms like BlackRock and Robinhood now backing similar ideas, Kraken's launch could be more than a new productit might be a preview of where traditional finance is headed.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:e32ae4275094b:0-wall-street-goes-24-7-kraken-s-bold-plan-to-tokenize-tesla-and-apple-shocks-markets/
Apple Just Unlocked Its AI Brain--And Developers Could Strike Gold,1747773384000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL is about to hand the keys to its AI engine over to developersand it could be the smartest move it's made in years. At WWDC on June 9, the tech giant is expected to unveil a new SDK and frameworks that let third-party developers build AI features directly on top of Apple's own language models. For now, these are the smaller models that run locally on devices, not the heavier, cloud-based ones. But even this step could unleash a wave of creativity that Apple desperately needs in its push to stay relevant in the AI race.Why now? Because Apple Intelligencethe platform that was supposed to mark Apple's generative AI erahasn't exactly lit the world on fire. Developers had limited hooks to work with, and many turned to external solutions like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's TensorFlow. Meanwhile, apps like Claude and Grok are already thriving on the App Store. Apple knows this game: when it opened up iOS to app developers in 2008, it created an entire economy. Now, it's betting that giving developers direct access to its own AI models could do the samethis time for AI.There's more coming. Apple is also prepping a unified operating system experience across iPhone, iPad, and Macunder the codename Solariumand plans to drop new features like an AI-powered battery mode and a virtual wellness coach (coming 2026). On the business side, Apple still earns a slice of subscription revenue from App Store apps, but that pie is shrinking as regulators force open payment pathways. If developer-built AI apps take off, it could plug the revenue holeand give Apple's AI play the jolt it's been missing.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8e6f9549b094b:0-apple-just-unlocked-its-ai-brain-and-developers-could-strike-gold/

"Trump's Renewed Tariff Threats Undermine Market Momentum, Wells Fargo Says",1748025478000,"US President Donald Trump announced potential new tariffs, including a 50% duty on imports from the European Union and a 25% levy on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL iPhones not manufactured in the US, which triggered a sell-off impacting equities, bonds and commodities, Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note on Friday. Wells Fargo said a pause on reciprocal tariffs helped support an equity rally over the past six weeks, while ""US economic data has shown some capacity to resist a recession."" However, renewed threats undermine that momentum and reinforce a cautious outlook, the investment advisory firm said. Wells Fargo said its equity guidance prioritizes quality and prefers US equities over international due to lower trade dependence and recommends large-cap and mid-cap US stocks in technology, communication, financials and energy sectors. European equities, S&P 500 futures, US Treasury yields, and crude oil futures all declined, while the US dollar strengthened as expectations rose for a European Central Bank rate cut, according to the note.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384899:0/

"Apple May Need to Change Course on Price, Supply Chains Amid Renewed Trump Rhetoric — Market Talk",1748024880000,"Apple has sought to avoid the brunt of tariff pressures by shipping iPhone products to the US from India and Vietnam, but it hasn't been enough to placate President Trump. Trump said today iPhones manufactured abroad could face import taxes of at least 25%, noting he expects the devices to be made in the U.S. and not in China, India, or elsewhere. ""Given the deal with China, Apple will have been hoping that tensions with the US government would begin to ease, but this has appeared to be a false dawn,"" says Quilter Cheviot's Ben Barringer.

Sam Altman and Jony Ive Are Planning a Device for the AI Era. It Won't Be Easy. — Barrons.com,1747938540000,"By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back — and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Cramer is worried about Apple: here’s why,1747935537000,"Famed investor Jim Cramer reveals he is worried about Apple, a stock that he has owned for more than a decade. Cramer is worried that Apple is losing easy revenue through regulatory tussles, geopolitical pressure, and OpenAI’s latest move. Apple in April lost its crown as the most valuable company in the world, with its market capitalisation declining beneath Microsoft.Nvidia also raced past the iPhone maker’s valuation as Apple is now trading as the third most valuable company with a $3 trillion valuation. In its Q2 results, the company’s earnings beat estimates, though iPhone sales plunged 10%. On Thursday, Apple shares were down 0.13%, and the stock is down 17% in the year so far.Losing easy moneyCramer points out that the first big problem for Apple is losing $20 billion from Google due to the antitrust case against Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Alphabet reportedly pays Apple $20 billion annually to make sure Google is the default search engine on iPhone and iPad. In the US antitrust case against Google for its monopoly in the search engine market.While Cramer said Apple could make the money by other methods, like charging other search platforms, the “Alphabet deal was $1 a share in easy profits that could go away”, he said.Legal strugglesApple’s legal case with Fortnite maker Epic Games is another area of concern for Cramer. Apple’s battle with Epic Games over app store payments could cause another 30-cent departure in the company’s earnings per share, Cramer noted. Recently, a federal judge slammed Apple over non-compliance with opening up its app store to alternative payment methods. The judge had ruled that the Cupertino-based company stop charging commissions on payments made outside Apple’s payment system. Apple charges a 30% commission on payments made on its App Store.The Fortnite game is now available on the Apple store, five years after Apple kicked it out. Trump factorApple’s plans to diversify its production from China to India is also facing a potential roadblock with US President Donald Trump wanting more. Trump recently criticised Apple’s decision to build in India. Trump wants Apple to manufacture in the US, which would cause a 13 times increase in manufacturing costs. The move would reduce Apple’s margins from its flagship product from $450 to just $60 if prices are not raised. Cramer flags this also as a problem, as making iPhones in the US could erode “one of the great American triumphs to rival smartphone maker Samsung, a Korean company”, he said.He says that without Trump’s blessing lot of havoc would happen against Apple. The host of CNBC’s Mad Money also said the US regulators are looking into Apple’s recent deal with Alibaba.Cramer said this partnership was the best source of new business for Apple in China. He adds that these deals, which were once seen as an American strength, are now viewed as US weakness and a boost for China.OpenAI threatOpenAI’s recent acquisition of a startup founded by former Apple design chief is also a concern for Cramer. OpenAI’s bid to make AI-enabled hardware is a question mark over Apple, according to Kramer. He adds that while he is not worried about long-term prospects, he says he won’t buy anymore stock in the current juncture.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:a7c04b149094b:0-cramer-is-worried-about-apple-here-s-why/

"Apple Leans Into AI at WWDC, GS Sets $253 Target",1747925518000,"Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng sees heavy AI emphasis at Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL Worldwide Developers Conference, forecasting developer access to Apple's in-house models and potential Gemini AI integration on iPhonesechoing Alphabet's Sundar Pichai remark that a mid-2025 Apple partnership could be imminent. Ng, who maintains a Buy rating with a $253 price target, notes that Apple will need to showcase compelling Apple Intelligence features (think AI-enhanced Siri, on-screen awareness and personal context slated for late 2025/26) before Wall Street fully underwrites AI as a growth lever.Ng expects Apple to refresh iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS with standardized interfaces and convenience features, including public Wi-Fi syncing and AI-driven battery optimization in iOS 19. He also anticipates Apple opening its large language models to third-party developers and enhancing Siri's capabilities. While AAPL has outperformed the S&P 500 by 12% year-to-date, it slipped 2.31% today as investors weighed near-term AI proof points against lofty expectations. Compared with last year's WWDC, which focused on lock-screen widgets and privacy upgrades, this year's event could mark Apple's most significant AI push yetone that rivals Google's I/O showcase in early May.Why It Matters Investors looking for catalysts will gauge whether Apple's AI demos and OS unification translate into tangible developer enthusiasm and, ultimately, stronger service-revenue growth amid slowing hardware demand.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:12c4928d8094b:0-apple-leans-into-ai-at-wwdc-gs-sets-253-target/
Apple's Stock Still Not Pricing in Trump's Demands - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1748023200000,"By Dan GallagherWhat do you do when the most powerful person in the world demands the impossible? If you're an Apple shareholder, you better settle in for a long, uncomfortable haul.Apple's share price took another tumble on Friday, after President Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on any iPhone made overseas. This is part of his push to have all iPhones sold in the U.S. made there as well. The stock has been on a mostly downward slope since Apple's disappointing earnings report on May 1 and has put the company's market value below that of Microsoft and Nvidia.That's far from a worst-case scenario. Apple's share price Friday morning represented a multiple of about 26 times projected earnings for the next four quarters. That's nearly in line with the company's five year average, according to FactSet data.That means more downside is possible-even for a stock now off 22% so far this year. If Trump's demands stick, Apple will likely simply pay the 25% tariff on its iPhones made in India and pass at least some of those costs on to its customers. That would be a far more palatable option than trying to move its massive, Asia-based supply chain to the U.S., which would take many years and hundreds of billions of dollars in a best-case scenario.But paying the additional tariffs has its downside as well. In a report earlier this month, Edison Lee of Jefferies said every percentage point increase in tariffs above ""current assumptions"" translates into a 1.5% impact on Apple's pre-tax profits this year.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

Trump Threatens European Union With 50% Tariffs; ING Says Trade War Fears Return,1748022717000,"US President Donald Trump on Friday proposed a 50% tariff rate on the European Union, a move that ING Bank said has ""reignited"" concerns about a transatlantic trade war. In a social media post, Trump recommended that a ""straight"" 50% tariff rate be applied on the EU starting June 1, saying that his administration's talks with the bloc had stalled. When Trump disclosed his reciprocal tariffs early in April, he set a 20% charge on imports from the EU. Trump on Friday criticized the bloc for what he said were ""powerful"" trade barriers. US benchmark equity indexes were down intraday. ""A relatively calm week comes to an abrupt and disappointing close, serving as a stark reminder that we remain far from any 'beautiful trade deals' or return to normality,"" ING said in a report published Friday. ""Volatility is back.""In a separate social media post Friday, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple slid 2.7%. Trump declared a 90-day pause on certain tariffs for non-retaliating countries in April. Recently, the US and China agreed to suspend most levies on each other's goods for 90 days, while Washington reached a trade deal with the UK. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed countermeasures on up to 95 billion euros ($107.82 billion) worth of US imports if negotiations with the Trump administration collapse, Reuters reported May 8. The bloc has offered a 50-billion-euro trade deal that includes liquefied natural gas purchases and no tariffs on cars and industrial goods, ING said. The White House appears to be ""dissatisfied"" with the EU's efforts to secure a deal, according to the brokerage. The EU didn't respond to MT Newswires' request for comment on Trump's latest tariff threat. ""While the EU is slower to act, it has prepared a couple of retaliatory tariff measures which are currently scheduled to enter into force (July 14),"" ING wrote. ""If talks truly collapse, expect the EU to reach for its heaviest artillery, such as tighter regulations on US tech firms, delaying licenses or restricting public procurement access and limiting (intellectual property) rights and investment flows under the Anti-Coercion Instrument.""",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384854:0/

The Nasdaq Composite underperformed, slipping 0.9 percent as big tech stocks bore the brunt of the pressure.Apple led the tech rout, falling over 2 percent after Trump took aim at the company in a post on Truth Social. He warned that iPhones sold in the United States should be manufactured domestically — or else face a 25 percent tariff. This marks the first time Trump has zeroed in on a specific company as part of his renewed push for tariffs this year.Semiconductor stocks also struggled. Shares of Micron and Qualcomm both fell 2 percent, while Nvidia gave up 1 percent.Adding to the market’s jitters, Trump said trade talks with the European Union were “going nowhere,” and floated the idea of slapping a 50 percent tariff on EU goods beginning June 1, 2025.In April, Trump’s broad-based tariffs had rattled investors and pushed the S&P 500 close to bear market territory.

Apple Ignores Trump Over Indian iPhone Plan. Why That's Probably Smart. — Barrons.com,1747754580000,"By Adam ClarkApple looks to be driving ahead with its plans to assemble iPhones for the U.S. market in India, despite President Donald Trump's opposition to the move. It's a risk, but a sensible one for the company.Apple is increasing production of iPhones in India in a bid to diversify its production away from China in response to the tariffs Trump has imposed on China. Trump has publicly criticized the move, saying he had ""a little problem"" with Apple CEO Tim Cook and calling on the company to build in the U.S. instead.The latest evidence is that Apple isn't changing its mind, despite Trump's comments and a temporary tariff truce between Beijing and Washington.India's Tata Electronics has begun assembly of iPhone 16 products at its facility in the city of Hosur, according to a Tuesday report from local newspaper The Economic Times. Meanwhile, Apple's supplier Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, said in a filing on Monday that it would invest $1.49 billion in its India unit.It is hard to imagine Apple's partners going ahead with such plans without guarantees that the company will stick to a significant increase in Indian production. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on Trump's remarks or its plans in India.Apple shifting production might look a little odd at the moment, considering India is facing a potential 26% tariff on imports to the U.S., while levies on Chinese goods have been temporarily slashed to 30%. The shift risks the wrath of the president while also incurring significant costs — $900 million for the June quarter, according to Cook.On the other hand, having both India and China as significant bases should give the company flexibility to split production of its iPhones for the American and global markets depending on what tariff agreements are reached.""We believe that Apple could ramp iPhone assembly production in India up to 60%-65% by the Fall in a best case scenario but could easily pivot back to a China driven iPhone strategy depending on the tariff situation and deal negotiations,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent research note.Ives estimates that making an iPhone in the U.S. would probably lead to a retail price of around $3,500 compared with around $1,000 currently, saying that it would take years to build the production capacity that would make that possible.Ives kept an Outperform rating and $270 target price on Apple stock.

Apple Faces Growth Constraints as Analysts Cite Market Headwinds,1747752672000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL tumbles amid tariff and Services revenue headwinds, down roughly 17% year-to-date despite the U.S.China trade deal. Despite favorable bilateral terms, analysts warn that lingering tariff uncertainties, macro pressures on consumer spending and fierce smartphone competition have crimped growth, while Services revenue in the March quarter fell short of expectations.

The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9% to 18,762.4, with the S&P 500 down 0.6% to 5,805.8 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5% lower at 41,634.2. All sectors except utilities and consumer staples fell intraday, led by technology and consumer discretionary. In a social media post, Trump said trade talks with the European Union are going nowhere, and he is ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the bloc starting June 1. The EU is the US's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of total trade, a Stifel note said. In 2024, US goods exports to the EU totaled $370 billion, up 0.7% from the year prior, while imports from the EU were $606 billion, a 5.1% increase from 2023. As a result, the trade deficit with the EU totaled $236 billion in 2024, a $27 billion uptick from 2023. The ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's performance against the world's major currencies, slumped 0.7% to 99.17. Trump also threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the iconic technology giant, formerly the biggest in the world by market capitalization, sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares dropped 2.7% intraday, the biggest laggard on the Dow. ""We remain on a knife's edge as not a day goes by without the US administration practicing self-harm against US interests and taking the world down with it,"" Derek Holt, head of capital market economics at Scotiabank, said in a note. ""From tariffs to irresponsible fiscal profligacy, to destroying the value of the US signature on international agreements it has signed, and to debasing the dollar's credibility, great damage has clearly been done.""Gold futures surged 2% to $3,388.30 per ounce. ""Gold is heading for its best week in a month on raised US fiscal debt concerns following a jump in US long-end yields in response to Trump's tax bill, which will swell an already elevated US debt pile,"" Saxo Bank said in a note. Treasury yields were mixed intraday, with the mid-to-long dated maturities declining. The 10-year yield dropped 4.4 basis points to 4.51%. The 30-year yield retreated 3.1 basis points to 5.03%, but it remained above the psychologically important 5% level. Both the maturities headed higher this week after the House of Representatives voted 215-214 in favor of a budget reconciliation bill that will likely balloon the country's deficit by $2.3 trillion. In company news, Ross Stores NASDAQ:ROST overnight warned that elevated tariffs could pressure profitability, noting that over half its merchandise originates from China despite limited direct imports. Citing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting trade policies, the company withdrew its full-year sales and earnings guidance. Its shares slumped 11% intraday, among the worst on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Deckers Outdoor's NYSE:DECK strong fiscal fourth-quarter results were overshadowed by sales growth deceleration at its Hoka sneaker brand and potential demand weakness from price increases, prompting KeyBanc Capital Markets to downgrade the footwear and apparel company's stock.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2% to 18,699.1, with the S&P 500 down 0.9% to 5,788.2 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.7% lower at 41,551.3. All sectors except utilities fell intraday, led by technology and consumer discretionary. Trump said in a social media post that trade talks with the European Union are going nowhere and he is ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the bloc starting on June 1. The EU is the US's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of total trade, according to a note from Stifel. In 2024, US goods exports to the EU totaled $370 billion, up 0.7% from the year prior, while imports from the EU were $606 billion, a 5.1% increase from 2023. As a result, the trade deficit with the EU totaled $236 billion in 2024, a $27 billion uptick from 2023. Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the technology giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares dropped 2.4% intraday, the biggest laggard on the Dow. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their (iPhones) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday.

"Stock Market News for May 22, 2025",1747909440000,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday following spike in yields of long-dated U.S. sovereign bonds. Market participants remained concerned that the proposed tax-cut bill of President Trump will further worsen U.S. fiscal deficit. The U.S.-China tariff war also remained unresolved. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 1.9% or 816.80 points to close at 41,860.44. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and one finished in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 18,872.64, sliding 1.4% due to weak performance of technology bigwigs. Technology giants like Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors.

Apple Can't Really Make iPhones in the U.S. What It May Do to Offset Tariffs. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"Tae KimApple is facing difficult choices if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to put a big tariff on iPhones.On Friday, Trump said he would impose tariff of at least 25% on Apple iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the smartphones are made domestically. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the last earnings call that more iPhones sold in the U.S. will be made in India as Apple continues to geographically diversify its manufacturing footprint.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump wrote in a post on social-media platform Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president added.In early trading Friday, Apple shares fell by 2.6% to $196.17.Trump has been resolute about the topic. Last month, when asked by a reporter if Trump wants iPhones to be made domestically, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: ""Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.""Wall Street analysts, however, generally believe domestic iPhone manufacturing isn't tenable on a financial basis. The company relies on the contract manufacturer Foxconn to make the vast majority of its iPhones in China. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimates an iPhone made in the U.S. would be sold at $3,500 versus $1,000 today.""We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhone in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" Ives wrote on Friday, adding such a move to shift production would take five to 10 years.In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. Jobs bluntly replied: ""Those jobs aren't coming back,"" citing how only Asia has the supply chain ecosystem, from screws to rubber gaskets, along with thousands of specialized manufacturing engineers needed to make smartphones.If Trump doesn't back down, Apple faces several options to revamp its product strategy to mitigate the impact from tariffs.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has suggested Apple can remove the less-profitable, low-end storage models from its iPhone lineup. A ""targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,"" Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has said Apple can move new launches to a two-year schedule from annually. That would to help simplify the supply chain by extending the timeline on expensive manufacturing changes.Of course, Apple can decide to fight Trump and pressure him to revoke an iPhone tariff.

OpenAI acquires Jony Ive’s AI startup io in landmark $6.5B deal: should Apple be concerned?,1747892436000,"OpenAI will acquire io, the secretive artificial intelligence hardware startup co-founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, in a landmark all-stock transaction valued at nearly $6.5 billion. The move is OpenAI’s most significant acquisition to date and signals a determined push into developing physical consumer devices powered by AI.The purchase gives OpenAI access not only to io’s team of around 55 engineers and designers but also to the creative vision of Ive, the British-born designer behind Apple’s most iconic products including the iPhone, iPod, and MacBook Air. The acquisition also formalises a relationship that has been in the making for nearly two years, as Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have quietly explored new device ideas together.“I have a growing sense that everything I’ve learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place and to this moment,” Ive said in a joint interview with Altman.

The team, now under OpenAI’s umbrella, will focus on building what Altman and Ive describe as “a family of devices” for the age of artificial general intelligence.The duo did not share specifics about the hardware under development but indicated that the first product would not simply be an iteration of the smartphone or laptop, but an entirely new computing form factor designed to complement AI’s growing capabilities. “People have an appetite for something new,” Ive said, hinting at user fatigue with current devices.Altman added, “AI is such a big leap forward in terms of what people can do that it needs a new kind of computing form factor to get the maximum potential out of it.”The first device from the collaboration is slated for release in 2026.Who is Jony Ive?Once described by Steve Jobs as his “spiritual partner”, Jony Ive’s return to the heart of consumer technology marks a significant comeback for one of the most influential designers of the modern era. The British-born designer spent decades at Apple, where he worked closely with Steve Jobs to shape products that would define a generation, including the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple Watch.

After leaving Apple, Ive founded the design firm LoveFrom, a creative collective composed of former Apple colleagues and longtime collaborators. In 2023, he co-founded the startup io with Apple veterans Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan — each with deep experience in the company’s hardware ecosystem.

That mission now becomes part of OpenAI’s strategy as it seeks to embed intelligence not just in software but across the physical world.The hardware ambitions are supported by other investors including Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective, Thrive Capital, Maverick Capital, and SV Angel. OpenAI confirmed that Altman holds no personal equity in io.Apple shares fall amid concerns over AI leadershipNews of the acquisition sent Apple shares down as much as 2.3% on Wednesday, as the market absorbed the implications of its former star designer now leading the charge at one of its AI rivals. Apple has been seen as lagging behind in artificial intelligence, with its recently introduced AI platform partly dependent on OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Analysts say the move could accelerate Apple’s perceived decline in AI leadership and product innovation. “Jobs would be damn proud,” Altman said of the new venture, praising Ive’s creative legacy and calling their collaboration a “rare opportunity.”Though the move poses potential competition for Apple, Altman and Ive were careful to note that their project does not aim to replace the smartphone. “In the same way that the smartphone didn’t make the laptop go away, I don’t think our first thing is going to make the smartphone go away,” Altman said.Building AI’s physical futureOpenAI’s push into consumer hardware arrives as competition in AI intensifies. The company, currently valued at $300 billion, is racing to keep pace with rivals including Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI. All are investing aggressively and rapidly launching new AI models and features.To support its expansion, OpenAI has bolstered its hardware and robotics expertise. In November, it hired Caitlin “CK” Kalinowski, the former head of Meta’s Orion augmented reality glasses project, to lead its consumer hardware and robotics efforts. Kalinowski said the goal was to “unlock AI’s benefits for humanity” through physical products.In a separate effort, OpenAI also invested in San Francisco-based robotics startup Physical Intelligence, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion valuation.

The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

EU antitrust authorities circulated a new series of questions last week to market participants on ""scheme fees"" they levy on financial institutions that provide card-payment services to retailers using Visa NYSE:V and Mastercard NYSE:MA networks, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The probe could lead to fines totaling 10% of annual revenue if authorities find the companies guilty of abusing their market dominance, the report said.

The U.S. Lost Its Perfect Credit Rating. Who Still Has It. — Barrons.com,1747687980000,"By Anita HamiltonThe U.S. lost its top credit rating from Moody's over the weekend, but 11 other countries still have it.Those countries are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland.Companies also get rated by Moody's, which provides a globally recognized standard of creditworthiness.

What Sam Altman Told OpenAI About the Secret Device He's Making With Jony Ive — WSJ,1747882740000,"Berber JinOpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave his staff a preview Wednesday of the devices he is developing to build with former Apple designer Jony Ive, laying out plans to ship 100 million AI ""companions"" that he hopes will become a part of everyday life.Altman told employees that they had ""the chance to do the biggest thing we've ever done as a company here,"" he said after announcing OpenAI's plans to purchase Ive's startup, named io, and give him an expansive creative and design role. He suggested the $6.5 billion acquisition has the potential to add $1 trillion in value to OpenAI, according to a recording reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.In the meeting, Ive noted how closely he worked with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs before his passing in 2011. With Altman, ""the way that we clicked, and the way that we've been able to work together, has been profound for me.""Altman and Ive offered a few hints at the secret project they have been working on. The product will be capable of being fully aware of a user's surroundings and life, will be unobtrusive, able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the device won't be a phone, and that Ive and Altman's intent is to help wean users off of screens. Altman said the device also isn't a pair of glasses, and that Ive had been skeptical about building something to wear on the body.Ive referenced ""a new design movement."" Altman said it would amount to a ""family of devices,"" bringing up his fondness for how Apple has long integrated its hardware and software offerings.Altman told OpenAI staff that stealth will be important for their ultimate success to avoid competitors copying the product before it's ready.For months, Ive's team has been speaking with vendors who will be able to ship the device at scale. ""We're not going to ship 100 million devices literally on day one,"" Altman said, predicting that OpenAI would ship that large quantity of high-quality devices ""faster than any company has ever shipped 100 million of something new before."" Altman said the goal is to release a device by late next year.The grandiose plans echo Altman's bold vision for OpenAI's expansion in many spheres, including for data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars, enterprise technology, chatbots, personal robots and beyond.Rolling out new devices, especially ones that will compete with deep-pocketed, multitrillion-dollar companies like Apple or Google, has long been among the most difficult of challenges in the tech industry. Humane, another startup made up of former Apple executives that Altman invested in, sold an ""Ai Pin"" that failed to catch on with consumers.And OpenAI is already bleeding cash. The startup told investors last fall it won't generate a profit until 2029, and it expects to lose $44 billion before doing so, the Journal has reported.While Apple and Google have struggled to keep pace with AI innovations, many investors see the two companies — whose software runs nearly all the world's smartphones — as the primary means through which billions of people will access AI tools and chatbots. Building a device is the only way OpenAI and other artificial-intelligence companies will be able to interact with consumers directly.Altman and Ive also offered details about how their collaboration grew in the last several years. Eighteen months ago, OpenAI's Vice President of Product Peter Welinder began working with Ive's team. The two sides became excited about a specific device last fall.The original plan was for Ive's startup to build and sell its own device using OpenAI's technology, but Altman said he eventually realized that wouldn't work. Altman said he knew the two companies would have to be combined because the device wasn't just an accessory but a central facet of the user relationship with OpenAI.""We both got excited about the idea that, if you subscribed to ChatGPT, we should just mail you new computers, and you should use those,"" Altman said.Altman said he and Ive came to believe that existing devices wouldn't work. While ChatGPT changed people's expectations about the power of technology, it is still being used in an old paradigm: holding a laptop, launching a website, and typing something in and waiting.""It is not the sci-fi dream of what AI could do to enable you in all the ways that I think the models are capable of,"" Altman said.Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521011770:0/
Alibaba Tumbles as Apple AI Pact Faces Scrutiny,1747683397000,"Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL AI pact sends Alibaba NYSE:BABA shares skidding after US scrutiny, The New York Times reports. BABA plunged as much as 4.8% in Hong Kong on Mondayleading the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lowerafter the White House flagged Alibaba's planned deal to embed its AI on Apple's iPhones in China. That drop compounds pressure on Alibaba, whose quarterly revenue recently came in below consensus as iPhone sales in China slid 2.3% in the quarter ended March 29.The proposed partnership, first announced by Alibaba Chairman Joseph Tsai in February, would have Alibaba's AI powering Siri-style features on iPhones sold within China's tightly regulated market. Apple has been exploring similar tie-ups with Baidu NASDAQ:BIDU and even weighed deals with ByteDance, Tencent (TCEHY) and startup DeepSeekbefore ruling DeepSeek out for lack of scale. U.S. officials fear the arrangement could expose sensitive data or bolster a Chinese firm's global ambitions, potentially derailing Apple's broader AI rollout.For Alibaba, this latest regulatory headwind comes amid a broader slowdown: revenue growth has decelerated as the company grapples with stiff competition from Xiaomi (XIACF), Huawei and a softening e-commerce environment. The stock's recent 15% drawdown from its year-to-date peak underscores investor unease around regulatory risk and execution challenges in its core markets.Why It Matters: A stalled AI partnership with Apple could delay Alibaba's push into high-margin services, while raising fresh doubts about U.S.China tech cooperation and Alibaba's near-term growth outlook.Analyst sentiment on Alibaba Group Holding is showing subtle strain. While the total number of ratings edged up to 44, the number of Underperform calls jumped to 7more than triple the previous months. At the same time, Buy ratings dipped to 14, their lowest in five months. This shift suggests growing caution despite a still-broad base of support.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:91ac4507e094b:0-alibaba-tumbles-as-apple-ai-pact-faces-scrutiny/
"Goodbye Trump Put, Hello 'Trump Strangle' — Market Talk",1748012460000,"When President Trump backed down from his harsh bilateral ""Liberation Day"" tariffs last month, investors took heart that the ""Trump put"" was alive and well--a bet that Trump's instincts for appeasement in the face of market downturns place a floor under asset prices. Brent Donnelly of Spectra Markets says new tariff threats show another feature of Trump's reaction function: When markets stabilize, Trump takes it as a blessing to resume his previous provocations.

Markets Slide on Bond Option; Q1 Earnings After the Close,1747864740000,"Wednesday, May 21, 2025A couple things happened mid-day that sent a steady flat-to-down session falling into the red and staying there. Market indexes closed off their lows, but appeared to be trending back down in the final minutes before the close. The Dow slip -816 points, -1.91%, the S&P 500 -95, -1.61%, the Nasdaq -270, -1.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 -55 points, -2.63%.One occurrence was a sell-off in bonds, likely having something to do with the U.S. government planning to add to the overall deficit with a major tax cut bill working its way through Congress. The three credit rating agencies have already downgraded the U.S. from AAA, and now this bond option has led to spiking Treasury yields: +4.59% on the 10-year, +4.01% on the 2-year, and back up over +5% on the 30-year bond.The other event was more localized in the realm of AI and concerning the original designer of the iPhone, Jony Ive. Ive’s AI startup io is going to Sam Altman’s OpenAI for a cool $6.4 billion, and without many details the market priced in a discount at Apple AAPL, which closed -2.3% on the day. What this move signals in a broader sense, however, is that access to AI design and implementation is becoming increasingly competitive.Q1 Earnings After the Close: URBN, SNOW, ZMUrban Outfitters URBN posted solid beats on its Q1 report after today’s closing bell, with earnings of $1.16 per share easily outperforming the 81 cents expected. Revenues of $1.33 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks consensus of $1.29 billion. Comps rose +4.8% year over year, led by Anthropologie. Company subscribers rose by nearly +60%. The retailer made no mention of tariff impacts on future gains. Shares are up +9% after hours. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Data storage firm Snowflake SNOW also outpaced estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with earnings of 24 cents per share beating expectations by 2 cents on quarterly sales of $1.04 billion, which improved over the $1.00 billion analysts were anticipating. Product revenue guidance was placed much higher for Q2: $997 million versus $962 million previously expected. Shares gained +7% on the news in late trading.Zoom Communications ZM makes it 3-for-3 following Wednesday’s close: earnings of $1.43 per share “zoomed” past the Zacks consensus $1.30, with revenues eking out a slight beat: $1.17 billion versus $1.16 billion. Earnings guidance was lifted while revenues were kept in-line, as gains in Enterprise outperformed estimates. The videoconferencing services firm had jumped higher on the news, but have moderated somewhat.What to Expect from the Stock Market ThursdayFinally, tomorrow morning we see some economic reportage, including Weekly Jobless Claims, S&P flash Services and Manufacturing PMI, and Existing Home Sales. Expectations are for jobless claims to remain steady at the slightly higher levels we’ve seen over the past few weeks, lower PMI results with Services remaining above the 50 threshold but Manufacturing dipping below it, and home sales coming in slightly higher month over month.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

U.S. Stock Futures Plunge on Trump Tariff Concerns,1748012160000,"Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet.After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation.

The bank also slashed its stock-price target to $270 from $490, with the new target implying about 12% downside from current levels.Consumer stocks also came under pressure on Wednesday. Shares of Nike Inc.

Stocks tally worst session in a month as weak bond-market auction has investors wondering how U.S. will manage its debt,1747858620000,"By Joseph Adinolfi and Joy WiltermuthWorries about rising bond yields are coming home to roost, sending the Dow down 800 pointsInvestors have been warily eyeing rising Treasury yields since the start of May, with some fretting that the latest jump in borrowing costs could soon start hurting stocks.Those fears were realized on Wednesday, as a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields climbing to fresh highs. Borrowing costs tied to long-dated debt touched levels not seen since late 2023.That sent stocks reeling, with major indexes tallying their worst session since April 21, Dow Jones Market Data showed.""Looks like we are sinking,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said after the weak 20-year bond auction.The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was knocking on the door of the 4.6% level, and concerns about tariffs and ""the battle of the budget"" remain, he said.Republicans are working to pass President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill. The latest version of the legislation included tax and spending cuts but would do little to pare the U.S. budget deficit.""When you have yields jumping up like this, it's a tough crosscurrent for stocks,"" Cardillo said.Stocks had shaken off some of their early losses heading into the afternoon, as gains for Big Tech names like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into the green.But around 1 p.m., the market suffered a one-two punch. Reports that OpenAI would buy an artificial-intelligence company founded by former Apple Inc. (AAPL) design chief Jony Ive appeared to weigh on shares of Ive's former employer.Around the same time, the weak 20-year BX:TMUBMUSD20Y auction helped revive concerns about waning foreign demand for U.S. debt. Suddenly, investors were starting to question how the U.S. would manage its debt burden over the long term.This, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy, was enough to weigh on stocks, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Management.See: Why the next 20-year Treasury auction is 'must-see TV' for investors after the Moody's downgrade""It's a question of how much growth are we going to get, and what is the revenue stream for the U.S. government looking like to support the debt that they're issuing,"" he said.Mulberry also pointed out that pain in debt markets was a global phenomenon on Wednesday, as yields on bonds trading in Japan and Europe also spiked.Earlier, investors digested weak earnings from Target Corp. (TGT), along with a report from fellow retailer TJX Cos. (TJX), the parent of TJ Maxx, which Mulberry described as not as bad as Target's, but still not great. Shares of both companies were selling off.Meanwhile, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) fell further, heaping more pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was also weakening, signaling that the ""Sell America"" trade might be back on, at least for now. Meanwhile, gold (GC00) and bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed, with the latter hitting a fresh record high north of $109,000 per coin.The S&P 500 SPX finished 95.85 points, or 1.6%, lower at 5,844.61, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 270.07 points, or 1.4%, at 18,872.64.

"US Equity Indexes Mixed as Moody's Sovereign Rating Cut Sends Treasury Yields Higher, Dollar Lower",1747674238000,"US equity indexes traded mixed while government bond yields jumped and the dollar weakened as investors reacted to Moody's downgrade of the United States' sovereign credit rating late last week. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.1% to 19,188.1, and the S&P 500 was up less than 0.1% at 5,959.2 after midday on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 42,779.1, after trading slightly lower earlier in the session. Energy, technology, and communication services led the decliners intraday. After the market closed on Friday, Moody's lowered the US government's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Aa1 from Aaa and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The cut reflected increased government debt and interest payment ratios to levels significantly above sovereigns with a similar rating in over a decade. Its move follows a downgrade from S&P Global Ratings in 2011 and Fitch Ratings in 2023. Both have AA+ as the US credit rating. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's sweeping tax-cut bill reportedly passed a key congressional hurdle on Sunday after four holdout Republican conservatives allowed it to move forward. Reuters reported non-partisan analysts said the bill would add $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the US debt over the next decade. US debt now stands at $36.22 trillion, just about doubling in the past 10 years alone, Stifel said in a note. Citing the Congressional Budget Office, Stifel expects debt to rise to over $59 trillion in the decade ahead. The ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's performance against the world's major currencies, slumped 0.7% to 100.43. Gold futures increased 1.5% to $3,235.51 per ounce. Moody's downgrade confirms that fiscal health issues remain significant, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note Monday. Debates around related government policies will likely intensify over the next three months, especially as Congress attempts to reconcile the budget, extend tax cuts, and increase the debt ceiling. ""The US Treasury market remains the largest and most liquid in the world, and we anticipate no imminent change to the importance of the US Treasury market to global investors,"" the WFII note said. US Treasury yields jumped intraday. The US 10-year was up 4.8 basis points to 4.49%, after hitting 4.54% earlier in the day. The 30-year rate jumped 5.5 basis points to 4.95%, after trading at around 5.03% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, in economic news, the Conference Board's measure of leading indicators fell by 1% in April, compared with expectations for a 0.9% decrease in a Bloomberg-compiled survey and a 0.8% decline in March. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures jumped 1.4% to $63.36 a barrel. In company news, Apple NASDAQ:AAPL is facing scrutiny from the White House and congressional officials over its plan to use Alibaba Group's NYSE:BABA artificial intelligence technology on iPhones in China, The New York Times reported Saturday, citing three people familiar with the matter.

Pre-Markets Drop Hard on New Trump Tariff Talk,1748010600000,"Friday, May 23, 2025Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation.

OpenAI's $6.5B Power Move: Jony Ive Is Back to Reinvent the Future of Tech,1747855900000,"OpenAI just made its boldest move yet: a $6.5 billion all-stock acquisition of io, the stealth AI hardware startup co-founded by Jony Ive, the man behind the iPhone. It's not just a talent grabit's a statement. With this deal, OpenAI now controls a 55-person elite unit of former Apple NASDAQ:AAPL engineers, designers, and manufacturing veterans, all handpicked by Ive. The goal? Build a new class of AI-powered devices from scratch. Altman called it a crazy, ambitious thing to make. Investors should be paying attention.The collaboration has been brewing behind the scenes for nearly two years. Ive says it feels like everything he's done so far was just preparation for this. Altman? He thinks Steve Jobs would be damn proud. While the duo won't reveal what the product is, they're confident it won't kill the smartphonebut could challenge its role. Their first device is expected to launch in 2026, and early comments suggest it won't look like anything on the market today. If successful, this could redefine how we interact with AImoving beyond screens and into something more intuitive, more human.Apple may not say it out loud, but this has to sting. Ive was once described as Jobs' spiritual partner. Now he's building the next big thingwith someone else. Apple's own AI push has been underwhelming, even leaning on OpenAI's ChatGPT to patch the gaps. That makes this partnership more than just another acquisitionit could be the start of a new device war, where the next iPhone moment belongs to OpenAI.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:8c4a7ef84094b:0-openai-s-6-5b-power-move-jony-ive-is-back-to-reinvent-the-future-of-tech/
Apple vs. HP: Which PC Maker Stock is a Better Buy Right Now?,1747671960000,"Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are well-known personal computer (PC) makers in a market that is expected to see year-over-year shipment growth of 2.1% in 2025, per IDC. Global PC shipment is expected to witness a CAGR of 0.4% between 2025 and 2029 to hit 422.6 million in 2029. Commercial shipment is expected to grow 4.3% year over year to 138 million and witness a CAGR of 0.8% between 2025 and 2029 to hit 142.6 million. Meanwhile, U.S. shipment growth is expected to be 1.7% to hit 70.4 million in 2025, per Canalys. For 2026, the shipment is expected to grow 1.9% to 71.7 million. Commercial is expected to 6.3% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, while consumer is expected to remain flat year over year in 2025 and increase 1.1% in 2026.The growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) powered PCs and Microsoft Windows 10 end-of-service in October 2025 are key catalysts. Gartner expects AI PCs (PC with an embedded neural processing unit) global shipments to hit 114 million units in 2025, a jump of 165.5% from 2024.So, Apple or HP, which is a better buy under the current scenario?The Case for Apple StockApple’s Mac business is benefiting from strong demand for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. In March, Apple expanded its Mac portfolio with the new MacBook Air powered by the M4 chip with up to 18 hours of battery life and a new 12MP Center Stage camera. Apple also announced the new Mac Studio featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The new chip is the most powerful created by Apple and features double Neural Engine cores, Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2 times the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion.Apple’s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in the first quarter of 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 8.7%, up 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 14.1% year over year to hit 5.5 million. According to Gartner, Mac shares inched up 20 bps while shipments increased 7% year over year.The availability of Apple Intelligence globally with macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India, bodes well for Mac’s prospects.The Case for HP StockGrowing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP’s PC sales. The company had earlier suggested that AI PCs could be a key growth driver beginning this year. It forecasted that 40-60% of all PCs will be AI PCs in the next three years. To make the most of the growing opportunities in this category, HP has launched several AI PCs this year and plans to continue to expand its AI PC portfolio.However, HP faces meaningful downside risk if the U.S.-China tariff war escalates. The company relies heavily on China for manufacturing and assembling many of its PCs, printers, and related components. Higher import tariffs on Chinese-made goods would raise HP’s production costs, forcing the company to either absorb the margin pressure or pass on costs to consumers, both negative outcomes.Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.2%, up 20 bps on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of calendar 2025. Shipment grew 6.1% year over year to hit 12.8 million.HPQ & AAPL’s Earnings Estimate Revision Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.39 per share, down 1.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 0.3% increase over fiscal 2025’s reported figure.HP Inc.

Trump Threatens At Least 25% Tariffs on Apple's iPhones Made Outside US,1748010562000,"President Donald Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. This follows Trump's remark from last week that he had asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing in India. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their (iPhones) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""Apple shares fell 2.4% in Friday trading. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a Friday note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives estimate that manufacturing iPhones domestically could raise their price to about $3,500, adding that it would take five to 10 years to shift production to the US. During a quarterly earnings call at the beginning of this month, Cook said he expected the majority of iPhones sold in the US to have India as their source country for the ongoing three-month period, and China to be the country of origin for a ""vast majority"" of product sales outside the US. Cook's comments came as the US and China raised duties on each other's goods. However, Washington and Beijing recently agreed on a 90-day suspension of tariffs. ""We believe (Apple) will continue to navigate this complex tariff situation in a game of negotiations especially heading into iPhone 17 production this fall,"" Ives said Friday. Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on Apple's stock with a $270 price target. Apple in February announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years, including for an artificial intelligence server factory in Texas.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384708:0/

"Apple Stock Faces Major Legal Risks. Here's How Bad It Could Get, Says Analyst. — Barrons.com",1747668360000,"Adam ClarkApple faces a threat to around 20% of its earnings if two legal threats turn out badly for the company, according to Evercore analysts.Apple faces two major risks — the first is the end of the arrangement where it receives billions of dollars annually from Google-parent Alphabet for placement of its search engine on iPhones. The second is litigation with videogame developer Epic Games that threatens its ability to charge a fee on transactions in Apple's App Store.The payment from Google — estimated at $20 billion to $24 billion — is the bigger deal, representing around 6% of Apple's annual revenue but 16% of its earnings per share, according to Evercore's Amit Daryanani.Now the Department of Justice has proposed that Google should be prohibited from providing Apple with ""anything of value"" for search placement as part of an antitrust lawsuit against the search-engine company.""We estimate 50% of the total payment from Google is for U.S. revenue sharing,"" wrote Daryanani. ""The DOJ would not be able to challenge the non-US payments. There is some risk however that Google chooses to simply drop the entire agreement if it is ruled to be illegal in the U.S.""Meanwhile, Apple also risks losing money it earns from charging fees to U.S. app developers, after a California judge recently ruled the company violated a 2021 injunction requiring it to allow app makers to steer users to in-app payment methods not controlled by the company.The total revenue at risk there is an estimated $7 billion, representing 2% of revenue but around 6% of the company's earnings per share, according to Daryanani.Apple has filed an emergency motion to temporarily fend off the ordered changes to the company's app-store policies, and has said it intends to appeal the judge's decision.Adding the two together, a worst-case scenario where the U.S.-related Google payment and app-store fees drop to zero would take out around 20% of Apple's earnings per share. In that case, Daryanani sees the stock dropping to $144. Apple shares were down 1.9% at $207.21 in morning trading on Monday.Importantly however, that is not the Evercore analyst's base-case scenario. He kept a Buy rating on Apple stock with a $250 target price, on the assumption the eventual outcomes won't be as strict as threatened.""We do think investors have become notably negative on Apple and should we see any of the court cases or tariff issues go Apple's way (or be less bad) that could be a sizable positive for the stock,"" Daryanani wrote.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on the EU, Stoking Fresh Trade Tensions — Barrons.com",1748010540000,"By George Glover and Reshma KapadiaPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would impose a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1 and threatened 25% tariffs on Apple iPhones if they weren't made in the U.S., reminding the market that the trade war is still very much on.Trump announced the levies in a post on Truth Social, citing the EU's ""powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies.""He said that he was ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the trading bloc, to take effect June 1. The duties won't apply to any products that are manufactured in the U.S., Trump added.Europe's flagship Stoxx 600 index plummeted after Trump said he would impose the levies. It was down 1.8% at last check. Paris's CAC 40 tumbled 2.8% and Frankfurt's Dax dropped 2.3%. U.S. stocks also fell.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and the European Commissioner For Trade Maroš efčovič are set to speak on a call later on Friday. The European Commission's spokesperson on trade declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment about Trump's Truth Social post.The latest threats come as trade talks have dragged out on multiple fronts and analysts like Owen Tedford at Beacon Policy Advisors has worried that Trump could look to make an example of a token country to pressure other priority countries to commit to some sort of framework agreement faster.""The EU is particularly problematic for the Trump administration because they are not caving to pressure,"" says Henrietta Treyz, head of research at political consultancy Veda Partners. The two sides aren't closer to a resolution on longstanding issues, including standards for agriculture and commodity purchases and a digital services tax.The escalation is similar to the approach the administration tried with China and then walked back with its recent pause. ""He has created an untenable tariff that effectively bans trade between the two nations,"" says Treyz, who expects tariffs on EU to rise, probably to 20% to 30%. ""By threatening 50% today, should he land at 20% or even 30%, it's possible the market sees that as 'de-escalation' and doesn't respond as negatively to the shock.""""Dialing tariffs up or down is one way the administration believes it can bring forth change in global supply chains and trade,"" says Juhi Dhawan, a macro strategist for Wellington Management via email, who expects the tariffs to be a tool used throughout the Trump presidency.The takeaway for investors: The relative calm around trade may have been misplaced. In a client note this morning, Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that container traffic hasn't rebounded after the 90-day pause and roll back on U.S.-China tariffs, a sign that the uncertainty is still paralyzing trade.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Ive also leads io, a company founded last year to design and develop a new family of AI-powered products.As part of an unusual deal announced Wednesday, OpenAI will also acquire io in an all-equity deal that values it at $6.5 billion. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in the company late last year, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI's startup fund also invested at the time.The acquisition of the rest of Ive's io puts an executive who helped change the relationship between consumers and technology at the forefront of development of devices that move consumers away from screens.Io's staff of roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI, while LoveFrom continues to operate independently.OpenAI will be a customer of LoveFrom and LoveFrom will receive a stake in OpenAI, people familiar with the matter said. The companies expect the transaction to close this summer pending regulatory approval.""I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this moment,"" Ive said. Altman said he hopes the team can ""bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit that I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago.""Ive and Altman said in a joint statement that their work together grew out of friendship and collaboration.Altman has taken a number of steps to explore device and hardware options, investing in 2020 in the startup Humane, which launched what it called the Ai Pin with OpenAI's technology that failed to catch on with consumers.Altman has long been fond of Apple and was eager to strike a deal with the iPhone-maker when the company sought partnerships for the rollout of Apple Intelligence about a year ago. He has idolized Apple co-founder Steve Jobs even though Altman has been outspoken in his criticism of smartphones and what he sees as toxic aspects of screen addiction.OpenAI's acquisition of io points to its growing ambitions as a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, who's tasked with helping the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.While much of Ive's work at Apple revolved around the specific look and feel of products in the physical world, he also took greater responsibility for software issues on certain devices toward the end of his tenure there.Write to Keach Hagey at Keach.Hagey@wsj.com and Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521008183:0/
Magnificent 7 Trades at Seven-Year Low Valuation,1747667527000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL and its Magnificent 7 peers hit their cheapest collective valuation in seven years, Goldman Sachs finds. The group trades at a forward P/E of 28 versus 20 for the S&P 493, a 43% premium that sits in the 30th percentile of the past decade. That marks the lowest NTM multiple for Apple, Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Meta NASDAQ:META , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA since 2018, strategist David Kostin wrote. Although concerns around AI spending, trade-policy uncertainty and antitrust lawsuits have driven multiples lower, Goldman's cross-sectional model suggests the cohort is actually trading at a modest discount to its fundamental profile based on earnings growth and balance-sheet strength.In the near term, Kostin says, lighter positioning, relatively cheaper valuations than the past two years and renewed AI enthusiasm after Q1 earnings could propel the Magnificent 7 higher. Yet the risk equation remains two-sided: ongoing U.S. and European antitrust probes into Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta could cast a shadow, and competitive headlineslike Apple's AI-powered search ambitions wiping 7% off Alphabet's share pricehighlight the vulnerability within the peer group.Despite those headwinds, the group's financial health and growth outlook remain robust, with average analyst earnings upgrades for the cohort outpacing the broader market. Investor focus is likely to oscillate between AI-driven upside potential and regulatory overhang, setting up a volatile but opportunity-rich environment for tech-heavy portfolios.Why It Matters: At multi-year lows, the Magnificent 7's valuation reset may offer a buying opportunity for investors seeking exposure to secular growth leaders, but regulatory and competitive risks warrant caution.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:81aac1760094b:0-magnificent-7-trades-at-seven-year-low-valuation/

US markets sink as Donald Trump rekindles trade tensions; Apple drops over 3%,1748008955000,"U.S. stocks slid on Friday after President Donald Trump reignited trade war fears, jolting investor sentiment just as markets were already nervy due to rising bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 359 points, or 0.9 percent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.9 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively — all three ending the week more than 2 percent lower.Among the biggest drags was Apple, which dropped 3.5 percent after Trump proposed a sweeping tariff on foreign-made iPhones sold in the U.S. The tech heavyweight — one of the market’s most influential stocks — was singled out in a social media post where Trump said Apple must manufacture iPhones domestically or face a 25 percent duty.Also read: RBI board approves record dividend transfer of Rs 2.69 lakh crore to Centre for FY25The president also escalated tensions with the European Union, calling trade negotiations “dead” and recommending a blanket 50 percent tariff on EU imports starting June 1, 2025.

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Arista Networks, Apple and Applied Industrial Technologies",1747661160000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 19, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Apple AAPL and Applied Industrial Technologies AIT.Stock Buyback Bonanza: 3 Companies Scooping Up SharesThere are many ways that companies can keep shareholders happy, whether that be through robust financial performance or consistent dividend payouts, just for a few simple examples.Companies can also demonstrate a shareholder-friendly nature through share repurchase programs, also commonly known as stock buybacks.Several companies, including Arista Networks , Apple and Applied Industrial Technologies , recently unveiled fresh buybacks. Let's take a closer look at the benefits and the announcements of each.Benefits of Stock BuybacksStock buybacks, also known as share repurchase programs, are commonly deployed by companies to boost shareholder value.A stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves. Reducing the number of outstanding shares can boost earnings per share (EPS), also helping to put a floor under shares, reflective of consistent buying pressure.Still, it's worth mentioning that buybacks can sometimes bring out critics, as some believe the cash could be better deployed elsewhere, such as R&D. Nonetheless, buybacks are generally a net positive for shareholders, particularly those of mature companies with a much smaller growth runway.ANET Benefits from AIArista Networks' latest set of quarterly results beat our consensus EPS and sales estimates handily, with revenue of $2.0 billion showing nearly 30% growth year-over-year. The company's sales growth has been fueled by the AI frenzy, as the company is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus, and routing environments.The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with EPS expectations increasing across the board. Arista Networks unveiled an additional $1.5 billion repurchase program in the release.Apple Unveils Massive Stock BuybackDown 15% year-to-date, Apple shares have struggled in 2025, underperforming relative to the S&P 500 in a big way and driven lower by initial tariff headlines. Shares faced pressure as a result, but the recent de-escalation announcement between the US and China has brought back positivity.Apple unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting some of its cash to work. The earnings outlook for the tech titan remains under pressure, with analysts taking their EPS expectations lower across the board over recent months.The evolving EPS outlook of Apple is certainly going to be interesting, particularly so amid all the back-and-forth news we've received concerning tariffs and other economic developments. It's worth remembering that the company is no longer the growth machine it used to be, with EPS forecasted to climb 6% on 3% higher sales in its current fiscal year.AIT Generates Serious CashApplied Industrial Technologies exceeded both our consensus EPS and sales estimates, with EPS growing 4% YoY on the back of a 2% sales increase. The company's cash-generating abilities saw a notable boost throughout its latest period, with free cash flow of $115 million up 50% YoY.The cash-generating abilities have allowed the company to sport a shareholder-friendly nature, currently boasting a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. AIT unveiled a new repurchase program to buy up to 1.5 million shares, replacing the prior repurchase plan.Bottom LineCompanies commonly deploy repurchase programs to boost shareholder value, all of which we've recently seen from these companies listed above.All three have been aggressively buying shares over recent years, helping put in a floor while also aiding EPS. Though buybacks are criticized by some, they make great sense for mature companies with little growth left to squeeze.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a97bab227094b:0-zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-arista-networks-apple-and-applied-industrial-technologies/

Dividend Watch: 2 Red-Hot Stocks Boosting Payouts,1747840500000,"Everybody loves dividends, as they provide a passive income stream, limit drawdowns in other positions, and provide more than one way to profit from an investment.And when considering dividend-paying stocks, those with a history of boosting their payout are prime considerations, reflecting their commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.In addition, consistent dividend hikes reflect the company’s successful nature, opting to share profits with shareholders.For those seeking companies that have recently boosted payouts, Apple AAPL and Vistra VST fit the criteria. Let’s take a closer look at each.Apple Keeps Generating CashApple’s latest set of quarterly results came with several positives, including record Services revenue and record EPS for its March quarter. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year throughout the above-mentioned period, with adjusted EPS of $1.65 up 8% from the same period last year.The company’s stellar cash-generating abilities have allowed it to reward shareholders nicely, with the tech titan announcing a 4% boost to its quarterly dividend payout. Apple also unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting even more of its cash to work.The tech titan generated $20.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.Due to its heavy manufacturing exposure in China, the recent de-escalation of trade tensions is a massive positive. Apple previously warned it may pass the higher costs onto consumers through iPhone price hikes, so the recent news is excellent for both parties.Shares jumped on the news, gaining nearly 20% since the announcement.Vistra Increases Payout AgainVistra safely operates a reliable, efficient, power generation fleet of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Shares have been scorching hot over the last year, gaining nearly 70% thanks to demand stemming from the AI infrastructure buildout.The company announced a 3% increase to its quarterly payout, continuing a trend of higher payouts over the years. VST presently sports a 13% five-year annualized dividend growth rate, with its payout ratio sitting sustainably at 12% of its earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s dividends paid on a quarterly basis.Importantly, Vistra reaffirmed its current year guidance in its latest release in early May, providing a big sigh of relief to investors. The Q1 earnings cycle has largely been dictated by commentary for the upcoming periods, and VST cleared the critical hurdle.Bottom LineDividends bring many great perks to investors, such as passive income and the ability to achieve maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.Companies typically boost payouts when business is running smoothly, overall sending a positive message concerning the longer-term picture as well. In addition, consistently higher payouts owe to a company’s cash-generating abilities, undoubtedly a huge positive.And for those seeking companies looking to pay their shareholders a higher paycheck, both companies above – Apple AAPL and Vistra VST – fit the criteria.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1ed91535c094b:0-dividend-watch-2-red-hot-stocks-boosting-payouts/
Trump Just Threatened Apple With a 25% Tariff -- Here's What Could Happen Next,1748008801000,"Donald Trump just fired a shot across Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL bow and markets flinched. In a fiery Truth Social post on Friday, the former U.S. President warned that if iPhones sold in America aren't made on American soil, Apple could be hit with a 25% tariff. Trump claimed he had already told Tim Cook to stop shifting production to India and ""anyplace else,"" suggesting a potential policy reversal if he's reelected.Investors didn't take it lightly. Apple stock sank 3.4% in the premarket trading at 7.49am, dragging Nasdaq (QQQ) futures into the red. The sell-off highlights just how sensitive markets remain to tariff talk especially when it comes to tech giants with deep global supply chains. Despite Apple's multi-billion-dollar U.S. investment pledges, the company still relies heavily on China and has recently ramped up iPhone manufacturing in India a strategic hedge that now faces political headwinds.Apple hasn't commented yet, but the message from Trump is loud and clear: bring jobs back or pay the price. A 25% tariff would hit Apple's margins or force it to pass costs to consumers neither of which would sit well with shareholders. For now, this is just talk. But with the 2024 race heating up and reshoring back in the spotlight, Apple investors may want to start scenario planning.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:17ef80ced094b:0-trump-just-threatened-apple-with-a-25-tariff-here-s-what-could-happen-next/

Fortnite Returns to Apple's App Store in the U.S. — Update,1747839240000,"By Mauro Orru""Fortnite"" is back on Apple's App Store in the U.S. nearly five years after the iPhone maker removed the popular videogame amid a long-running dispute with developer Epic Games.Apple yanked ""Fortnite"" from its app store in August 2020 after Epic Games sought to introduce its own in-app payment system that bypassed a 30% commission that Apple charged on in-app transactions.Apple said it removed ""Fortnite"" because Epic's payments feature violated its policies, while Epic Games countered that Apple collected an unfair cut of revenue. The two companies have been locked in a legal back-and-forth ever since.In a post on X, Epic Games said late Tuesday that Fortnite was back on the App Store in the U.S. for iPhones and iPads, as well as the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union.The reinstatement of the game comes weeks after a federal judge said Apple had violated a 2021 ruling that required the iPhone maker to loosen its restrictions on how developers can seek payment within their apps.The judge, who issued a new order for the company to allow developers to steer users to alternate methods of paying for services or subscriptions offered in the App Store, also took the extraordinary step of referring the matter to federal prosecutors to determine whether criminal contempt proceedings are warranted.Apple said it would comply with that order, though it disagreed with the court's decision which it planned to appeal.Epic Games last week said Apple had blocked the ""Fortnite"" app it had submitted for review. Apple said it had asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to affect ""Fortnite"" in other geographies.On Monday, the same judge that presided over the 2021 case effectively demanded that Apple approve the reinstatement of ""Fortnite"" on the App Store or send a representative to court to prove it had a basis for not doing so, according to court records seen by The Wall Street Journal.Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on the reinstatement of ""Fortnite.""Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521006993:0-fortnite-returns-to-apple-s-app-store-in-the-u-s-update/

Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.,1748007840000,"By Britney NguyenPresident Donald Trump said Apple must pay a 25% tariff if it doesn't rely on domestic production of iPhones for the U.S. marketShares of Apple Inc. were down more than 2% shortly after Friday's open after President Donald Trump threatened the company with a tariff if it doesn't make iPhones for the U.S. market stateside. One analyst called Trump's dream of domestic iPhone production a ""fairy tale.""""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) that I expect their [iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""However, analysts at Evercore ISI said in April they didn't see iPhone production moving into the U.S., ""as the higher labor costs alone would drive a >50% increase in iPhone manufacturing costs"" - double the tariff Trump is now threatening to put on Apple.""This implies that even under a 50% global baseline tariff it would not make financial sense to produce the iPhone domestically,"" Evercore said last month.Earlier this month, the president said he ""had a little problem"" with the Apple chief during a meeting between the two in Qatar. Trump has taken issue with the iPhone maker's further expansion into India. Apple doesn't produce any smartphones in the U.S., but has been diversifying its supply chain away from China since pandemic-era lockdowns and as geopolitical tensions between the two countries have intensified. The company has moved production into countries including India and Vietnam, but the Trump administration is still pushing for the company to bring its manufacturing stateside.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.As Trump floated massive tariffs on goods imported from China earlier this year, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, pointed out that most of the components used in iPhones are made abroad.""If U.S. tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come,"" Ives said in an April note. An iPhone made in the U.S. could cost $3,500, Ives said - more than double the current $1,000 price tag.Ives reiterated his point in a note on Friday, saying that building iPhones in the U.S. ""would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of $3,500 if it was made in the US.""He estimated that shifting production to the U.S. would take between five to 10 years, and called the idea ""a fairy tale that is not feasible.""In April, analysts at Gimme Credit said moving some iPhone production to the U.S. ""cannot be done immediately.""""It would take meaningful time and money to build and develop the physical infrastructure,"" the analysts said. ""More importantly, it is doubtful that the U.S. could provide the necessary labor force, both in terms of quality and quantity.""The analysts noted that Apple would likely still have to import some components from China.India produced about 20% of Apple's iPhones - or more than 40 million devices - in the past year ending in March, according to Bloomberg. The company is now focused on sourcing most of its iPhones sold in the U.S. from India by the end of 2026, the report said.-Britney NguyenThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet",1747832340000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India — and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company's prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Tariff Threats Seen as Increasing Risk to U.S. Credibility — Market Talk,1748007720000,"President Trump's new tariff declaration ""is a destabilizing threat that could do real, lasting damage,"" deVere Group's Nigel Green says in a note. ""Beyond the short-term volatility, there's a bigger risk unfolding: the risk of recession and erosion of US credibility on the global stage,"" he says. The dollar and Treasury yields went up a little after Trump's social media post threatening 50% tariff on the E.U. and 25% on imported iPhones, but remained below yesterday's levels. The 10-year yield is at 4.483% and the WSJ Dollar Index falls 0.5%. The greenback weakens 0.8% versus the yen and 0.3% against the euro.

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

European stocks fall as Trump proposes 50% tariff on EU imports; says talks with them ‘going nowhere’,1748007559000,"President Donald Trump on Friday said he is recommending a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in trade talks with the 27-nation bloc. The proposed tariffs would take effect on June 1 and mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Washington and Brussels.Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “The EU has been very difficult to deal with…our discussions with them are going nowhere!” The announcement came less than 30 minutes after Trump threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones if the company does not begin manufacturing them within the United States.The dual threats reflect Trump’s increasingly aggressive trade posture as his administration races to strike deals before existing global tariff agreements expire in July. Source: Truth SocialBrussels awaits scheduled call between EU and US trade representativesThe European Commission declined immediate comment, saying it would await the outcome of a scheduled call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, set for 15:00 GMT. The call is expected to be tense, as Greer reportedly plans to inform Sefcovic that recent EU proposals fall well short of US expectations.The timing of Trump’s announcement surprised many in Brussels. Just weeks earlier, the US had agreed to a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs, offering both sides time to negotiate. That truce was meant to stabilize markets following Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcement on April 2, which had already roiled investors by introducing a 20% tariff later revised down to 10%.Currently, EU exports to the US are only subject to the new “baseline” tariff. A shift to 50% duties would represent a dramatic departure and potentially provoke retaliatory measures from Europe.Market reaction swift and negativeThe financial fallout from Trump’s statement was immediate. European stocks fell sharply, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.9%. Germany’s DAX dropped 2.3%, France’s CAC 40 fell 2.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 lost 1.3%.Sectors most vulnerable to global trade volatility were hit hardest. Banking stocks sold off heavily, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale losing 6% and 5.5% respectively. Italian lender Unicredit was down 4.2%. The regional Stoxx Banks index slumped 3.6% as investors assessed the indirect risks to lenders from a potential economic downturn triggered by tariffs.Consumer cyclical and luxury goods sectors were also under pressure. Swatch Group and Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica were each down about 5%.Bond markets, a typical haven during uncertainty, saw increased demand. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell 8 basis points to 2.56%, while yields on French, Italian, and Swiss bonds also declined.Bond yields move inversely to prices, meaning investors were moving money into safer assets.Economists warn of stagflation risksCommenting on the potential consequences of such high tariffs, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said, Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box , Goolsbee warned the tariffs could create a “stagflationary” scenario by increasing production costs and slowing output, all while raising consumer prices. “That’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” he added.The EU was the second-largest buyer of US goods in 2022, importing nearly $351 billion worth of American products. A 50% tariff could severely impact transatlantic trade flows and unsettle multinational corporations relying on open trade channels.Trump’s broader strategy remains unclearThe Trump administration is currently in talks with over a dozen governments in an effort to renegotiate trade deals before automatic tariff resets take effect in early July. However, several foreign officials have expressed concern over Washington’s unpredictable demands, noting the difficulty in making concessions when tariffs can be reimposed without warning.Trump has long argued that European nations benefit disproportionately from trade with the United States. His push for “reciprocal” tariffs seeks to align duty rates, though critics say such measures risk igniting full-blown trade wars and undermining global supply chains.With less than two weeks remaining until the proposed 50% tariff would take effect, attention now turns to upcoming discussions between US and EU trade officials. A failure to find common ground could deepen the rift between two of the world’s largest economic blocs.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:5bb71649d094b:0-european-stocks-fall-as-trump-proposes-50-tariff-on-eu-imports-says-talks-with-them-going-nowhere/
"AI Agents Face One Last, Big Obstacle — WSJ",1747483200000,"By Steven RosenbushSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — The race to build useful artificial-intelligence agents that can perform complex actions for people is moving on to a new set of challenges.The large language models at the core of these agents are good enough for many tasks. But there is a growing emphasis on connecting the LLMs inside agents to a plethora of tools that they will need to get their jobs done.An advanced LLM might fail at complex multiplication, for example, while the cheapest, oldest model can ace the test if it has a calculator tool.But there is another hurdle: Agents will need permission to access apps, APIs and websites if they are ever going to call an Uber or book a flight, the kind of expectation that has been established over the past year.Humans type passwords or use facial and fingerprint recognition to sign into their accounts, but AI agents require new methods of authorization to address the intermediary role between humans and the services they want to use, according to Alex Salazar, chief executive of startup Arcade.dev.The promise of agentsIn a recorded presentation shown at Apple's developer conference last June, one of the company's machine-learning and AI leaders shared a hypothetical example in which she asked Siri to tell her when her mom's flight was going to land. Siri would cross-reference flight details that her mom emailed with real-time flight tracking to determine an up-to-date arrival time.Next, she imagined that she wanted Siri to tell her the details of lunch plans with her mom, which Siri would ascertain by checking her calendar or text messages. And it would figure out how long it would actually take to get to lunch from the airport.Apple has yet to deliver, but the AI ecosystem is working on the ""plumbing"" that will make such complex AI agents possible.The effort got a boost last November when Anthropic, the startup behind the chatbot Claude, introduced an open-source standard known as Model Context Protocol. ""Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools,"" the user guide says.""Tool-calling agents are the emerging phase of agent AI development,"" Salazar told me. His 12-person startup on the outskirts of San Francisco is developing tools to tackle getting agents signed into websites, APIs and apps.The company, which Salazar co-founded last year with Chief Technology Officer Sam Partee, announced in March that it had raised $12 million of seed funding in a round led by Laude Ventures with participation by Flybridge Ventures, Hanabi Capital and the venture capitalist Andy Rachleff.Adoption curveGetting agents all the necessary tools and access is a significant obstacle.Device manufacturers will likely start integrating AI agents with core applications such as email and calendars, according to Salazar. As agents expand to other services, he said they would work best with companies that have public application programming interfaces, the bits of code that help one application connect to another. Some platforms deliberately limit API access to prevent abuse, and some older systems lack APIs.But that integration of AI agents and apps via existing authorization protocols could also be the last major challenge.Salazar says simple, low-risk AI agents work right now, and they will take on increasingly complex, high-risk tasks over the next two years. For example, Arcade is helping a customer, Shortwave, connect its AI email agent to other apps such as knowledge-management tool Notion, according to Shortwave co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Lee.AI agents over the next 24 months will increasingly draft communications and plan itineraries for people but still require human confirmation before final execution, Salazar predicts. After that point, he expects that fully autonomous agents will be allowed to operate, beginning with easy, low-risk tasks.Once the key engineering problems around agents are overcome, Salazar says, the world is poised for a new technological shake-up in the way things get done. The introduction of app stores in 2008 abruptly and broadly changed the norms by which people interact with the world. AI agents could be very close to triggering something just as big.Write to Steven Rosenbush at steven.rosenbush@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250517000659:0/
Google AI Advances Cheered by Wall Street. Why the Stock Reaction Is a Different Story. — Barrons.com,1747825740000,"By Adam ClarkGoogle-parent Alphabet unveiled a flurry of artificial-intelligence features at its developers conference. While analysts were impressed, the stock market still seems worried about how AI might eat into the company's core search market.The headline announcements on Tuesday included the introduction of ""AI mode"" to Google's search engine for U.S. users and a premium AI subscription. That came alongside many features such as 3-D video calls, real-time language translation and digital assistants, as well as a new line of smart glasses.Alphabet shares were up 0.3% at $164.54 in premarket trading after falling 1.5% the previous day. However, Wall Street analysts said the event showcased the company's strength in AI development.The conference ""reoriented investors back to first principles, i.e., AI success requires a combination of engineering, infrastructure, and distribution, and Alphabet is well positioned across these areas,"" wrote KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson in a research note Wednesday.Patterson has an Overweight rating and $195 target price on Alphabet stock.Google said its ""AI Overviews"" feature has 1.5 billion monthly users and the evidence is that users shown such summaries subsequently use its search engine more frequently.""We believe these enhancements will resonate with users and attract advertisers through higher quality leads and improved monetization potential,"" wrote CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.That could help calm some fears about declining usage, triggered earlier this month when an Apple executive testified in a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google that searches in the iPhone maker's browsers fell for the first time in April.""Google is about to go through a tricky time as doubters call into question its search business, and there is a possibility that its shares get hit hard if the numbers wobble before getting back on track,"" wrote independent analyst Richard Windsor.

"Apple Will Continue to Balance Politics, Business While Preparing for iPhone 17 Launch, Wedbush Says",1748007155000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL will continue balancing politics and business as it prepares for the launch of iPhone 17 later this year despite push from US government to produce gadgets locally, Wedbush said in a note Friday. Following Foxconn's recent announcement to invest $1.5 billion in a new iPhone production facility in India, US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would impose a 25% tariff on Apple if the company continues producing iPhones outside the US, especially in India, according to the note. Trump stated he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook that iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically, the investment firm said. Despite Apple's $500 billion investment in US-based AI projects, analysts say it is unrealistic to shift iPhone manufacturing to the US soon due to high costs and logistical challenges, Wedbush said. Experts estimate that making iPhones in the US would drive retail prices to around $3,500, making the plan financially unworkable, Wedbush analysts noted. During Apple's March earnings call, Cook revealed over 50% of US-bound iPhones are now made in India, and this could increase to 60%-65% by fall, Wedbush noted.

Fortnite Returns to Apple's App Store in the U.S.,1747821420000,"By Mauro Orru""Fortnite"" is back on Apple's App Store in the U.S. nearly five years after the iPhone maker removed the popular videogame amid a long-running court dispute with developer Epic Games.Apple yanked ""Fortnite"" from its app store in August 2020 after Epic Games rolled out a new way of making in-game purchases that bypassed a 30% commission that Apple charged on in-app transactions.Apple said it removed ""Fortnite"" because Epic's payments feature violated its policies, while Epic Games countered that Apple collected an unfair cut of revenue.

Review & Preview: A Car Play in A Trade War — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Ian SalisburyShares of online car retailer Carvana rallied some 5% on Tuesday after CEO Ernie Garcia argued that tariffs could boost used-car sales. Analysts agree: They expect Carvana's operating profits to more than double in 2025 and jump another 25% in 2026.But Carvana's high share price, at 58 times expected 2025 earnings, already reflects that optimism and requires a lot to go right in uncertain times. Investors might do better with another stock with a much cheaper valuation: Group 1 Automotive, which rallied 1.2% to more than $448 on Tuesday after Citigroup's Michael Ward raised his target price to $495 from $463.Group 1 owns more than 330 auto franchises. Wall Street sees relatively modest profit growth: 3.8% in 2025, 6.6% in 2026. But shares trade at less than 11 times 2025 earnings. About 50% of Group 1's revenue comes from new-vehicle sales, compared with 33% for used vehicles, notes CFRA. If tariffs steer shoppers toward used cars instead of new ones, that could cut into Group 1's biggest market.Still, Ward notes, 25% of Group 1's revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where U.S. tariff plans mean little. He says its multiple could expand as memories of the Covid-era industry's dislocations fade.

The broader decline in Chinese exports to the U.S. was 21% in the same period.The sharp fall followed a U.S. tariff increase on Chinese imports to 145%, which triggered a retaliatory move by Beijing imposing 125% duties. Although Washington and Beijing reached a temporary truce later in May, key disagreements remain unresolved, including U.S. sanctions on Huawei's AI chip production.The total U.S.-China trade volume stood at $690 billion in 2024. Smartphones, lithium-ion batteries, and laptops were among the top imports into the U.S. from China.India, Apple's main production base outside China, is playing a growing role in offsetting these losses. Shipments of iPhone components from China to India have nearly quadrupled over the past year. In April, Apple's Indian suppliers exported nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the U.S., a record figure.

Apple (AAPL) Faces Trump Pushback Over India Manufacturing Shift,1747428341000,"Apple (AAPL, Financials) came under scrutiny Thursday as President Donald Trump said he urged CEO Tim Cook to halt product manufacturing in India and prioritize U.S.-based production instead.Trump, citing a little problem with Cook, said he reminded the Apple chief of the company's $500 billion U.S. investment pledge and expressed dissatisfaction over Apple's ongoing expansion in India. Apple currently assembles around 90% of its iPhones in China but is planning to shift about 25% of that production to India in the coming years.Trump also stated that Apple may increase its U.S. manufacturing efforts, although he offered no details. The president's remarks align with recent White House trade measures, including a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian imports, temporarily lowered until July. India, in response, has offered to drop tariffs entirely on U.S. goods, Trump said.Meanwhile, Apple's main Indian assembly partner, Foxconn, received clearance to build a semiconductor plant in partnership with HCL Group. The move highlights Apple's broader diversification strategy, which includes exploring production in Vietnam as well.Experts say bringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could result in steep price increases. Estimates place the cost of a domestically built iPhone between $1,500 and $3,500. Currently, Apple's only major U.S.-made hardware is the Mac Pro. The company also recently announced a Texas facility for AI server production.The pressure from Trump introduces political and economic tension into Apple's global supply chain strategy, with potential implications for both production costs and market positioning.Investors will be watching how Apple balances political pressure with supply chain resilience and whether it makes further concessions toward onshore manufacturing.- See insider trades for AAPL. - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:a5ba37090094b:0-apple-aapl-faces-trump-pushback-over-india-manufacturing-shift/

Apple Just Unlocked Its AI Brain--And Developers Could Strike Gold,1747773384000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL is about to hand the keys to its AI engine over to developersand it could be the smartest move it's made in years. At WWDC on June 9, the tech giant is expected to unveil a new SDK and frameworks that let third-party developers build AI features directly on top of Apple's own language models. For now, these are the smaller models that run locally on devices, not the heavier, cloud-based ones. But even this step could unleash a wave of creativity that Apple desperately needs in its push to stay relevant in the AI race.Why now? Because Apple Intelligencethe platform that was supposed to mark Apple's generative AI erahasn't exactly lit the world on fire. Developers had limited hooks to work with, and many turned to external solutions like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's TensorFlow. Meanwhile, apps like Claude and Grok are already thriving on the App Store. Apple knows this game: when it opened up iOS to app developers in 2008, it created an entire economy. Now, it's betting that giving developers direct access to its own AI models could do the samethis time for AI.There's more coming. Apple is also prepping a unified operating system experience across iPhone, iPad, and Macunder the codename Solariumand plans to drop new features like an AI-powered battery mode and a virtual wellness coach (coming 2026). On the business side, Apple still earns a slice of subscription revenue from App Store apps, but that pie is shrinking as regulators force open payment pathways.

Apple has been the worst Big Tech stock lately. Here's why investors are missing the big picture.,1748089800000,"By Laila MaidanApple's stock has sold off on tariff fears, but the company has a healthy business underpinned by a sticky ecosystem and robust array of services offeringsOne thing Apple users can agree on is that it's hard to imagine trading an iPhone or a MacBook for a Samsung smartphone or a Lenovo laptop. That's probably the biggest thing Apple has going for it amid the tariff noise.Yet Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) has been under pressure lately. As large technology stocks have roared back in May, Apple shares have missed out. The stock is down 8% so far this month. It's the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" that's in the red over that period, according to FactSet data. It's also the worst-performing stock of the bunch on a year-to-date basis, down 22%.Friday's tariff-related scare added to the pain. Apple's stock closed 3% lower to clinch its eighth loss in a row.Don't miss: Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.But even as President Donald Trump threatened Apple on Friday with a 25% tariff if it didn't bring its manufacturing into the U.S., analysts aren't flinching and don't think investors should either. But that point comes with a caveat that's like a pilot telling passengers they're about to experience some turbulence. That's true, too, of Apple's stock. The short-term ride might be unpleasant, but arrival is still on time. So, if you're already invested, it's probably not a good idea to get off midflight.That said, over a three- to five-year timeframe, there's a lot of reason to be confident in the company's growth prospects because the products are part of an admirably sticky ecosystem, according to Gil Luria, the head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. His view is that the services tacked on to Apple's hardware products will keep customers coming back. It's also true that many who buy one Apple product, like an iPhone, tend to buy another, like a MacBook, Luria noted. In short, the recent stock weakness isn't a statement on the health of the business. It's more of a relationship issue between Trump and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.""If you get to a point where the president is posting in such a confrontational manner, that means the negotiation isn't going well,"" said Luria.It's a setback, but it's not bad enough to send Luria back to his model to rework his outlook for the company. While an additional 25% tariff would hurt the company's profitability, he believes there's still a chance that negotiations between Apple and the White House could stave off the worst. If Apple products did take an additional 25% tariff hit, that would hurt earnings in the nearer term. However, the costs could be spread out by partially raising prices and passing some costs along to parts suppliers, Luria said. Additionally, Apple wouldn't be at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as Trump noted that Samsung (KR:005930) and other makers of smartphones would also be slapped with 25% tariffs on devices made overseas as they're imported to the U.S.Ask the Moneyist: Is now a good time to buy an iPhone?Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, chuckled and called the tariff threat ""noise,"" adding that it doesn't impact how he views Apple. ""I don't think you can take too much away from these headlines,"" he said. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that Cook's relationship with the president isn't as strong as it may once have been, he noted. Under the first Trump administration, Cook was able to secure a tariff exemption.Valuationwise, Apple's stock is trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, below its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. But Apple could see the slowest sales growth among the group, with a two-year estimated compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.1% through 2026. What that all means, said Luria, is that, despite slowed sales, investors still have a lot of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Apple's stock trades at a premium compared with the S&P 500 SPX, which has a forward P/E of 21.2 and a two-year estimated sales CAGR slightly above Apple's at 5.6%. Meanwhile, Apple's forward P/E is slightly below that for the S&P 500 information-technology sector, which stands at 26.8. Yet the IT sector has a two-year sales CAGR more than double Apple's, at 11.3%.Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, says Apple's bigger problem is that Siri's integration with Apple Intelligence has fallen behand. The company is at risk of losing market share to any contender able to release life-changing generative AI services. That's something Mortonson believes could happen through Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pixel phones or through Google's partnership with Samsung Galaxy and the integration of generative AI into that smartphone.That risk means he wouldn't suggest investors be overweight the stock, and he believes a stock like Alphabet is a better bet given its cheaper forward P/E at 17.3 with a two-year estimated sales CAGR double Apple's, at 10.7%.The next important event for Apple will be its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 9. The company will have a chance to wow customers with any updates, particularly on Apple Intelligence. But until then, Luria believes, he said, that investors should suspend judgment about the stock.Overall, investing is based on an individual's risk tolerance. While Apple is still seen as a solid company, and a good stock to own, there may be better risk-reward opportunities elsewhere. As for investors who already own the stock because they like the company and believe in the business's long-term prospects, panic selling based on negative headlines is never a good strategy. Instead, investors should focus on the company's key drivers. And a big one right now is how well Apple can compete in generative AI services because that will help drive hardware sales and increase demand for Apple's services segment, including cloud storage.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"“No chance” iPhones can be made in the US, analysts say — options Apple could explore instead to tackle tariffs",1748073600000,"Apple is staring down a major supply chain and pricing dilemma after President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the United States unless the tech giant begins manufacturing the devices domestically. Trump’s remarks, posted on Truth Social and reiterated later to reporters at the White House, are the latest escalation in his push for US-based production by large multinationals.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote, warning that otherwise “a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.”The president’s comments come as Apple has been ramping up production in India, seeking to diversify away from its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing amid rising geopolitical tensions and pandemic-era disruptions. CEO Tim Cook recently said more iPhones sold in the US would be made in India, a shift that may now be politically fraught.Analysts say iPhone making in the US unfeasible; say threat a negotiation tacticApple shares dropped almost 3% on Friday trading following Trump’s post, falling to $195.44. The prospect of steep tariffs raised concerns across financial markets, with analysts warning of significant cost implications and logistical hurdles should Apple try to comply.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimated that manufacturing iPhones in the US could push retail prices to $3,500, a dramatic increase from today’s average $1,000. “We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,” Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Morningstar analyst William Kerwin echoed those sentiments, describing domestic iPhone manufacturing as unfeasible in the medium term. “To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater US investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone,” he said.Potential strategies for Apple under tariff threatFaced with this new pressure, Apple may explore various strategies to blunt the impact of a potential tariff hike.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring suggested that Apple could cut less profitable models from its iPhone lineup, focusing instead on higher-margin units to reduce the blow. A “targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,” Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.Another option floated by analysts involves stretching the product release cycle. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple could switch from an annual to a biennial launch schedule, simplifying supply chains and production timelines.Apple may also decide to confront the administration directly, publicly tying higher prices to Trump’s trade stance. One proposal discussed in analyst circles is for Apple to add a “tariff surcharge” to each US sales receipt, making consumers aware of how much more they’re paying because of the new tariffs.Constraints that limit Apple’s US productionFor now, most analysts agree that relocating iPhone production to the US is impractical. Apple’s manufacturing relies heavily on China-based partner Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers and taps into a dense web of suppliers, logistics firms, and engineers—none of which are easily replicable in the US.“The idea of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said, adding that even if the company decided to pursue the move, it would take five to ten years to make it a reality.The challenges are not new. In 2011, when President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the US, Jobs reportedly replied, “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” referring to Asia’s unmatched industrial infrastructure and labour scale.Some of Apple’s suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, are expanding US operations under pressure. However, Foxconn appears unlikely to significantly boost its American footprint. The firm scaled back a highly publicized $10 billion Wisconsin plant and has instead committed $1.49 billion to its India operations.Likely bearing of 25% tariff on Apple’s earningsUBS analyst David Vogt estimated that if a 25% tariff were applied to 70 million iPhones annually imported from China and India, Apple’s earnings per share could take a hit of about $0.51. Wall Street currently expects Apple to earn $7.18 per share this fiscal year.As pressure mounts from Washington, Apple is left navigating a volatile mix of political demands, economic realities, and consumer expectations. Whether Trump’s threat is a hard policy shift or a negotiation tactic, it has already forced a reckoning over the limits of globalization and the fragility of tech supply chains.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:669d8abeb094b:0-no-chance-iphones-can-be-made-in-the-us-analysts-say-options-apple-could-explore-instead-to-tackle-tariffs/
'Tariff Man' Is in a Bad Mood Ahead of the Memorial Day Weekend — Barrons.com,1748004300000,"By Martin BaccardaxJust when you thought it was safe to go back into the water.Stocks haven't had a great run this week and were on pace for their biggest five-day slide since the ""Liberation Day"" lows in early April. But with the S&P 500 just 5% from its all-time peak, Nvidia earnings just around the corner, and the bond market settling from its recent tantrum, you could make a solid case for optimism heading into the Memorial Day weekend.And then it happened.President Donald Trump, fresh from hosting a controversial dinner for well-heeled meme coin investors last night at his Mar-a-Lago residence, took to his social-media platform and fired off two messages that touched on his go-to theme: tariffs.Likely reacting to a report that Apple was looking to expand its India-based supply chain, Trump warned the tech giant would face a 25% levy if the iPhones it sells in the U.S. aren't made in the U.S.Trump, who in 2018 said he was a 'Tariff Man,"" followed that missive with a threat to impose a ""straight 50%"" tariff on imports from the European Union, citing what he has long claimed are unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, and the targeting of American companies by the region's competition authorities.Markets reacted in kind, taking a sleepy pre-long weekend premarket into another roiling tariff casino, with futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 now suggesting a near 100-point slump for the benchmark.The market's benchmark volatility gauge, the CBOE Group's VIX index, surged more than 15% to 24.09 in the wake of the president's remarks, suggesting traders are now expecting daily swings of 1.5%, or 88 points, for the S&P 500, a 37.5% increase from earlier this week.The merits of the president's case are, for the most part, besides the point at this stage, and markets have largely stopped debating the veracity of his claims or the impact that his threats might have on growth prospects in the world's biggest economy.What they can't ignore, however, is the impact they're likely to have on corporate profits, be it in terms of Apple's bottom line or that of the myriad U.S. companies that rely on overseas sales to drive overall earnings.They also can't discount the fact that corporate leaders, try as they might, aren't able to insulate their companies from this tariff-theme wroth.Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many others, donated to the president's inauguration fund and attended the event in Washington, sitting near to Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon.com Chairman Jeff Bezos, and unveiled a massive $500 billion U.S. investment plan in late February.It hardly seems to matter now.Apple stock was down 3.1% in premarket trading, a pace that would drag one of the world's most valuable companies deeper into bear market territory.Investors, meanwhile, will be left hanging into the early spring holiday, with the S&P 500 at risk of losing a big chunk of its hard-fought May gains as another round of tariff angst, alongside recession worries, inflation pressures, and a bond market freakout adding to the rising wall of worry.For a man who enjoys a round of golf as much as he does, Trump sure knows how to ruin a good Memorial Day weekend.Write to Martin Baccardax at martin.baccardax@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tim Cook's Bad Year Keeps Getting Worse — WSJ,1748052000000,"By Rolfe WinklerFor Tim Cook, the hits keep coming.On Friday, President Trump targeted Apple with new demands that the company make iPhones in the U.S., threatening 25% tariffs if the company doesn't comply. ""Rise and shine Tim Cook,"" Trump whisperer Laura Loomer posted on X, reminding the Apple CEO he is at the center of the president's trade bull's-eye.That is just one of the threats Cook has confronted in what has appeared to be a no good, very bad year for Apple. Aside from Trump, Cook is facing off against two U.S. judges, European and worldwide regulators, state and federal lawmakers, and even a creator of the iPhone, to say nothing of the cast of rivals outrunning Apple in artificial intelligence.Each is a threat to Apple's hefty profit margins, long the company's trademark and the reason investors drove its valuation above $3 trillion before any other company. Shareholders are still Cook's most important constituency. The stock's 25% fall from its peak shows their concern about whether he — or anyone — can navigate the choppy 2025 waters.What can be said for Apple is that the company is patient, and that has often paid off in the past.This past week, a key architect of the iPhone, Jony Ive, joined OpenAI to develop a next-generation device that weans consumers off screens. After he announced a deal to sell his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported that a key goal is to deliver an AI-powered device that shifts the current computing paradigm in which humans stare at black rectangles all day. Later, OpenAI told employees it is aiming to make 100 million AI ""companion"" devices.It is hard to gauge the potential for a brand-new computing device from a company that has never made one. Yet the fact that it is coming from the man who led design of the iPhone and other hit Apple products means it can't be dismissed. Apple sees the threat coming: ""You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as that sounds,"" an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified in a court case this month.Apple isn't expected to show any AI breakthroughs at its annual developer conference in a couple of weeks. And Cook said on Apple's recent earnings call that a more personalized Siri assistant hasn't arrived yet because what the company has in the shop doesn't yet meet Apple's ""high quality bar.""The company might not need to be first in AI. It didn't make the first music player, smartphone or tablet. It waited, and then conquered each market with the best. A question is whether a strategy that has been successful in devices will work for AI.Apple makes billions in revenue from its services business, carrying gross profit margins north of 70%, compared with less than 40% for hardware. A judge wrote in a recent ruling that Apple ignored her injunction to allow app developers to bypass its steep fees on app store purchases. ""Cook chose poorly"" in listening to advice to ignore her, she wrote. European Union regulators want Apple to make similar changes abroad, and worldwide regulators could follow suit.State and federal lawmakers are threatening the app store with legislation to require Apple to verify user ages. While the bottom-line impact of such a move is unclear, it could reduce teen spending or even empower parents to limit teen engagement on smartphones more fully.Meanwhile, the judge overseeing an antitrust case against Alphabet's Google could demand that the search giant stop paying Apple some $20 billion annually to be the default search engine in Safari, revenue that is basically pure profit for Apple.Of course, all of these issues pale next to threats to Cook's greatest creation — Apple's supply chain in China.Trump's demands notwithstanding, there isn't much Apple can do to move iPhone production, which remains centered in China. While it is shifting final assembly of more iPhones to India, many of the components inside the device still come from across the Himalayas.The strategy gives Apple some flexibility to arbitrage different tariffs for U.S.-bound devices assembled in the two countries.Trump wants a made-in-America iPhone. Such a device could cost over $3,000, so he is unlikely to get one.Cook might try to placate him by shifting production of something else to the U.S., and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent may have given Cook an out on iPhones when he said Friday that the administration wants Apple to make more of its chips here.Apple already announced plans to facilitate production of AI servers in Texas, but Trump clearly expects more. With frequent calls to the White House and a meeting there in the past week, Cook, it seems, is negotiating his next peace offering.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009759:0/

How to Protect Your Retirement Savings — Barron's,1748050200000,"Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions — about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. ""This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,"" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio — whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive — owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of ""American exceptionalism"" — the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live — and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor — until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund — one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech — including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. ""If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,"" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestlé, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too — if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash — the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. ""You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,"" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The ""real,"" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age — 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later — and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy.

Trump threatens Apple with 25% tariffs over foreign iPhone production; shares fall,1748003211000,"Apple’s decision to expand its manufacturing footprint in India has triggered a sharp response from US President Donald Trump, who warned on Friday that iPhones sold in the United States must be made domestically—or face heavy tariffs. The warning marks a new escalation in Trump’s global tariff strategy, directly targeting one of the world’s most valuable companies.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”The move marks Trump’s first direct trade threat against a single company, setting a precedent for potential future action against other multinationals who rely heavily on overseas production.Apple shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading after the post, dragging down broader market sentiment.Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped by 112 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures both declined by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Source: Truth SocialTrump’s warning follows report about Foxconn’s $1.5bn plant in IndiaThe president’s statement comes on the heels of reports about Apple’s key supplier, Foxconn’s plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new component plant near Chennai, India, further entrenching the country’s position in Apple’s global supply chain. According to a Financial Times report, the plant will assemble iPhone display modules, which play a vital role in the touchscreen interface and visual quality of the device.Two Indian government officials told FT that the facility, located in Tamil Nadu’s Oragadam industrial region, has already received clearance from local authorities. It is expected to create around 14,000 jobs and become one of the largest electronics-sector investments in the country.Foxconn disclosed the investment via a filing on the London Stock Exchange this week, noting that the funds will be routed through its Indian subsidiary, Yuzhan Technology India.Currently, Apple manufactures around 85% of its iPhones in China, with India accounting for roughly 15%. The company has been slowly increasing its Indian production share, partly to diversify its supply chain away from China amid rising geopolitical risks and to leverage India’s more favourable trade ties with the United States.Escalation of frustrationTrump’s threat follows a more measured statement he made last week on the same issueAt an event in Qatar last week, Trump revealed that he had directly confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company’s growing operations in India, despite its pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said. “I told him: ‘Tim, you’re my friend. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.”He accused Apple of taking advantage of preferential treatment in the US while concentrating its manufacturing overseas, especially in China. “We’ve treated you really good,” he said. “Now you got to build for us.”The high costs of Apple’s US manufacturingDespite political pressure, shifting iPhone assembly to the United States remains economically challenging. Industry analysts estimate that relocating production would cause labour costs to skyrocket—from $290 per month per worker in India to about $2,900 under US wage laws. This would increase the cost of assembling each device from around $30 to $390.Such a move could slash Apple’s profit per iPhone from $450 to just $60 unless the company raises its prices. Some estimates suggest that building the devices entirely in the US could push the retail price to nearly $3,000—three times the current price point.This cost disparity has long been a key reason for Apple’s international production strategy. While India offers relatively lower costs and improving infrastructure, bringing manufacturing stateside would be financially unsustainable without a significant increase in retail prices or a dramatic reduction in margins.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:87ff0993a094b:0-trump-threatens-apple-with-25-tariffs-over-foreign-iphone-production-shares-fall/

Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold the AAPL Stock?,1747762800000,"Apple AAPL next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver’s screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available. Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.

Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024. The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple’s vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple’s Prospects?Although Apple’s business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple Inc.

Up & Down Wall Street: The Stock Market Had a Bad Week. It's Your Fault. — Barron's,1748050200000,"By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your "" big, beautiful bill,"" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index — a measure of market strength — to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.""Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,"" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.""We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,"" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. ""And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.""One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year — and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests ""growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,"" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending — and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs ""quality"" stocks. ""Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,"" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time. Then again, that's not really the point.""In the end, the goal of disaster planning is to allow you to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs,"" Colas writes.Otherwise, we have no one to blame but ourselves.Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523009449:0/

Will Nvidia Stock Keep Rebounding as Q1 Earnings Approach?,1748036940000,"With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA less than a week away, the chip giant’s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia’s big tech peers utilizing the company’s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let’s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28. Nvidia’s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company’s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia’s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion. Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia’s new AI venture, Humain. Nvidia’s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia’s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia’s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4. NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia’s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April.  Monitoring Nvidia’s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500’s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it’s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X.  Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia’s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant’s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1c74f2903094b:0-will-nvidia-stock-keep-rebounding-as-q1-earnings-approach/

Tim Cook Called Texas Governor to Stop Online Child-Safety Legislation — WSJ,1748036400000,"By Rolfe Winkler, Amrith Ramkumar and Meghan BobrowskyApple stepped up efforts in recent weeks to fight Texas legislation that would require the iPhone-maker to verify ages of device users, even drafting Chief Executive Tim Cook into the fight.The CEO called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week to ask for changes to the legislation or, failing that, for a veto, according to people familiar with the call. These people said that the conversation was cordial and that it made clear the extent of Apple's interest in stopping the bill.Abbott has yet to say whether he will sign it, though it passed the Texas legislature with veto-proof majorities.In the weeks leading up to its passage, Apple hired more lobbyists to pressure lawmakers. An interest group it funds targeted the Austin, Texas, area with ads saying the legislation is ""backed by porn websites."" Google also finances the interest group and is fighting the legislation. The law's supporters say adult-content sellers don't favor it.Texas would be the largest state to adopt what is called an app-store accountability law. Similar laws have been proposed across at least nine states and adopted in one, Utah. Federal legislation also has been introduced. Meta Platforms — along with social-media companies X and Snap — also have played a role in the lobbying fight, advocating that what is known as ""age-gating"" should be the responsibility of app stores rather than individual apps.The Texas bill is turning heads because its success in the second-biggest state with a Republican legislature could foreshadow adoption across the country, potentially creating new costs for Apple and Google, as well as for some app makers.The law requires those running app stores, primarily Apple and Google, to verify the age of a device owner. If the owner is a minor, their app-store account would have to be tied to a parent's account. The parent would be notified when their child wants to download an app and have to approve or deny the download.Proponents argue that such laws will give parents more control over their children's use of smartphones, and that children aren't legally allowed to agree to apps' terms of service in the first place.Critics say such a law could impose costs on a swath of apps whose content isn't controversial. They also say the bills are allowing Meta and other apps to shunt responsibility for online safety onto others.One reason the laws are being crafted to have app stores verify ages, and not individual apps that are viewed as problematic, is that the latter approach would likely be struck down on free speech grounds, say those who have helped shepherd the bills.Meta has 13 lobbyists working in Texas, according to the state's Ethics Commission. Apple has six and Google has seven.An Apple spokesman said that the company wants to strengthen online safety for children but that the Texas bill threatens user privacy. ""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" he said.Meta has said that verifying ages at the app store-level is easier and helps preserve privacy, by only having children's ages stored in one place instead of on every app they access.A spokesman for Abbott said ""safety and online privacy for Texas children remains a priority for Governor Abbott. The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk.""The age-verification bills are the latest threat to Apple's lucrative apps business. Last month, a judge forced the company to allow app developers to avoid Apple's steep commissions on app-store sales, a move the European Union is also pushing for.It is also the latest sign that Cook is playing a personal role lobbying for the company. When it comes to tariffs, he is known to call President Trump directly to advocate for the company's position. He was spotted visiting the White House on Tuesday. He also personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.Apple lobbyists successfully blocked a similar effort in Louisiana last spring, but that bill has returned this year and is advancing.Some states are moving ahead with app-store bills anyway.""The more we can help parents understand what their children are really interacting with and give them tools to help them make good parenting decisions, then I think we're all better off,"" said Angela Paxton, the Texas state senator who sponsored the legislation.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com, Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523005634:0/

Apple Ignores Trump Over Indian iPhone Plan. Why That's Probably Smart. — Barrons.com,1747754580000,"By Adam ClarkApple looks to be driving ahead with its plans to assemble iPhones for the U.S. market in India, despite President Donald Trump's opposition to the move. It's a risk, but a sensible one for the company.Apple is increasing production of iPhones in India in a bid to diversify its production away from China in response to the tariffs Trump has imposed on China. Trump has publicly criticized the move, saying he had ""a little problem"" with Apple CEO Tim Cook and calling on the company to build in the U.S. instead.The latest evidence is that Apple isn't changing its mind, despite Trump's comments and a temporary tariff truce between Beijing and Washington.India's Tata Electronics has begun assembly of iPhone 16 products at its facility in the city of Hosur, according to a Tuesday report from local newspaper The Economic Times. Meanwhile, Apple's supplier Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, said in a filing on Monday that it would invest $1.49 billion in its India unit.It is hard to imagine Apple's partners going ahead with such plans without guarantees that the company will stick to a significant increase in Indian production. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on Trump's remarks or its plans in India.Apple shifting production might look a little odd at the moment, considering India is facing a potential 26% tariff on imports to the U.S., while levies on Chinese goods have been temporarily slashed to 30%. The shift risks the wrath of the president while also incurring significant costs — $900 million for the June quarter, according to Cook.On the other hand, having both India and China as significant bases should give the company flexibility to split production of its iPhones for the American and global markets depending on what tariff agreements are reached.""We believe that Apple could ramp iPhone assembly production in India up to 60%-65% by the Fall in a best case scenario but could easily pivot back to a China driven iPhone strategy depending on the tariff situation and deal negotiations,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a recent research note.Ives estimates that making an iPhone in the U.S. would probably lead to a retail price of around $3,500 compared with around $1,000 currently, saying that it would take years to build the production capacity that would make that possible.Ives kept an Outperform rating and $270 target price on Apple stock.

"Trump Threatens Fresh Tariffs on EU, iPhones and Rival Devices — WSJ",1748034900000,"By Gavin Bade, Meridith McGraw and Rolfe WinklerWASHINGTON — President Trump fired new salvos in the global trade war on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on imported goods from the European Union and new duties on iPhones and other smartphones made overseas.Trump said the EU had been ""very difficult to deal with"" on trade in a Friday morning social-media post. Less than a half hour earlier, he threatened Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, with a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones made overseas.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" he wrote on Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.Later on Friday, in Oval Office comments, Trump said those tariffs will include ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair."" Trump appeared to be referring to companies that manufacture smartphones outside of the U.S. He added that the tariffs would likely be imposed in late June.The threats build on the president's effort to pressure CEOs to move more manufacturing to America and punish allies whose trade policies the White House argues are unfair. Cook met with Trump at the White House this week, according to a White House official.The White House didn't immediately provide additional comment. Apple declined to comment. An EU representative declined to comment. Apple shares declined 3% on Friday.Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU imports, which was later paused for 90 days to allow for negotiations. A 10% baseline levy remains, and some specific EU products, like cars, are subject to higher tariff rates.The U.S. president has long criticized European nations on trade, and he said in his Friday morning social-media post that trade discussions with the bloc had made little progress. ""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!"" he wrote. He said the 50% tariff would go into effect on June. 1.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he is ""not looking for a deal."" Minutes later, he said the EU likely wants an agreement to avoid the tariffs, and added, ""We're going to see what happens, but right now it's going on on June 1."" Trump listed Europe's nontariff barriers, regulations and lawsuits against U.S. firms as prime irritants driving his threat.European officials had expressed cautious optimism in recent days that talks were progressing after the two sides exchanged documents outlining some of the trade issues they are seeking to discuss. However, they acknowledged they remain far apart in their positions.The EU has been unwilling to move on some of Trump's demands, particularly the value-added tax, which the administration views as an unfair trade practice, but EU Economy Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said the tax is off the table in negotiations. This week, Dombrovskis needled the Trump team at a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting by saying their trade deals would be a ""suboptimal"" outcome for the global economy and suggesting that U.S. allies had to compromise with the U.S. on trade language in a joint statement.EU Trade Commissioner Maroš efčovič spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, hours after Trump's initial threat. In a social-media post after the call, he said the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, but added that trade between the U.S. and EU ""must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.""""We stand ready to defend our interests,"" he added.During the meeting of finance ministers in Canada this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told EU officials they have a ""collective action problem,"" warning that progress on reaching a trade deal with Europe had slowed because each nation has different priorities for an agreement, according to a U.S. official.Bessent on Friday hit out at Europe again, saying on Fox News that ""with the exception of the EU, most [nations] are negotiating in good faith.""Last week, Trump chided Cook for Apple's plans to shift final assembly for many U.S.-bound devices to India, and he reiterated his demands that the company bring manufacturing back to America. He called the CEO his ""friend,"" but suggested that Apple's plan to invest some $500 billion in America wasn't enough.Bernard Arnault, CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, this week urged European lawmakers to take a more pragmatic, deal-focused approach to trade negotiations with the U.S.""The United States is the No. 1 market in the world,"" Arnault told French senators during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. ""It's very important for Europe to reach an agreement with the United States. As of now, it seems to me things are off to a bad start.""Arnault, who first met Trump when the two men were real-estate developers in New York in the 1980s, also warned against adopting a confrontational tone.""If we threaten him — if we say, for example, 'We're coming in and we're going to take this or that measure,' or, 'We no longer want our companies to invest in the United States' — we'll get the opposite result,"" Arnault said.After Trump raised tariffs on goods made in China, Apple accelerated its effort to make most U.S.-bound iPhones in India. Such a move would allow it to claim India as the ""country of origin"" and pay the lower duties facing that nation.Bessent, in his Friday interview with Fox, said the administration is trying to persuade Apple to build semiconductors in the U.S.""I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities...is this external production, especially in semiconductors. A large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors,"" Bessent said. ""We would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Bessent said he met with Cook this week.Technology experts have said that while shifting some iPhone manufacturing to America is possible, building the full stack of iPhone components and assembling it in the U.S. would be challenging and costly. IPhones contain a patchwork of sophisticated parts, sourced from many countries and put together primarily in China. America doesn't have facilities that resemble the infrastructure developed in China, nor does it have skilled manpower to assemble iPhones at that scale.Apple shares declined slightly more than the market, but not to an extent that indicates investor concern that the company would be subject to the 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones. ""The market is obviously concluding that this is just a negotiation,"" said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.He said he expects the eventual outcome for Apple will be for the company to make some additional components in the U.S., but not iPhones themselves.Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com, Meridith McGraw at Meridith.McGraw@WSJ.com and Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523004234:0/

Wall Street Declines After Trump's Fresh Tariff Threats; Apple Falls 3%,1748033993000,"US benchmark equity indexes declined on Friday as President Donald Trump's tariff threats against the European Union and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL refueled concerns about a trade war.

Among sectors, technology saw the biggest drop, while utilities paced the gainers. The three benchmarks are down more than 2% each this week. US markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Trump recommended a 50% tariff rate on the EU, effective June 1, saying that talks with the bloc had stalled. The announcement has ""reignited"" concerns about a transatlantic trade war, ING Bank said. Separately, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares declined 3%. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a client note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""""Today's announced threat may be a goad to European leaders to negotiate more quickly with the US,"" Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report. ""In any case, the news reiterates our cautious guidance of recent weeks, namely, that new tariffs (and, as today, threats of tariffs) remain material risks to financial markets, especially when the announcements come as surprises.""US Treasury yields were lower, with the 10-year rate decreasing 4.4 basis points to 4.51% and the two-year rate losing nearly one basis point to 3.99%. Deckers Outdoor NYSE:DECK shares sank 20%, the worst performer on the S&P 500. The footwear and apparel company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Despite being strong, the results were overshadowed by sales growth deceleration at its Hoka sneaker brand and potential demand weakness from price increases, KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a client note. KeyBanc lowered its rating on Deckers' stock to sector weight from overweight. Workday NASDAQ:WDAY shares slumped nearly 13% on Friday, the second biggest drop on the S&P 500. The cloud human resources company late Thursday logged better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and issued a subscription revenue outlook for the ongoing three-month period that matched Wall Street's estimates. Intuit NASDAQ:INTU was the best performer on the S&P 500, up 8.1%. The financial technology platform late Thursday posted fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded the Street's estimates.

"US stocks slip at open: S&P 500 down 0.3%, Dow Jones flat",1747748896000,"US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500’s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody’s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors “buy the dip”Retail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody’s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan’s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET—the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index’s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody’s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump’s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The “buy-the-dip” approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities—a new monthly record—highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:e5cd031ef094b:0-us-stocks-slip-at-open-s-p-500-down-0-3-dow-jones-flat/

"Stocks Fall on Tariff Broadside, After Week of Bond Market Agita — WSJ",1748032860000,"By Matt WirzThe markets started the week with fears of a deficit crisis and ended with renewed angst over tariffs.President Trump renewed his tariff campaign Friday, threatening to impose a 50% rate on the European Union and warning Apple that foreign-made iPhones could face significant levies. Shares of Apple lost 3%, while broader stock indexes finished the day lower by 0.6% to 1%. The S&P 500 index ended the week down 2.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite both fell 2.5%.""I'm not so worried about the stock action,"" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management. ""A 2% to 3% drop is just normal trading compared to what investors have gotten used to in the last couple of months.""More worrying is the steady rise in Treasury bond yields since Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. government and the House of Representatives passed a tax bill that could add to the country's large budget deficit.The 30-year Treasury bond yield finished the week at 5.036%, its highest level since 2023, while the 10-year yield ended the week at 4.508%, about the same as its high point during the worst of the market turmoil in April. Bond yields rise when prices fall. In contrast, the S&P 500 is still about 16% above its lowest point in April.Stock investors are relatively sanguine because ""they now know that Trump will pivot on trade,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, referring to the president's softer stance since late April. Stock prices would have dropped far more dramatically had Trump made his comments about Europe in March, he said. ""The market has finally figured out not to overreact to every salvo.""Still, the fresh tariff threats from the White House are aimed at core pillars of global commerce: one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. European stocks fell about 0.9% and investors sought shelter in haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, weighing on the dollar. Gold prices rallied.Senior U.S. and EU trade officials held a prearranged call on Friday, with neither side changing its position significantly in comments afterward. G-7 finance and central bank chiefs issued a vague statement Thursday that made no mention of levies, and only one mention of ""trade, "" after a summit that featured both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and EU representation.On Apple, Trump said in a Friday post that he has told Apple CEO Tim Cook ""that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.""Elevated Treasury bond yields indicate that traders are also worried that diminishing demand for U.S. government bonds will increase the country's borrowing costs. That would bring knock-on effects on large and small businesses by raising the cost of corporate loans and slowing economic activity.In another cause for concern, the value of the dollar is dropping even as bond-yields rise. That could indicate the U.S. currency is losing some of its appeal as a haven for foreign savers and corporations.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250523008752:0/

Tesla Stock Drops as Trump Tariff Threats Take Focus Off Magical Thinking — Barrons.com,1748032020000,"Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it ""deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,"" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid ""the federal regulatory spiderweb.""""The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,"" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe.

Apple Is Unlikely to Escape Tariffs This Time. Trump Is Doubling Down. — Barrons.com,1748031480000,"By Adam Clark and Angela PalumboApple stock was dropping on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the U.S.""I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump said in a post on social-media platform Truth Social early on Friday.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president wrote.The president doubled down on his post in a meeting at the White House on Friday, where he told reporters that not only would he put tariffs on Apple if they don't move production to the U.S., but he would also place levies on Samsung and other smartphone products makers who import to the country to ensure fairness. He added that those tariffs would potentially start at the end of June.""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs,'"" Trump added.While tariffs are paid by the importer of record at the time the goods enter the country, economists generally agree that the increased costs are passed on to suppliers and consumers.In an interview with Fox News Friday morning, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he thinks one of the country's ""greatest vulnerabilities is this external production, especially in semiconductors, and a large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors, so we would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.""Apple shares fell 3% to $195.27 on Friday. The stock has now fallen 22% this year, compared to the 1.3% decline of the S&P 500. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Owen Tedford, an analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors, says the Apple tariff threats could be tied to the levies expected out of the administration's Section 232 investigations into certain sectors.""It would suggest that Trump is at least considering not giving the company an exemption from the duties,"" Tedford said. Apple was exempted from tariffs during Trump's first term in office. ""It also implies that there is at least some consideration to cover electronics devices as part of the [Section 232] tariffs that were expected to primarily hit semiconductors.""These sector-oriented tariffs are expected to be stickier but the timing still isn't still clear, especially as the administration tries to strike trade agreements with various countries related to its April 2 blitz of tariffs.As companies and countries await trade decisions from the president, Apple has already started making changes. It's increasing production of iPhones in India in a bid to diversify its production in response to the tariffs Trump has imposed on China, previously the main hub for the company's smartphone production. Trump has publicly criticized the move, saying he had ""a little problem"" with Apple CEO Cook and calling on the company to build in the U.S. instead.The Wall Street Journal reported that Cook met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday, citing a White House official. Apple has already committed to investing more than $500 billion and hiring around 20,000 people in the U.S. over the next four years, although it unclear how much of that sum is new.The threatened 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured overseas is still likely to be considerably less than the cost of producing 'made in USA' devices. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has estimated that making an iPhone in the U.S. would probably lead to a retail price of around $3,500 compared with around $1,000 currently, and it would take years to build the necessary production capacity.""We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,"" Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Ives isn't alone in this belief. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin wrote in a research note on Friday that he doesn't think iPhone production in the U.S. is ""feasible in the medium term.""""To us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater U.S. investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone.""Among other electronics like semiconductors and personal computers, Apple's products are temporarily exempt from the hefty reciprocal tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. However, Apple recently said it's already taking a financial hit from tariffs. CEO Tim Cook told analysts that shipping devices sold in the U.S. from India and Vietnam, rather than China, would add about $900 million to the company's costs for the June quarter in the company's earnings call earlier this month.Investors have been trying to figure out how much of an impact tariffs could have on Apple's top and bottom lines. UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in a research note on Friday that ""if a 25% blanket tariff is applied to 70M annual iPhones imported into the U.S. from China and India, we estimate the annual EPS headwind would be $0.51."" Wall Street currently expects Apple to generate earnings of $7.18 in the current fiscal year.India is facing a potential 26% tariff on imports to the U.S., which has been suspended while trade talks take place, while levies on Chinese goods have been temporarily slashed to 30%.A few of Apple's key suppliers, such as chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, are expanding their U.S. operations under the threat of tariffs.However, its key manufacturing partner Foxconn — formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry — looks unlikely to follow suit, having already sharply scaled back plans for a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin which was announced in 2017. Foxconn said in a filing on Monday that it would invest $1.49 billion in its India unit.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com and Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Tech stocks took a hit after the last two U.S. credit downgrades. Why this time could be different.,1747689240000,"By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The U.S. Lost Its Perfect Credit Rating. Who Still Has It. — Barrons.com,1747687980000,"By Anita HamiltonThe U.S. lost its top credit rating from Moody's over the weekend, but 11 other countries still have it.Those countries are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland.Companies also get rated by Moody's, which provides a globally recognized standard of creditworthiness. Among them, Apple, Johnson & Johnson, and Microsoft have a top credit rating too, along with government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy mortgages from lenders.Moody's global long-term rating scale is designed to reflect the risk that an entity — be it a company, a country, or financial vehicle such as mortgage-backed securities — will be able to meet financial obligations a year or more in the future.Those with the top rating, Aaa, are considered minimal risk, while the lowest, C, ""are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal and interest,"" according to Moody's.In downgrading the U.S. to Aa1 Friday, Moody's noted the ""increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.""Markets were closed Friday night when Moody's adjusted its rating for the U.S. After falling initially Monday morning, major indexes closed slightly up, with the Dow rising 0.3% and the S&P 500 up 0.1%.

Tim Cook to Donald Trump: You Were Serious About That? — Barrons.com,1748030880000,"By Ben RoseAbout the author: Ben Rose is president of Battle Road Research, an independent equity-research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook's response to President Donald Trump's made-in-America push calls to mind a scene in the movie My Cousin Vinny. Vincent Gambini (played by Joe Pesci), a novice defense attorney, is scolded by Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) for showing up in his Alabama courtroom without a suit and tie, with the judge taking particular offense to Gambini's long leather jacket. When Gambini returns to the courtroom for his next appearance he is dressed the same way, but this time the judge holds in him contempt of court. Gambini, in disbelief, says to the judge: ""You were serious about that?""While Apple was entirely — some might say miraculously — spared from tariffs during Trump's first term, the president has vowed that now ""no one gets off the hook,"" not even America's most valuable company by market capitalization. And this time, he is serious. Apple will need to move some of its production to the U.S.During the first Trump administration, many U.S. companies that manufactured their products in China faced a 25% tariff. Some companies responded by moving production to other low-labor-cost countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to avoid the tariff penalty. Even though it had received an exemption, Apple, no doubt mindful of the growing tension between Washington and Beijing, began to move a portion of its iPhone production to India, in an effort to diversify its supply chain and manufacturing.At the start of the president's second term, companies were unsure whether the president's goal was to negotiate better trade deals, reduce reliance on China, or move more manufacturing back to the U.S. This time around, Apple wasn't going to take any chances. Just 35 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Apple unveiled plans to invest $500 billion (with a b) in the U.S. over the next four years to construct new manufacturing facilities, AI data centers, create 20,000 new jobs, and establish a manufacturing academy focused on workforce training.Having taken public steps to satisfy the president's wishes, Apple's executives likely breathed a further sigh of relief when U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on April 13 that computers and semiconductors would receive a 90-day reprieve from the president's scorching level of 145% tariffs on goods from China. Apple and others would be subject to a separate set of tariffs to be determined at a future date. Perhaps calculating that Trump's ultimate goal was simply to move manufacturing out of China, Apple announced a significant expansion of its production operations in India, presumably with the view that the president would not mind where its iPhones are made — so long as they are not made in China.But like Vincent Gambini, Tim Cook is learning the hard way that the president is serious about Apple making its products in the U. S. — ASAP — rather than potentially taking its sweet time by further expanding production in India.The pushback from Apple and others is that labor rates in the U.S. will make their products uncompetitive in the U.S., with some suggesting American-manufactured iPhones would cost U.S. consumers as much as $3,500.Apple is at least partially right, since labor costs in China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region are a fraction of what they would be in the U.S. In addition, Apple has invested billions of dollars in China, and has nurtured a reliable supply chain that meets its rigorous quality standards. Moving production to India or the U.S. is likely to result not only in higher costs, but a reduction in product quality. As a practical matter, not all of the components in Apple's products are made in America. So what is a practical solution to this standoff?Back to Vincent Gambini and Judge Haller. Following the judge's order, Gambini shells out the money to buy a brand new suit and tie, and thus satisfy the judge's edict to look ""lawyerly"" while defending his clients in the judge's courtroom. Apple's response might be to shell out the money to build or lease final assembly facilities in the U.S., while utilizing at least some amount of U.S.-based content, as well as contract manufacturers. It could also outsource prototyping, production, and bridge manufacturing to local companies that would welcome the work. In doing so, Apple would save a bundle on transportation costs from the Asia Pacific region, while at the same time demonstrate a good faith effort to more rapidly increase manufacturing and high tech jobs in the U.S. Otherwise, like Gambini and the judge, it will find out just how serious Trump was all along.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

That drop compounds pressure on Alibaba, whose quarterly revenue recently came in below consensus as iPhone sales in China slid 2.3% in the quarter ended March 29.The proposed partnership, first announced by Alibaba Chairman Joseph Tsai in February, would have Alibaba's AI powering Siri-style features on iPhones sold within China's tightly regulated market. Apple has been exploring similar tie-ups with Baidu NASDAQ:BIDU and even weighed deals with ByteDance, Tencent (TCEHY) and startup DeepSeekbefore ruling DeepSeek out for lack of scale. U.S. officials fear the arrangement could expose sensitive data or bolster a Chinese firm's global ambitions, potentially derailing Apple's broader AI rollout.For Alibaba, this latest regulatory headwind comes amid a broader slowdown: revenue growth has decelerated as the company grapples with stiff competition from Xiaomi (XIACF), Huawei and a softening e-commerce environment. The stock's recent 15% drawdown from its year-to-date peak underscores investor unease around regulatory risk and execution challenges in its core markets.Why It Matters: A stalled AI partnership with Apple could delay Alibaba's push into high-margin services, while raising fresh doubts about U.S.China tech cooperation and Alibaba's near-term growth outlook.Analyst sentiment on Alibaba Group Holding is showing subtle strain. While the total number of ratings edged up to 44, the number of Underperform calls jumped to 7more than triple the previous months. At the same time, Buy ratings dipped to 14, their lowest in five months. This shift suggests growing caution despite a still-broad base of support.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:91ac4507e094b:0-alibaba-tumbles-as-apple-ai-pact-faces-scrutiny/

Trump's Tariff Threat Just Shattered the Bond Market -- Is Stagflation Back?,1748029511000,"The bond market just blinkedand it wasn't a small twitch. President Trump's latest tariff threats, including a proposed 50% hit on EU goods and a 25% levy on certain Apple NASDAQ:AAPL products, jolted short-term yields lower on Friday. The 2-year dropped to 3.90%its lowest since early Maywhile traders rushed to price in a scenario with two potential Fed rate cuts by year-end. But that short-end optimism is masking a bigger concern simmering under the surface.BlackRock's Russell Brownback called it straight: The curve has evolved into a stagflationary outcome. Translation? Investors are bracing for the double whammy of sluggish growth and stubborn inflationexactly the type of environment that could tie the Fed's hands. The 30-year yield briefly fell to 4.97% before snapping back to 5.04%, yet it now sits a full percentage point above the 5-yeara gap we haven't seen this wide in more than three years. JPMorgan's NYSE:JPM Jamie Dimon echoed the anxiety earlier this week, warning that stagflation isn't off the table given the toxic mix of geopolitics, deficits, and price pressures.And here's the kicker: America's fiscal credibility is cracking. The House just greenlit a tax bill expected to balloon the deficit by $3.8 trillion. Moody's reacted by stripping the U.S. of its last AAA credit rating. Investors, spooked by future borrowing needs, are demanding more compensation to hold long-term debtthe 10-year term premium is now nearing 1%, a level last seen in 2014. For now, Brownback suggests staying in the front and belly of the curvewhere you still catch decent yield, minus the long-end volatility that's about to get a lot messier.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:cd463e309094b:0-trump-s-tariff-threat-just-shattered-the-bond-market-is-stagflation-back/

Services, which generated $96.17 billion in fiscal 2024 (up from $85.2 billion in 2023), is Apple's fastest-growing segment, and any erosion could materially damp growth.Evercore's Amit Daryanani notes that Safari search volume fell in April for the first time everan ominous sign for ad-revenue sharingand that the DOJ's push to force Google to divest its Ad Manager and Exchange could further squeeze Apple's cut. On the App Store front, the judge ordered third-party payment options on iOS, threatening that ~$7 billion in annual fees; if fully lost, Daryanani says EPS could slide 6%, though he expects a smaller actual impact. Evercore still sees upside: it argues the Epic decision may be overturned on appeal as an unjust seizure of private property and maintains an Outperform rating with a $250 price target.Why It Matters: With Services now over $96 billion and growing faster than hardware, any shake-up from these cases could dent Apple's valuation multiple and investor expectations.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:284254d25094b:0-apple-risks-27-billion-in-services-revenue-evercore-says/
Apple (AAPL) Faces Trump Tariff Threat Over Overseas iPhone Production,1748029412000,"President Donald Trump on Friday warned Apple (AAPL, Financials) it must manufacture iPhones in the United States or face a 25% tariff on imports, escalating tensions over the company's production shift to India.Apple could see steep cost increases if forced to reshore production. Trump's comments followed recent meetings with CEO Tim Cook, where he objected to Apple's plans to manufacture U.S.-bound iPhones in India.Apple reported that roughly 90% of iPhones are still produced in China despite ongoing diversification efforts. The company warned investors it could incur $900 million in tariff-related costs this quarter alone, driven by shifting production from China to India.According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, moving even 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S. would cost $30 billion and take at least three years. Fully reshoring could require five to ten years and push iPhone prices to around $3,500 per unit due to high domestic labor and infrastructure costs.Trump's broader tariff plan includes a 10% universal tariff and a reduced 30% tariff on most Chinese goods, down from 145% earlier in the month. Electronics, including iPhones, were previously exempt from higher tariffs, but Apple's India plans appear to have reignited Trump's ire.Apple has committed $500 billion to U.S.-based initiatives in 2025, including a server facility in Houston and expanded data center capacity to support its AI product suite, Apple Intelligence. Despite this, large-scale chip manufacturing remains dependent on Asian supply chains, although some Apple chips are now being produced at a TSMC plant in Arizona.Analysts say reshoring is logistically unfeasible. Wedbush reiterated that full domestic production is a fairy tale, noting the complexity of replicating Asia's supply ecosystem.Investors should monitor potential pricing changes in Apple's next iPhone release this fall and watch for any formal tariff implementation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:6c644746f094b:0-apple-aapl-faces-trump-tariff-threat-over-overseas-iphone-production/
Wall Street Goes 24/7? Kraken's Bold Plan to Tokenize Tesla and Apple Shocks Markets,1747942921000,"Kraken is gearing up to change how global investors access U.S. stocksby putting them on the blockchain. The U.S.-based crypto exchange will soon launch ""xStocks,"" tokenized versions of over 50 popular equities and ETFs, including Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA , Apple NASDAQ:AAPL , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA , and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). These tokens will trade 24/7 on the Solana blockchain and initially be available to users in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africaexcluding the U.S. Kraken says this model could streamline access for investors who've long dealt with clunky settlement systems and high fees through local brokerages.Each xStock will be backed 1:1 by the underlying asset, held and managed by Kraken's partner, Backed Finance. The tokens are redeemable for cash value, and the company hopes this will help keep pricing aligned with real-time market movements. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi noted that traditional cross-border investing is still burdened by friction, and this could be a more cost-effective workaround. If it works, tokenized stocks may not just give international investors easier accessthey might also open up new use cases like pledging tokenized Tesla shares as collateral for DeFi strategies.It's not the first time someone's tried this. Binance launched a similar product in 2021, only to shut it down after regulatory pushback. Kraken is taking a different route, actively engaging with regulators across various countries. The timing also aligns with broader conversations in Washington around crypto and tokenization.

"US Equity Indexes Mixed as Moody's Sovereign Rating Cut Sends Treasury Yields Higher, Dollar Lower",1747674238000,"US equity indexes traded mixed while government bond yields jumped and the dollar weakened as investors reacted to Moody's downgrade of the United States' sovereign credit rating late last week. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.1% to 19,188.1, and the S&P 500 was up less than 0.1% at 5,959.2 after midday on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 42,779.1, after trading slightly lower earlier in the session. Energy, technology, and communication services led the decliners intraday. After the market closed on Friday, Moody's lowered the US government's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Aa1 from Aaa and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The cut reflected increased government debt and interest payment ratios to levels significantly above sovereigns with a similar rating in over a decade. Its move follows a downgrade from S&P Global Ratings in 2011 and Fitch Ratings in 2023. Both have AA+ as the US credit rating. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's sweeping tax-cut bill reportedly passed a key congressional hurdle on Sunday after four holdout Republican conservatives allowed it to move forward. Reuters reported non-partisan analysts said the bill would add $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the US debt over the next decade. US debt now stands at $36.22 trillion, just about doubling in the past 10 years alone, Stifel said in a note. Citing the Congressional Budget Office, Stifel expects debt to rise to over $59 trillion in the decade ahead. The ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's performance against the world's major currencies, slumped 0.7% to 100.43. Gold futures increased 1.5% to $3,235.51 per ounce. Moody's downgrade confirms that fiscal health issues remain significant, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note Monday. Debates around related government policies will likely intensify over the next three months, especially as Congress attempts to reconcile the budget, extend tax cuts, and increase the debt ceiling. ""The US Treasury market remains the largest and most liquid in the world, and we anticipate no imminent change to the importance of the US Treasury market to global investors,"" the WFII note said. US Treasury yields jumped intraday. The US 10-year was up 4.8 basis points to 4.49%, after hitting 4.54% earlier in the day.

Apple vs. HP: Which PC Maker Stock is a Better Buy Right Now?,1747671960000,"Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are well-known personal computer (PC) makers in a market that is expected to see year-over-year shipment growth of 2.1% in 2025, per IDC. Global PC shipment is expected to witness a CAGR of 0.4% between 2025 and 2029 to hit 422.6 million in 2029. Commercial shipment is expected to grow 4.3% year over year to 138 million and witness a CAGR of 0.8% between 2025 and 2029 to hit 142.6 million. Meanwhile, U.S. shipment growth is expected to be 1.7% to hit 70.4 million in 2025, per Canalys. For 2026, the shipment is expected to grow 1.9% to 71.7 million. Commercial is expected to 6.3% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, while consumer is expected to remain flat year over year in 2025 and increase 1.1% in 2026.The growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) powered PCs and Microsoft Windows 10 end-of-service in October 2025 are key catalysts. Gartner expects AI PCs (PC with an embedded neural processing unit) global shipments to hit 114 million units in 2025, a jump of 165.5% from 2024.So, Apple or HP, which is a better buy under the current scenario?The Case for Apple StockApple’s Mac business is benefiting from strong demand for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. In March, Apple expanded its Mac portfolio with the new MacBook Air powered by the M4 chip with up to 18 hours of battery life and a new 12MP Center Stage camera. Apple also announced the new Mac Studio featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The new chip is the most powerful created by Apple and features double Neural Engine cores, Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2 times the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion.Apple’s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in the first quarter of 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 8.7%, up 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 14.1% year over year to hit 5.5 million. According to Gartner, Mac shares inched up 20 bps while shipments increased 7% year over year.The availability of Apple Intelligence globally with macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India, bodes well for Mac’s prospects.The Case for HP StockGrowing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP’s PC sales. The company had earlier suggested that AI PCs could be a key growth driver beginning this year. It forecasted that 40-60% of all PCs will be AI PCs in the next three years. To make the most of the growing opportunities in this category, HP has launched several AI PCs this year and plans to continue to expand its AI PC portfolio.However, HP faces meaningful downside risk if the U.S.-China tariff war escalates. The company relies heavily on China for manufacturing and assembling many of its PCs, printers, and related components. Higher import tariffs on Chinese-made goods would raise HP’s production costs, forcing the company to either absorb the margin pressure or pass on costs to consumers, both negative outcomes.Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.2%, up 20 bps on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of calendar 2025. Shipment grew 6.1% year over year to hit 12.8 million.HPQ & AAPL’s Earnings Estimate Revision Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.39 per share, down 1.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 0.3% increase over fiscal 2025’s reported figure.HP Inc.

And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. ""The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,"" Ive said in the merger announcement video.""Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'"" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. ""Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.""The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An ""AI device"" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, ""you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.""So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it ""The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now."" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"Apple May Need to Change Course on Price, Supply Chains Amid Renewed Trump Rhetoric — Market Talk",1748024880000,"Apple has sought to avoid the brunt of tariff pressures by shipping iPhone products to the US from India and Vietnam, but it hasn't been enough to placate President Trump. Trump said today iPhones manufactured abroad could face import taxes of at least 25%, noting he expects the devices to be made in the U.S. and not in China, India, or elsewhere. ""Given the deal with China, Apple will have been hoping that tensions with the US government would begin to ease, but this has appeared to be a false dawn,"" says Quilter Cheviot's Ben Barringer.

"Apple Stock Faces Major Legal Risks. Here's How Bad It Could Get, Says Analyst. — Barrons.com",1747668360000,"Adam ClarkApple faces a threat to around 20% of its earnings if two legal threats turn out badly for the company, according to Evercore analysts.Apple faces two major risks — the first is the end of the arrangement where it receives billions of dollars annually from Google-parent Alphabet for placement of its search engine on iPhones. The second is litigation with videogame developer Epic Games that threatens its ability to charge a fee on transactions in Apple's App Store.The payment from Google — estimated at $20 billion to $24 billion — is the bigger deal, representing around 6% of Apple's annual revenue but 16% of its earnings per share, according to Evercore's Amit Daryanani.Now the Department of Justice has proposed that Google should be prohibited from providing Apple with ""anything of value"" for search placement as part of an antitrust lawsuit against the search-engine company.""We estimate 50% of the total payment from Google is for U.S. revenue sharing,"" wrote Daryanani. ""The DOJ would not be able to challenge the non-US payments. There is some risk however that Google chooses to simply drop the entire agreement if it is ruled to be illegal in the U.S.""Meanwhile, Apple also risks losing money it earns from charging fees to U.S. app developers, after a California judge recently ruled the company violated a 2021 injunction requiring it to allow app makers to steer users to in-app payment methods not controlled by the company.The total revenue at risk there is an estimated $7 billion, representing 2% of revenue but around 6% of the company's earnings per share, according to Daryanani.Apple has filed an emergency motion to temporarily fend off the ordered changes to the company's app-store policies, and has said it intends to appeal the judge's decision.Adding the two together, a worst-case scenario where the U.S.-related Google payment and app-store fees drop to zero would take out around 20% of Apple's earnings per share. In that case, Daryanani sees the stock dropping to $144. Apple shares were down 1.9% at $207.21 in morning trading on Monday.Importantly however, that is not the Evercore analyst's base-case scenario. He kept a Buy rating on Apple stock with a $250 target price, on the assumption the eventual outcomes won't be as strict as threatened.""We do think investors have become notably negative on Apple and should we see any of the court cases or tariff issues go Apple's way (or be less bad) that could be a sizable positive for the stock,"" Daryanani wrote.Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Cramer is worried about Apple: here’s why,1747935537000,"Famed investor Jim Cramer reveals he is worried about Apple, a stock that he has owned for more than a decade. Cramer is worried that Apple is losing easy revenue through regulatory tussles, geopolitical pressure, and OpenAI’s latest move. Apple in April lost its crown as the most valuable company in the world, with its market capitalisation declining beneath Microsoft.Nvidia also raced past the iPhone maker’s valuation as Apple is now trading as the third most valuable company with a $3 trillion valuation. In its Q2 results, the company’s earnings beat estimates, though iPhone sales plunged 10%. On Thursday, Apple shares were down 0.13%, and the stock is down 17% in the year so far.Losing easy moneyCramer points out that the first big problem for Apple is losing $20 billion from Google due to the antitrust case against Google’s parent company, Alphabet. Alphabet reportedly pays Apple $20 billion annually to make sure Google is the default search engine on iPhone and iPad. In the US antitrust case against Google for its monopoly in the search engine market.While Cramer said Apple could make the money by other methods, like charging other search platforms, the “Alphabet deal was $1 a share in easy profits that could go away”, he said.Legal strugglesApple’s legal case with Fortnite maker Epic Games is another area of concern for Cramer. Apple’s battle with Epic Games over app store payments could cause another 30-cent departure in the company’s earnings per share, Cramer noted. Recently, a federal judge slammed Apple over non-compliance with opening up its app store to alternative payment methods. The judge had ruled that the Cupertino-based company stop charging commissions on payments made outside Apple’s payment system. Apple charges a 30% commission on payments made on its App Store.The Fortnite game is now available on the Apple store, five years after Apple kicked it out. Trump factorApple’s plans to diversify its production from China to India is also facing a potential roadblock with US President Donald Trump wanting more. Trump recently criticised Apple’s decision to build in India. Trump wants Apple to manufacture in the US, which would cause a 13 times increase in manufacturing costs. The move would reduce Apple’s margins from its flagship product from $450 to just $60 if prices are not raised. Cramer flags this also as a problem, as making iPhones in the US could erode “one of the great American triumphs to rival smartphone maker Samsung, a Korean company”, he said.He says that without Trump’s blessing lot of havoc would happen against Apple. The host of CNBC’s Mad Money also said the US regulators are looking into Apple’s recent deal with Alibaba.Cramer said this partnership was the best source of new business for Apple in China. He adds that these deals, which were once seen as an American strength, are now viewed as US weakness and a boost for China.OpenAI threatOpenAI’s recent acquisition of a startup founded by former Apple design chief is also a concern for Cramer. OpenAI’s bid to make AI-enabled hardware is a question mark over Apple, according to Kramer. He adds that while he is not worried about long-term prospects, he says he won’t buy anymore stock in the current juncture.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:a7c04b149094b:0-cramer-is-worried-about-apple-here-s-why/

Magnificent 7 Trades at Seven-Year Low Valuation,1747667527000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL and its Magnificent 7 peers hit their cheapest collective valuation in seven years, Goldman Sachs finds. The group trades at a forward P/E of 28 versus 20 for the S&P 493, a 43% premium that sits in the 30th percentile of the past decade. That marks the lowest NTM multiple for Apple, Alphabet NASDAQ:GOOG , Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN , Meta NASDAQ:META , Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT , Nvidia NASDAQ:NVDA and Tesla NASDAQ:TSLA since 2018, strategist David Kostin wrote. Although concerns around AI spending, trade-policy uncertainty and antitrust lawsuits have driven multiples lower, Goldman's cross-sectional model suggests the cohort is actually trading at a modest discount to its fundamental profile based on earnings growth and balance-sheet strength.In the near term, Kostin says, lighter positioning, relatively cheaper valuations than the past two years and renewed AI enthusiasm after Q1 earnings could propel the Magnificent 7 higher. Yet the risk equation remains two-sided: ongoing U.S. and European antitrust probes into Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta could cast a shadow, and competitive headlineslike Apple's AI-powered search ambitions wiping 7% off Alphabet's share pricehighlight the vulnerability within the peer group.Despite those headwinds, the group's financial health and growth outlook remain robust, with average analyst earnings upgrades for the cohort outpacing the broader market. Investor focus is likely to oscillate between AI-driven upside potential and regulatory overhang, setting up a volatile but opportunity-rich environment for tech-heavy portfolios.Why It Matters: At multi-year lows, the Magnificent 7's valuation reset may offer a buying opportunity for investors seeking exposure to secular growth leaders, but regulatory and competitive risks warrant caution.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:81aac1760094b:0-magnificent-7-trades-at-seven-year-low-valuation/

"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Arista Networks, Apple and Applied Industrial Technologies",1747661160000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 19, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Apple AAPL and Applied Industrial Technologies AIT.Stock Buyback Bonanza: 3 Companies Scooping Up SharesThere are many ways that companies can keep shareholders happy, whether that be through robust financial performance or consistent dividend payouts, just for a few simple examples.Companies can also demonstrate a shareholder-friendly nature through share repurchase programs, also commonly known as stock buybacks.Several companies, including Arista Networks , Apple and Applied Industrial Technologies , recently unveiled fresh buybacks. Let's take a closer look at the benefits and the announcements of each.Benefits of Stock BuybacksStock buybacks, also known as share repurchase programs, are commonly deployed by companies to boost shareholder value.A stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves. Reducing the number of outstanding shares can boost earnings per share (EPS), also helping to put a floor under shares, reflective of consistent buying pressure.Still, it's worth mentioning that buybacks can sometimes bring out critics, as some believe the cash could be better deployed elsewhere, such as R&D. Nonetheless, buybacks are generally a net positive for shareholders, particularly those of mature companies with a much smaller growth runway.ANET Benefits from AIArista Networks' latest set of quarterly results beat our consensus EPS and sales estimates handily, with revenue of $2.0 billion showing nearly 30% growth year-over-year. The company's sales growth has been fueled by the AI frenzy, as the company is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus, and routing environments.The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with EPS expectations increasing across the board. Arista Networks unveiled an additional $1.5 billion repurchase program in the release.Apple Unveils Massive Stock BuybackDown 15% year-to-date, Apple shares have struggled in 2025, underperforming relative to the S&P 500 in a big way and driven lower by initial tariff headlines. Shares faced pressure as a result, but the recent de-escalation announcement between the US and China has brought back positivity.Apple unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting some of its cash to work. The earnings outlook for the tech titan remains under pressure, with analysts taking their EPS expectations lower across the board over recent months.The evolving EPS outlook of Apple is certainly going to be interesting, particularly so amid all the back-and-forth news we've received concerning tariffs and other economic developments. It's worth remembering that the company is no longer the growth machine it used to be, with EPS forecasted to climb 6% on 3% higher sales in its current fiscal year.AIT Generates Serious CashApplied Industrial Technologies exceeded both our consensus EPS and sales estimates, with EPS growing 4% YoY on the back of a 2% sales increase. The company's cash-generating abilities saw a notable boost throughout its latest period, with free cash flow of $115 million up 50% YoY.The cash-generating abilities have allowed the company to sport a shareholder-friendly nature, currently boasting a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. AIT unveiled a new repurchase program to buy up to 1.5 million shares, replacing the prior repurchase plan.Bottom LineCompanies commonly deploy repurchase programs to boost shareholder value, all of which we've recently seen from these companies listed above.All three have been aggressively buying shares over recent years, helping put in a floor while also aiding EPS. Though buybacks are criticized by some, they make great sense for mature companies with little growth left to squeeze.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:a97bab227094b:0-zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-arista-networks-apple-and-applied-industrial-technologies/

Ng, who maintains a Buy rating with a $253 price target, notes that Apple will need to showcase compelling Apple Intelligence features (think AI-enhanced Siri, on-screen awareness and personal context slated for late 2025/26) before Wall Street fully underwrites AI as a growth lever.Ng expects Apple to refresh iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS with standardized interfaces and convenience features, including public Wi-Fi syncing and AI-driven battery optimization in iOS 19. He also anticipates Apple opening its large language models to third-party developers and enhancing Siri's capabilities.

Apple's Stock Still Not Pricing in Trump's Demands - Heard on the Street — WSJ,1748023200000,"By Dan GallagherWhat do you do when the most powerful person in the world demands the impossible? If you're an Apple shareholder, you better settle in for a long, uncomfortable haul.Apple's share price took another tumble on Friday, after President Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on any iPhone made overseas. This is part of his push to have all iPhones sold in the U.S. made there as well. The stock has been on a mostly downward slope since Apple's disappointing earnings report on May 1 and has put the company's market value below that of Microsoft and Nvidia.That's far from a worst-case scenario. Apple's share price Friday morning represented a multiple of about 26 times projected earnings for the next four quarters. That's nearly in line with the company's five year average, according to FactSet data.That means more downside is possible-even for a stock now off 22% so far this year. If Trump's demands stick, Apple will likely simply pay the 25% tariff on its iPhones made in India and pass at least some of those costs on to its customers. That would be a far more palatable option than trying to move its massive, Asia-based supply chain to the U.S., which would take many years and hundreds of billions of dollars in a best-case scenario.But paying the additional tariffs has its downside as well. In a report earlier this month, Edison Lee of Jefferies said every percentage point increase in tariffs above ""current assumptions"" translates into a 1.5% impact on Apple's pre-tax profits this year.This analysis comes from the Journal's Heard on the Street team.

Trump Threatens European Union With 50% Tariffs; ING Says Trade War Fears Return,1748022717000,"US President Donald Trump on Friday proposed a 50% tariff rate on the European Union, a move that ING Bank said has ""reignited"" concerns about a transatlantic trade war. In a social media post, Trump recommended that a ""straight"" 50% tariff rate be applied on the EU starting June 1, saying that his administration's talks with the bloc had stalled. When Trump disclosed his reciprocal tariffs early in April, he set a 20% charge on imports from the EU. Trump on Friday criticized the bloc for what he said were ""powerful"" trade barriers. US benchmark equity indexes were down intraday. ""A relatively calm week comes to an abrupt and disappointing close, serving as a stark reminder that we remain far from any 'beautiful trade deals' or return to normality,"" ING said in a report published Friday. ""Volatility is back.""In a separate social media post Friday, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple slid 2.7%. Trump declared a 90-day pause on certain tariffs for non-retaliating countries in April. Recently, the US and China agreed to suspend most levies on each other's goods for 90 days, while Washington reached a trade deal with the UK. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed countermeasures on up to 95 billion euros ($107.82 billion) worth of US imports if negotiations with the Trump administration collapse, Reuters reported May 8. The bloc has offered a 50-billion-euro trade deal that includes liquefied natural gas purchases and no tariffs on cars and industrial goods, ING said. The White House appears to be ""dissatisfied"" with the EU's efforts to secure a deal, according to the brokerage. The EU didn't respond to MT Newswires' request for comment on Trump's latest tariff threat. ""While the EU is slower to act, it has prepared a couple of retaliatory tariff measures which are currently scheduled to enter into force (July 14),"" ING wrote. ""If talks truly collapse, expect the EU to reach for its heaviest artillery, such as tighter regulations on US tech firms, delaying licenses or restricting public procurement access and limiting (intellectual property) rights and investment flows under the Anti-Coercion Instrument.""",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384854:0/

Wall Street trades lower amid tariff threats; Donald Trump targets Apple and EU,1748022034000,"U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday after a fresh salvo of tariff talk from President Donald Trump unsettled investors and reignited concerns about global trade tensions. The losses capped a tough week for Wall Street, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all sliding more than 2 percent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 236 points, or 0.6 percent, while the S&P 500 declined 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq Composite underperformed, slipping 0.9 percent as big tech stocks bore the brunt of the pressure.Apple led the tech rout, falling over 2 percent after Trump took aim at the company in a post on Truth Social. He warned that iPhones sold in the United States should be manufactured domestically — or else face a 25 percent tariff. This marks the first time Trump has zeroed in on a specific company as part of his renewed push for tariffs this year.Semiconductor stocks also struggled. Shares of Micron and Qualcomm both fell 2 percent, while Nvidia gave up 1 percent.Adding to the market’s jitters, Trump said trade talks with the European Union were “going nowhere,” and floated the idea of slapping a 50 percent tariff on EU goods beginning June 1, 2025.In April, Trump’s broad-based tariffs had rattled investors and pushed the S&P 500 close to bear market territory.

SAP Is a European Mag-7 Stock. Analysts Say It Can Go Higher. — Barrons.com,1747548000000,"By Brian SwintSAP, the German maker of business software, has become Europe's largest company after stock gains of about 20% so far this year.As it hosts a conference for analysts on Monday in Orlando, Florida, the big question will be how long this spectacular run can last.The shares have defied gravity amid the turmoil surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs — outperforming every Magnificent Seven company since the start of the year. Much as the Mag 7 drove U.S. stocks up in 2024 and 2023, SAP is responsible for as much as half of the gains in Germany's blue chip DAX index, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.SAP — which helps companies organize everything from billing to human resources to travel expenses — still has a couple of things going for it. For one, the tariff turmoil seems to have only helped it in the first quarter. Unlike Apple or Tesla, it only makes software, so it shouldn't be directly affected by tariffs on goods. CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that ""two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.""At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

"AI Agents Face One Last, Big Obstacle — WSJ",1747483200000,"By Steven RosenbushSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — The race to build useful artificial-intelligence agents that can perform complex actions for people is moving on to a new set of challenges.The large language models at the core of these agents are good enough for many tasks. But there is a growing emphasis on connecting the LLMs inside agents to a plethora of tools that they will need to get their jobs done.An advanced LLM might fail at complex multiplication, for example, while the cheapest, oldest model can ace the test if it has a calculator tool.But there is another hurdle: Agents will need permission to access apps, APIs and websites if they are ever going to call an Uber or book a flight, the kind of expectation that has been established over the past year.Humans type passwords or use facial and fingerprint recognition to sign into their accounts, but AI agents require new methods of authorization to address the intermediary role between humans and the services they want to use, according to Alex Salazar, chief executive of startup Arcade.dev.The promise of agentsIn a recorded presentation shown at Apple's developer conference last June, one of the company's machine-learning and AI leaders shared a hypothetical example in which she asked Siri to tell her when her mom's flight was going to land. Siri would cross-reference flight details that her mom emailed with real-time flight tracking to determine an up-to-date arrival time.Next, she imagined that she wanted Siri to tell her the details of lunch plans with her mom, which Siri would ascertain by checking her calendar or text messages. And it would figure out how long it would actually take to get to lunch from the airport.Apple has yet to deliver, but the AI ecosystem is working on the ""plumbing"" that will make such complex AI agents possible.The effort got a boost last November when Anthropic, the startup behind the chatbot Claude, introduced an open-source standard known as Model Context Protocol. ""Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools,"" the user guide says.""Tool-calling agents are the emerging phase of agent AI development,"" Salazar told me. His 12-person startup on the outskirts of San Francisco is developing tools to tackle getting agents signed into websites, APIs and apps.The company, which Salazar co-founded last year with Chief Technology Officer Sam Partee, announced in March that it had raised $12 million of seed funding in a round led by Laude Ventures with participation by Flybridge Ventures, Hanabi Capital and the venture capitalist Andy Rachleff.Adoption curveGetting agents all the necessary tools and access is a significant obstacle.Device manufacturers will likely start integrating AI agents with core applications such as email and calendars, according to Salazar. As agents expand to other services, he said they would work best with companies that have public application programming interfaces, the bits of code that help one application connect to another. Some platforms deliberately limit API access to prevent abuse, and some older systems lack APIs.But that integration of AI agents and apps via existing authorization protocols could also be the last major challenge.Salazar says simple, low-risk AI agents work right now, and they will take on increasingly complex, high-risk tasks over the next two years. For example, Arcade is helping a customer, Shortwave, connect its AI email agent to other apps such as knowledge-management tool Notion, according to Shortwave co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Lee.AI agents over the next 24 months will increasingly draft communications and plan itineraries for people but still require human confirmation before final execution, Salazar predicts. After that point, he expects that fully autonomous agents will be allowed to operate, beginning with easy, low-risk tasks.Once the key engineering problems around agents are overcome, Salazar says, the world is poised for a new technological shake-up in the way things get done. The introduction of app stores in 2008 abruptly and broadly changed the norms by which people interact with the world. AI agents could be very close to triggering something just as big.Write to Steven Rosenbush at steven.rosenbush@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250517000659:0/

"US Equity Indexes Fall as Trump's Tariff Warning to European Union, Apple Saps Investor Sentiment",1748020648000,"US equity indexes declined with the dollar while gold futures jumped after President Donald Trump's warning to impose steep tariffs on the European Union, the United States' largest trading partner, and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL undermined risk sentiment. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9% to 18,762.4, with the S&P 500 down 0.6% to 5,805.8 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5% lower at 41,634.2. All sectors except utilities and consumer staples fell intraday, led by technology and consumer discretionary. In a social media post, Trump said trade talks with the European Union are going nowhere, and he is ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the bloc starting June 1. The EU is the US's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of total trade, a Stifel note said. In 2024, US goods exports to the EU totaled $370 billion, up 0.7% from the year prior, while imports from the EU were $606 billion, a 5.1% increase from 2023. As a result, the trade deficit with the EU totaled $236 billion in 2024, a $27 billion uptick from 2023. The ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's performance against the world's major currencies, slumped 0.7% to 99.17. Trump also threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the iconic technology giant, formerly the biggest in the world by market capitalization, sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares dropped 2.7% intraday, the biggest laggard on the Dow. ""We remain on a knife's edge as not a day goes by without the US administration practicing self-harm against US interests and taking the world down with it,"" Derek Holt, head of capital market economics at Scotiabank, said in a note. ""From tariffs to irresponsible fiscal profligacy, to destroying the value of the US signature on international agreements it has signed, and to debasing the dollar's credibility, great damage has clearly been done.""Gold futures surged 2% to $3,388.30 per ounce. ""Gold is heading for its best week in a month on raised US fiscal debt concerns following a jump in US long-end yields in response to Trump's tax bill, which will swell an already elevated US debt pile,"" Saxo Bank said in a note. Treasury yields were mixed intraday, with the mid-to-long dated maturities declining. The 10-year yield dropped 4.4 basis points to 4.51%. The 30-year yield retreated 3.1 basis points to 5.03%, but it remained above the psychologically important 5% level. Both the maturities headed higher this week after the House of Representatives voted 215-214 in favor of a budget reconciliation bill that will likely balloon the country's deficit by $2.3 trillion. In company news, Ross Stores NASDAQ:ROST overnight warned that elevated tariffs could pressure profitability, noting that over half its merchandise originates from China despite limited direct imports.

Its shares slumped 11% intraday, among the worst on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Deckers Outdoor's NYSE:DECK strong fiscal fourth-quarter results were overshadowed by sales growth deceleration at its Hoka sneaker brand and potential demand weakness from price increases, prompting KeyBanc Capital Markets to downgrade the footwear and apparel company's stock.

"Bitcoin, Bills, Brutal Bond Moves. Why That's a Warning for the Stock Market and 4 Other Things to Know Today. — Barrons.com",1747912020000,"The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday — because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a ""significant investment"" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H.

Review & Preview: A Car Play in A Trade War — Barron's,1747445400000,"By Ian SalisburyShares of online car retailer Carvana rallied some 5% on Tuesday after CEO Ernie Garcia argued that tariffs could boost used-car sales. Analysts agree: They expect Carvana's operating profits to more than double in 2025 and jump another 25% in 2026.But Carvana's high share price, at 58 times expected 2025 earnings, already reflects that optimism and requires a lot to go right in uncertain times. Investors might do better with another stock with a much cheaper valuation: Group 1 Automotive, which rallied 1.2% to more than $448 on Tuesday after Citigroup's Michael Ward raised his target price to $495 from $463.Group 1 owns more than 330 auto franchises. Wall Street sees relatively modest profit growth: 3.8% in 2025, 6.6% in 2026. But shares trade at less than 11 times 2025 earnings. About 50% of Group 1's revenue comes from new-vehicle sales, compared with 33% for used vehicles, notes CFRA. If tariffs steer shoppers toward used cars instead of new ones, that could cut into Group 1's biggest market.Still, Ward notes, 25% of Group 1's revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where U.S. tariff plans mean little. He says its multiple could expand as memories of the Covid-era industry's dislocations fade. ""Dealer stocks are valued at a 15% discount to pre-Covid levels despite better-than-expected financial performance during and after the crises,"" he wrote, giving an opportunity for Group 1's double-digit revenue growth in 2025-26.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsThe U.S. and China cut tariffs for 90 days: U.S. on China goods to 30%, China on U.S. goods to 10%.

"Stock Market News for May 22, 2025",1747909440000,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday following spike in yields of long-dated U.S. sovereign bonds. Market participants remained concerned that the proposed tax-cut bill of President Trump will further worsen U.S. fiscal deficit. The U.S.-China tariff war also remained unresolved. All three major stock indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plummeted 1.9% or 816.80 points to close at 41,860.44. Notably, 29 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory and one finished in positive zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 18,872.64, sliding 1.4% due to weak performance of technology bigwigs. Technology giants like Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns. The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa. Moody’s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government’s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities. As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February. Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:747eff640094b:0-stock-market-news-for-may-22-2025/

All sectors except utilities fell intraday, led by technology and consumer discretionary. Trump said in a social media post that trade talks with the European Union are going nowhere and he is ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the bloc starting on June 1. The EU is the US's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of total trade, according to a note from Stifel. In 2024, US goods exports to the EU totaled $370 billion, up 0.7% from the year prior, while imports from the EU were $606 billion, a 5.1% increase from 2023. As a result, the trade deficit with the EU totaled $236 billion in 2024, a $27 billion uptick from 2023.

Apple (AAPL) Faces Trump Pushback Over India Manufacturing Shift,1747428341000,"Apple (AAPL, Financials) came under scrutiny Thursday as President Donald Trump said he urged CEO Tim Cook to halt product manufacturing in India and prioritize U.S.-based production instead.Trump, citing a little problem with Cook, said he reminded the Apple chief of the company's $500 billion U.S. investment pledge and expressed dissatisfaction over Apple's ongoing expansion in India. Apple currently assembles around 90% of its iPhones in China but is planning to shift about 25% of that production to India in the coming years.Trump also stated that Apple may increase its U.S. manufacturing efforts, although he offered no details. The president's remarks align with recent White House trade measures, including a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian imports, temporarily lowered until July. India, in response, has offered to drop tariffs entirely on U.S. goods, Trump said.Meanwhile, Apple's main Indian assembly partner, Foxconn, received clearance to build a semiconductor plant in partnership with HCL Group. The move highlights Apple's broader diversification strategy, which includes exploring production in Vietnam as well.Experts say bringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could result in steep price increases. Estimates place the cost of a domestically built iPhone between $1,500 and $3,500. Currently, Apple's only major U.S.-made hardware is the Mac Pro. The company also recently announced a Texas facility for AI server production.The pressure from Trump introduces political and economic tension into Apple's global supply chain strategy, with potential implications for both production costs and market positioning.Investors will be watching how Apple balances political pressure with supply chain resilience and whether it makes further concessions toward onshore manufacturing.- See insider trades for AAPL. - Explore Peter Lynch chart.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:a5ba37090094b:0-apple-aapl-faces-trump-pushback-over-india-manufacturing-shift/
OpenAI acquires Jony Ive’s AI startup io in landmark $6.5B deal: should Apple be concerned?,1747892436000,"OpenAI will acquire io, the secretive artificial intelligence hardware startup co-founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, in a landmark all-stock transaction valued at nearly $6.5 billion. The move is OpenAI’s most significant acquisition to date and signals a determined push into developing physical consumer devices powered by AI.The purchase gives OpenAI access not only to io’s team of around 55 engineers and designers but also to the creative vision of Ive, the British-born designer behind Apple’s most iconic products including the iPhone, iPod, and MacBook Air. The acquisition also formalises a relationship that has been in the making for nearly two years, as Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have quietly explored new device ideas together.“I have a growing sense that everything I’ve learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place and to this moment,” Ive said in a joint interview with Altman.

The team, now under OpenAI’s umbrella, will focus on building what Altman and Ive describe as “a family of devices” for the age of artificial general intelligence.The duo did not share specifics about the hardware under development but indicated that the first product would not simply be an iteration of the smartphone or laptop, but an entirely new computing form factor designed to complement AI’s growing capabilities. “People have an appetite for something new,” Ive said, hinting at user fatigue with current devices.Altman added, “AI is such a big leap forward in terms of what people can do that it needs a new kind of computing form factor to get the maximum potential out of it.”The first device from the collaboration is slated for release in 2026.Who is Jony Ive?Once described by Steve Jobs as his “spiritual partner”, Jony Ive’s return to the heart of consumer technology marks a significant comeback for one of the most influential designers of the modern era. The British-born designer spent decades at Apple, where he worked closely with Steve Jobs to shape products that would define a generation, including the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple Watch. Ive left Apple in 2019 after a storied tenure, having played a central role in establishing the visual and tactile language of today’s smartphones and personal devices.Sam Altman@sama·Followhttps://twitter.com/sama/status/1925242282523103408thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.Watch on TwitterView replies10:58 pm · 21 May 2025https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy0ReplyCopy linkRead more on TwitterAt the time of his departure, Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that Ive and the company would continue to collaborate, but no joint products ever materialized. After leaving Apple, Ive founded the design firm LoveFrom, a creative collective composed of former Apple colleagues and longtime collaborators. In 2023, he co-founded the startup io with Apple veterans Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan — each with deep experience in the company’s hardware ecosystem. Acquisition brings ex-Apple hardware veterans to OpenAIThe acquisition also brings into OpenAI’s fold a collection of ex-Apple hardware veterans who followed Ive after his departure from the tech giant in 2019.Among them are Scott Cannon, co-creator of the Mailbox app; Evans Hankey, Ive’s successor at Apple; and Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch product design until 2024.At io, the team had been developing devices suited for a future defined by artificial general intelligence—where machines achieve human-like cognitive abilities. That mission now becomes part of OpenAI’s strategy as it seeks to embed intelligence not just in software but across the physical world.The hardware ambitions are supported by other investors including Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective, Thrive Capital, Maverick Capital, and SV Angel. OpenAI confirmed that Altman holds no personal equity in io.Apple shares fall amid concerns over AI leadershipNews of the acquisition sent Apple shares down as much as 2.3% on Wednesday, as the market absorbed the implications of its former star designer now leading the charge at one of its AI rivals. Apple has been seen as lagging behind in artificial intelligence, with its recently introduced AI platform partly dependent on OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Analysts say the move could accelerate Apple’s perceived decline in AI leadership and product innovation. “Jobs would be damn proud,” Altman said of the new venture, praising Ive’s creative legacy and calling their collaboration a “rare opportunity.”Though the move poses potential competition for Apple, Altman and Ive were careful to note that their project does not aim to replace the smartphone. “In the same way that the smartphone didn’t make the laptop go away, I don’t think our first thing is going to make the smartphone go away,” Altman said.Building AI’s physical futureOpenAI’s push into consumer hardware arrives as competition in AI intensifies. The company, currently valued at $300 billion, is racing to keep pace with rivals including Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI. All are investing aggressively and rapidly launching new AI models and features.To support its expansion, OpenAI has bolstered its hardware and robotics expertise. In November, it hired Caitlin “CK” Kalinowski, the former head of Meta’s Orion augmented reality glasses project, to lead its consumer hardware and robotics efforts. Kalinowski said the goal was to “unlock AI’s benefits for humanity” through physical products.In a separate effort, OpenAI also invested in San Francisco-based robotics startup Physical Intelligence, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion valuation. That company is working to integrate general-purpose AI into the physical world through robots powered by large-scale algorithms.

Apple Can't Really Make iPhones in the U.S. What It May Do to Offset Tariffs. — Barrons.com,1748017260000,"Tae KimApple is facing difficult choices if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to put a big tariff on iPhones.On Friday, Trump said he would impose tariff of at least 25% on Apple iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the smartphones are made domestically. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the last earnings call that more iPhones sold in the U.S. will be made in India as Apple continues to geographically diversify its manufacturing footprint.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, "" Trump wrote in a post on social-media platform Truth Social.""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,"" the president added.In early trading Friday, Apple shares fell by 2.6% to $196.17.Trump has been resolute about the topic. Last month, when asked by a reporter if Trump wants iPhones to be made domestically, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: ""Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.""Wall Street analysts, however, generally believe domestic iPhone manufacturing isn't tenable on a financial basis. The company relies on the contract manufacturer Foxconn to make the vast majority of its iPhones in China. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimates an iPhone made in the U.S. would be sold at $3,500 versus $1,000 today.""We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhone in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,"" Ives wrote on Friday, adding such a move to shift production would take five to 10 years.In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. Jobs bluntly replied: ""Those jobs aren't coming back,"" citing how only Asia has the supply chain ecosystem, from screws to rubber gaskets, along with thousands of specialized manufacturing engineers needed to make smartphones.If Trump doesn't back down, Apple faces several options to revamp its product strategy to mitigate the impact from tariffs.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has suggested Apple can remove the less-profitable, low-end storage models from its iPhone lineup. A ""targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,"" Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has said Apple can move new launches to a two-year schedule from annually. That would to help simplify the supply chain by extending the timeline on expensive manufacturing changes.Of course, Apple can decide to fight Trump and pressure him to revoke an iPhone tariff. The company could threaten to add a ""tariff surcharge"" to every sales receipt, so consumers know Trump's policies are responsible for the higher prices.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Market Chatter: Apple Ramps Up Efforts Against Texas Age Verification Bill,1748015848000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL Chief Executive Tim Cook called Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week, asking him to change or veto a new bill that would require app stores to verify the age of users and link minors' accounts to their parents, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing unnamed people familiar with the call. Despite Apple's efforts, the bill passed the Texas legislature with veto-proof support. ""The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk,"" a spokesperson for Abbott was quoted as saying. To push back, Apple has hired more lobbyists and funded ads against the bill, the report added. The law, dubbed App Store accountability law, would make Apple and similar tech companies responsible for confirming a device owner's age and notifying parents when a child wants to download an app. ""If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,"" an Apple spokesman was quoted as saying.

"David Tepper's Appaloosa Sells FedEx Stock, Alters Mag 7 Holdings — Barrons.com",1747426800000,"Al RootHedge funds are filing their required quarterly portfolio disclosures, a focus for investors who want to know what the "" smart money"" is doing.Appaloosa Management qualifies as smart money. It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased. Appaloosa doesn't have a position in Tesla stock, the other company in the group.That the fund changed the weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks in its portfolio, excluding Tesla, shouldn't surprise anyone. The decision to sell out of FedEx and Intel might raise eyebrows.FedEx stock fell 0.7% on Friday, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%. Intel stock gained 0.5%.In the first quarter, FedEx shares dropped about 13%, and Intel stock gained about 13%. Appaloosa might have taken profits in the latter and not see a turnaround coming for the former.

Wedbush Dubs U.S. iPhone Plan a Fairy Tale,1748014030000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL shares slump as Wedbush warns Trump tariff threat deepens investor frustration.Stocks of the iPhone maker fell nearly 3% in premarket trading after President Trump said Apple would face a 25% tariff on devices not built in the U.S. Wedbush Securities dubbed the pronouncement a frustrating situation for investors, noting the cost and logistics hurdles make domestic assembly all but impossible. Apple's stock had already dipped 0.36% at market close yesterday.While Apple recently pledged $500 billion in U.S. investmentslargely focused on AI initiativesWedbush analysts see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the near-term given the upside-down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics. They warn a U.S.-built iPhone would carry a roughly $3,500 price tag and take five to ten years to scale, calling the idea a fairy tale.Why It Matters: Tariff uncertainty could squeeze margins and delay rollout plans, forcing investors to reconsider risk ahead of new device cycles.With Apple currently trading around $197, there's a notable gap between its market price and the average 12-month target of $230.90a potential upside of over 17%. The GF Value at $208.90 also suggests shares may be undervalued at current levels. The bullish target of $300 implies strong upside potential, though the low estimate of $141 signals caution.

"Top Midday Stories: Trump Threatens Apple, EU With Tariffs; Booz Allen Plans to Cut 7% of Workforce in Q1",1748013722000,"All three major US stock indexes were down in late-morning trading Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to levy tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL and the European Union earlier in the day via two Truth Social posts. Trump said he is recommending a ""straight"" 50% tariff on the EU, effective June 1 because the union has been ""very difficult to deal with."" Separately, Trump threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if the tech giant doesn't begin producing iPhones within the US. Apple shares were down 2.6% around midday. Booz Allen Hamilton NYSE:BAH Chief Financial Officer said Friday on the company's earnings call that the company plans to reduce its workforce of 36,000 employees by about 7% in Q1. The cuts will be heavily concentrated in the company's civil business, he said. Booz Allen shares were down 13.6%. Douglas Elliman NYSE:DOUG has received a merger offer from Anywhere Real Estate (HOUS) this week that would value the company at roughly double its current share price, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The bid comes as the real estate brokerage is dealing with the fallout from lawsuits involving a pair of former star agents, according to the report. Douglas Elliman shares were up 32%, while those of Anywhere Real Estate were up 4.5%. Workday NASDAQ:WDAY reported fiscal Q1 non-GAAP earnings late Thursday of $2.23 per diluted share, up from $1.74 a year earlier and above the FactSet consensus analyst estimate of $2.01.

What Sam Altman Told OpenAI About the Secret Device He's Making With Jony Ive — WSJ,1747882740000,"Berber JinOpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave his staff a preview Wednesday of the devices he is developing to build with former Apple designer Jony Ive, laying out plans to ship 100 million AI ""companions"" that he hopes will become a part of everyday life.Altman told employees that they had ""the chance to do the biggest thing we've ever done as a company here,"" he said after announcing OpenAI's plans to purchase Ive's startup, named io, and give him an expansive creative and design role. He suggested the $6.5 billion acquisition has the potential to add $1 trillion in value to OpenAI, according to a recording reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.In the meeting, Ive noted how closely he worked with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs before his passing in 2011. With Altman, ""the way that we clicked, and the way that we've been able to work together, has been profound for me.""Altman and Ive offered a few hints at the secret project they have been working on. The product will be capable of being fully aware of a user's surroundings and life, will be unobtrusive, able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the device won't be a phone, and that Ive and Altman's intent is to help wean users off of screens. Altman said the device also isn't a pair of glasses, and that Ive had been skeptical about building something to wear on the body.Ive referenced ""a new design movement."" Altman said it would amount to a ""family of devices,"" bringing up his fondness for how Apple has long integrated its hardware and software offerings.Altman told OpenAI staff that stealth will be important for their ultimate success to avoid competitors copying the product before it's ready.For months, Ive's team has been speaking with vendors who will be able to ship the device at scale. ""We're not going to ship 100 million devices literally on day one,"" Altman said, predicting that OpenAI would ship that large quantity of high-quality devices ""faster than any company has ever shipped 100 million of something new before."" Altman said the goal is to release a device by late next year.The grandiose plans echo Altman's bold vision for OpenAI's expansion in many spheres, including for data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars, enterprise technology, chatbots, personal robots and beyond.Rolling out new devices, especially ones that will compete with deep-pocketed, multitrillion-dollar companies like Apple or Google, has long been among the most difficult of challenges in the tech industry. Humane, another startup made up of former Apple executives that Altman invested in, sold an ""Ai Pin"" that failed to catch on with consumers.And OpenAI is already bleeding cash. The startup told investors last fall it won't generate a profit until 2029, and it expects to lose $44 billion before doing so, the Journal has reported.While Apple and Google have struggled to keep pace with AI innovations, many investors see the two companies — whose software runs nearly all the world's smartphones — as the primary means through which billions of people will access AI tools and chatbots. Building a device is the only way OpenAI and other artificial-intelligence companies will be able to interact with consumers directly.Altman and Ive also offered details about how their collaboration grew in the last several years. Eighteen months ago, OpenAI's Vice President of Product Peter Welinder began working with Ive's team. The two sides became excited about a specific device last fall.The original plan was for Ive's startup to build and sell its own device using OpenAI's technology, but Altman said he eventually realized that wouldn't work. Altman said he knew the two companies would have to be combined because the device wasn't just an accessory but a central facet of the user relationship with OpenAI.""We both got excited about the idea that, if you subscribed to ChatGPT, we should just mail you new computers, and you should use those,"" Altman said.Altman said he and Ive came to believe that existing devices wouldn't work. While ChatGPT changed people's expectations about the power of technology, it is still being used in an old paradigm: holding a laptop, launching a website, and typing something in and waiting.""It is not the sci-fi dream of what AI could do to enable you in all the ways that I think the models are capable of,"" Altman said.Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521011770:0/

Markets Slide on Bond Option; Q1 Earnings After the Close,1747864740000,"Wednesday, May 21, 2025A couple things happened mid-day that sent a steady flat-to-down session falling into the red and staying there. Market indexes closed off their lows, but appeared to be trending back down in the final minutes before the close. The Dow slip -816 points, -1.91%, the S&P 500 -95, -1.61%, the Nasdaq -270, -1.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 -55 points, -2.63%.One occurrence was a sell-off in bonds, likely having something to do with the U.S. government planning to add to the overall deficit with a major tax cut bill working its way through Congress. The three credit rating agencies have already downgraded the U.S. from AAA, and now this bond option has led to spiking Treasury yields: +4.59% on the 10-year, +4.01% on the 2-year, and back up over +5% on the 30-year bond.The other event was more localized in the realm of AI and concerning the original designer of the iPhone, Jony Ive. Ive’s AI startup io is going to Sam Altman’s OpenAI for a cool $6.4 billion, and without many details the market priced in a discount at Apple AAPL, which closed -2.3% on the day. What this move signals in a broader sense, however, is that access to AI design and implementation is becoming increasingly competitive.Q1 Earnings After the Close: URBN, SNOW, ZMUrban Outfitters URBN posted solid beats on its Q1 report after today’s closing bell, with earnings of $1.16 per share easily outperforming the 81 cents expected. Revenues of $1.33 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks consensus of $1.29 billion. Comps rose +4.8% year over year, led by Anthropologie. Company subscribers rose by nearly +60%. The retailer made no mention of tariff impacts on future gains. Shares are up +9% after hours. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Data storage firm Snowflake SNOW also outpaced estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with earnings of 24 cents per share beating expectations by 2 cents on quarterly sales of $1.04 billion, which improved over the $1.00 billion analysts were anticipating. Product revenue guidance was placed much higher for Q2: $997 million versus $962 million previously expected. Shares gained +7% on the news in late trading.Zoom Communications ZM makes it 3-for-3 following Wednesday’s close: earnings of $1.43 per share “zoomed” past the Zacks consensus $1.30, with revenues eking out a slight beat: $1.17 billion versus $1.16 billion. Earnings guidance was lifted while revenues were kept in-line, as gains in Enterprise outperformed estimates. The videoconferencing services firm had jumped higher on the news, but have moderated somewhat.What to Expect from the Stock Market ThursdayFinally, tomorrow morning we see some economic reportage, including Weekly Jobless Claims, S&P flash Services and Manufacturing PMI, and Existing Home Sales. Expectations are for jobless claims to remain steady at the slightly higher levels we’ve seen over the past few weeks, lower PMI results with Services remaining above the 50 threshold but Manufacturing dipping below it, and home sales coming in slightly higher month over month.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Dow logs worst day in a month. Here are the reasons driving the rout.,1747859820000,"By Isabel WangThe yield on the 30-year Treasury bond hovers at its highest level since Oct. 25, 2023The stock market's selloff picked up steam on Wednesday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its steepest daily decline in a month.The blue-chip index DJIA tumbled over 800 points, or 1.9%, to end at 41,860.44, while the S&P 500 SPX close 1.6% lower, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP slumped 1.4%, according to FactSet data.The Dow's biggest drag was shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc., (UNH) which fell 5.8% after HSBC cut its rating on the stock to reduce, a month after downgrading it to hold. The bank also slashed its stock-price target to $270 from $490, with the new target implying about 12% downside from current levels.Consumer stocks also came under pressure on Wednesday. Shares of Nike Inc. (NKE) fell more than 4.1%, while those of TJ Maxx parent (TJX) tumbled 2.9% after the discount retailer said tariff costs could cause it to fall short of Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings projections. Royal Caribbean Group's (RCL) stock fell 4.6%, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' (NCLH) stock was off over 5.2%, according to FactSet data.Shares of Target Corp.

U.S. Stock Futures Plunge on Trump Tariff Concerns,1748012160000,"Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet.After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation.

Stocks tally worst session in a month as weak bond-market auction has investors wondering how U.S. will manage its debt,1747858620000,"By Joseph Adinolfi and Joy WiltermuthWorries about rising bond yields are coming home to roost, sending the Dow down 800 pointsInvestors have been warily eyeing rising Treasury yields since the start of May, with some fretting that the latest jump in borrowing costs could soon start hurting stocks.Those fears were realized on Wednesday, as a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields climbing to fresh highs. Borrowing costs tied to long-dated debt touched levels not seen since late 2023.That sent stocks reeling, with major indexes tallying their worst session since April 21, Dow Jones Market Data showed.""Looks like we are sinking,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said after the weak 20-year bond auction.The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was knocking on the door of the 4.6% level, and concerns about tariffs and ""the battle of the budget"" remain, he said.Republicans are working to pass President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill. The latest version of the legislation included tax and spending cuts but would do little to pare the U.S. budget deficit.""When you have yields jumping up like this, it's a tough crosscurrent for stocks,"" Cardillo said.Stocks had shaken off some of their early losses heading into the afternoon, as gains for Big Tech names like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into the green.But around 1 p.m., the market suffered a one-two punch. Reports that OpenAI would buy an artificial-intelligence company founded by former Apple Inc. (AAPL) design chief Jony Ive appeared to weigh on shares of Ive's former employer.Around the same time, the weak 20-year BX:TMUBMUSD20Y auction helped revive concerns about waning foreign demand for U.S. debt. Suddenly, investors were starting to question how the U.S. would manage its debt burden over the long term.This, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy, was enough to weigh on stocks, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Management.See: Why the next 20-year Treasury auction is 'must-see TV' for investors after the Moody's downgrade""It's a question of how much growth are we going to get, and what is the revenue stream for the U.S. government looking like to support the debt that they're issuing,"" he said.Mulberry also pointed out that pain in debt markets was a global phenomenon on Wednesday, as yields on bonds trading in Japan and Europe also spiked.Earlier, investors digested weak earnings from Target Corp. (TGT), along with a report from fellow retailer TJX Cos. (TJX), the parent of TJ Maxx, which Mulberry described as not as bad as Target's, but still not great. Shares of both companies were selling off.Meanwhile, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) fell further, heaping more pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was also weakening, signaling that the ""Sell America"" trade might be back on, at least for now. Meanwhile, gold (GC00) and bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed, with the latter hitting a fresh record high north of $109,000 per coin.The S&P 500 SPX finished 95.85 points, or 1.6%, lower at 5,844.61, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 270.07 points, or 1.4%, at 18,872.64.

Pre-Markets Drop Hard on New Trump Tariff Talk,1748010600000,"Friday, May 23, 2025Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around. Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas — whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed — unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America’s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we’ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report — the Fed’s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)After today’s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation. See you next week.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

OpenAI Is Buying Jony Ive's AI Start-Up for $6.4 Billion. Apple Stock Falls. — Barrons.com,1747850940000,"By Angela Palumbo and Mackenzie TatananniOpenAI said Wednesday that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion.

The video signs off with a slide that says: ""We look forward to sharing our work next year.""Apple stock was down about 2% on the news. That company has its own family of devices, including the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops and the iPad. Investors have been looking for signs from the tech giant that its own AI software, Apple Intelligence, can incentivize people to purchase its products. But the rollout of this software has been slower than Wall Street would like.The merger between io and OpenAI, with the promise to make a ""family of devices,"" powered by AI, seems to have made Apple investors even more wary.Barron's has reached out to Apple for comment.In an attempt to broaden its AI reach, Apple teamed up with OpenAI in 2024 to integrate ChatGPT capabilities into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Trump Threatens At Least 25% Tariffs on Apple's iPhones Made Outside US,1748010562000,"President Donald Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple NASDAQ:AAPL if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. This follows Trump's remark from last week that he had asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing in India. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their (iPhones) that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote in a social media post on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""Apple shares fell 2.4% in Friday trading. Producing iPhones in the US is not ""feasible"" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a Friday note, calling the idea a ""fairy tale.""Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives estimate that manufacturing iPhones domestically could raise their price to about $3,500, adding that it would take five to 10 years to shift production to the US. During a quarterly earnings call at the beginning of this month, Cook said he expected the majority of iPhones sold in the US to have India as their source country for the ongoing three-month period, and China to be the country of origin for a ""vast majority"" of product sales outside the US. Cook's comments came as the US and China raised duties on each other's goods. However, Washington and Beijing recently agreed on a 90-day suspension of tariffs. ""We believe (Apple) will continue to navigate this complex tariff situation in a game of negotiations especially heading into iPhone 17 production this fall,"" Ives said Friday. Wedbush maintained its outperform rating on Apple's stock with a $270 price target. Apple in February announced plans to invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years, including for an artificial intelligence server factory in Texas.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/mtnewswires.com:20250523:A3384708:0/
Former Apple Design Guru Jony Ive to Take Expansive Role at OpenAI — WSJ,1747849620000,"By Keach Hagey and Berber JinJony Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and his design firm are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, where they will develop consumer devices and other projects that will shape the future look and feel of AI.OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, have been working on a new device that will move consumers beyond screens, according to people familiar with the matter. They have been collaborating for two years on a closely guarded project, considering options including headphones and other devices with cameras, the people said.The partnership between Ive, a visionary designer, and OpenAI, which has transformed how consumers seek information, could herald a new era of AI-powered consumer technology. It puts a seasoned designer at the creative helm of a fast-growing startup that aims to one day have a hand in everything from devices to AI-powered robots, AI models with humanlike intelligence and a global network of data centers.The former Apple employee's work at OpenAI will extend across all the company's ventures, from future versions of ChatGPT to audio features, its app and other products, according to people familiar with the matter.London-born Ive left Apple in 2019 to found LoveFrom, a design firm that has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb and the luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. Ive also leads io, a company founded last year to design and develop a new family of AI-powered products.As part of an unusual deal announced Wednesday, OpenAI will also acquire io in an all-equity deal that values it at $6.5 billion. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in the company late last year, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI's startup fund also invested at the time.The acquisition of the rest of Ive's io puts an executive who helped change the relationship between consumers and technology at the forefront of development of devices that move consumers away from screens.Io's staff of roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI, while LoveFrom continues to operate independently.OpenAI will be a customer of LoveFrom and LoveFrom will receive a stake in OpenAI, people familiar with the matter said. The companies expect the transaction to close this summer pending regulatory approval.""I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this moment,"" Ive said. Altman said he hopes the team can ""bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit that I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago.""Ive and Altman said in a joint statement that their work together grew out of friendship and collaboration.Altman has taken a number of steps to explore device and hardware options, investing in 2020 in the startup Humane, which launched what it called the Ai Pin with OpenAI's technology that failed to catch on with consumers.Altman has long been fond of Apple and was eager to strike a deal with the iPhone-maker when the company sought partnerships for the rollout of Apple Intelligence about a year ago. He has idolized Apple co-founder Steve Jobs even though Altman has been outspoken in his criticism of smartphones and what he sees as toxic aspects of screen addiction.OpenAI's acquisition of io points to its growing ambitions as a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, who's tasked with helping the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.While much of Ive's work at Apple revolved around the specific look and feel of products in the physical world, he also took greater responsibility for software issues on certain devices toward the end of his tenure there.Write to Keach Hagey at Keach.Hagey@wsj.com and Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521008183:0/
"Trump Threatens 50% Tariff on the EU, Stoking Fresh Trade Tensions — Barrons.com",1748010540000,"By George Glover and Reshma KapadiaPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would impose a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1 and threatened 25% tariffs on Apple iPhones if they weren't made in the U.S., reminding the market that the trade war is still very much on.Trump announced the levies in a post on Truth Social, citing the EU's ""powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies.""He said that he was ""recommending a straight 50% tariff"" on the trading bloc, to take effect June 1. The duties won't apply to any products that are manufactured in the U.S., Trump added.Europe's flagship Stoxx 600 index plummeted after Trump said he would impose the levies. It was down 1.8% at last check. Paris's CAC 40 tumbled 2.8% and Frankfurt's Dax dropped 2.3%. U.S. stocks also fell.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and the European Commissioner For Trade Maroš efčovič are set to speak on a call later on Friday. The European Commission's spokesperson on trade declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment about Trump's Truth Social post.The latest threats come as trade talks have dragged out on multiple fronts and analysts like Owen Tedford at Beacon Policy Advisors has worried that Trump could look to make an example of a token country to pressure other priority countries to commit to some sort of framework agreement faster.""The EU is particularly problematic for the Trump administration because they are not caving to pressure,"" says Henrietta Treyz, head of research at political consultancy Veda Partners. The two sides aren't closer to a resolution on longstanding issues, including standards for agriculture and commodity purchases and a digital services tax.The escalation is similar to the approach the administration tried with China and then walked back with its recent pause. ""He has created an untenable tariff that effectively bans trade between the two nations,"" says Treyz, who expects tariffs on EU to rise, probably to 20% to 30%. ""By threatening 50% today, should he land at 20% or even 30%, it's possible the market sees that as 'de-escalation' and doesn't respond as negatively to the shock.""""Dialing tariffs up or down is one way the administration believes it can bring forth change in global supply chains and trade,"" says Juhi Dhawan, a macro strategist for Wellington Management via email, who expects the tariffs to be a tool used throughout the Trump presidency.The takeaway for investors: The relative calm around trade may have been misplaced. In a client note this morning, Apollo Global Chief Economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that container traffic hasn't rebounded after the 90-day pause and roll back on U.S.-China tariffs, a sign that the uncertainty is still paralyzing trade.Write to George Glover at george.glover@dowjones.com and Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Dividend Watch: 2 Red-Hot Stocks Boosting Payouts,1747840500000,"Everybody loves dividends, as they provide a passive income stream, limit drawdowns in other positions, and provide more than one way to profit from an investment.And when considering dividend-paying stocks, those with a history of boosting their payout are prime considerations, reflecting their commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.In addition, consistent dividend hikes reflect the company’s successful nature, opting to share profits with shareholders.For those seeking companies that have recently boosted payouts, Apple AAPL and Vistra VST fit the criteria. Let’s take a closer look at each.Apple Keeps Generating CashApple’s latest set of quarterly results came with several positives, including record Services revenue and record EPS for its March quarter. Total sales grew 5% year-over-year throughout the above-mentioned period, with adjusted EPS of $1.65 up 8% from the same period last year.The company’s stellar cash-generating abilities have allowed it to reward shareholders nicely, with the tech titan announcing a 4% boost to its quarterly dividend payout. Apple also unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting even more of its cash to work.The tech titan generated $20.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.Due to its heavy manufacturing exposure in China, the recent de-escalation of trade tensions is a massive positive. Apple previously warned it may pass the higher costs onto consumers through iPhone price hikes, so the recent news is excellent for both parties.Shares jumped on the news, gaining nearly 20% since the announcement.Vistra Increases Payout AgainVistra safely operates a reliable, efficient, power generation fleet of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Shares have been scorching hot over the last year, gaining nearly 70% thanks to demand stemming from the AI infrastructure buildout.The company announced a 3% increase to its quarterly payout, continuing a trend of higher payouts over the years. VST presently sports a 13% five-year annualized dividend growth rate, with its payout ratio sitting sustainably at 12% of its earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s dividends paid on a quarterly basis.Importantly, Vistra reaffirmed its current year guidance in its latest release in early May, providing a big sigh of relief to investors. The Q1 earnings cycle has largely been dictated by commentary for the upcoming periods, and VST cleared the critical hurdle.Bottom LineDividends bring many great perks to investors, such as passive income and the ability to achieve maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.Companies typically boost payouts when business is running smoothly, overall sending a positive message concerning the longer-term picture as well. In addition, consistently higher payouts owe to a company’s cash-generating abilities, undoubtedly a huge positive.And for those seeking companies looking to pay their shareholders a higher paycheck, both companies above – Apple AAPL and Vistra VST – fit the criteria.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:1ed91535c094b:0-dividend-watch-2-red-hot-stocks-boosting-payouts/

Fortnite Returns to Apple's App Store in the U.S. — Update,1747839240000,"By Mauro Orru""Fortnite"" is back on Apple's App Store in the U.S. nearly five years after the iPhone maker removed the popular videogame amid a long-running dispute with developer Epic Games.Apple yanked ""Fortnite"" from its app store in August 2020 after Epic Games sought to introduce its own in-app payment system that bypassed a 30% commission that Apple charged on in-app transactions.Apple said it removed ""Fortnite"" because Epic's payments feature violated its policies, while Epic Games countered that Apple collected an unfair cut of revenue. The two companies have been locked in a legal back-and-forth ever since.In a post on X, Epic Games said late Tuesday that Fortnite was back on the App Store in the U.S. for iPhones and iPads, as well as the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the European Union.The reinstatement of the game comes weeks after a federal judge said Apple had violated a 2021 ruling that required the iPhone maker to loosen its restrictions on how developers can seek payment within their apps.The judge, who issued a new order for the company to allow developers to steer users to alternate methods of paying for services or subscriptions offered in the App Store, also took the extraordinary step of referring the matter to federal prosecutors to determine whether criminal contempt proceedings are warranted.Apple said it would comply with that order, though it disagreed with the court's decision which it planned to appeal.Epic Games last week said Apple had blocked the ""Fortnite"" app it had submitted for review. Apple said it had asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to affect ""Fortnite"" in other geographies.On Monday, the same judge that presided over the 2021 case effectively demanded that Apple approve the reinstatement of ""Fortnite"" on the App Store or send a representative to court to prove it had a basis for not doing so, according to court records seen by The Wall Street Journal.Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on the reinstatement of ""Fortnite.""Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20250521006993:0-fortnite-returns-to-apple-s-app-store-in-the-u-s-update/
Trump Just Threatened Apple With a 25% Tariff -- Here's What Could Happen Next,1748008801000,"Donald Trump just fired a shot across Apple's NASDAQ:AAPL bow and markets flinched. In a fiery Truth Social post on Friday, the former U.S. President warned that if iPhones sold in America aren't made on American soil, Apple could be hit with a 25% tariff. Trump claimed he had already told Tim Cook to stop shifting production to India and ""anyplace else,"" suggesting a potential policy reversal if he's reelected.Investors didn't take it lightly. Apple stock sank 3.4% in the premarket trading at 7.49am, dragging Nasdaq (QQQ) futures into the red. The sell-off highlights just how sensitive markets remain to tariff talk especially when it comes to tech giants with deep global supply chains. Despite Apple's multi-billion-dollar U.S. investment pledges, the company still relies heavily on China and has recently ramped up iPhone manufacturing in India a strategic hedge that now faces political headwinds.Apple hasn't commented yet, but the message from Trump is loud and clear: bring jobs back or pay the price. A 25% tariff would hit Apple's margins or force it to pass costs to consumers neither of which would sit well with shareholders. For now, this is just talk. But with the 2024 race heating up and reshoring back in the spotlight, Apple investors may want to start scenario planning.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/gurufocus:17ef80ced094b:0-trump-just-threatened-apple-with-a-25-tariff-here-s-what-could-happen-next/

Apple Shares Fall on Trump Threat: 'Make iPhones in U.S. or Pay 25%',1748008471000,"May 23 - Apple NASDAQ:AAPL shares dropped by as much as 4% in early Friday trading after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured domestically.The comments, posted on Trump's Truth Social platform, targeted Apple's offshore production strategy. He said iPhones sold in the U.S. should be built within the country. If that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S., he wrote.The post comes amid reports that Apple's key supplier, Foxconn (FXCOF), plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new facility in Tamil Nadu, India. The plant will reportedly produce display modules for Apple, part of the tech giant's ongoing efforts to diversify its supply chain beyond China.Apple has steadily expanded manufacturing operations to countries including India, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet",1747832340000,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 21, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) — as well as localized English for Singapore and India — and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company's prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.,1748007840000,"By Britney NguyenPresident Donald Trump said Apple must pay a 25% tariff if it doesn't rely on domestic production of iPhones for the U.S. marketShares of Apple Inc. were down more than 2% shortly after Friday's open after President Donald Trump threatened the company with a tariff if it doesn't make iPhones for the U.S. market stateside. One analyst called Trump's dream of domestic iPhone production a ""fairy tale.""""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) that I expect their [iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.""However, analysts at Evercore ISI said in April they didn't see iPhone production moving into the U.S., ""as the higher labor costs alone would drive a >50% increase in iPhone manufacturing costs"" - double the tariff Trump is now threatening to put on Apple.""This implies that even under a 50% global baseline tariff it would not make financial sense to produce the iPhone domestically,"" Evercore said last month.Earlier this month, the president said he ""had a little problem"" with the Apple chief during a meeting between the two in Qatar. Trump has taken issue with the iPhone maker's further expansion into India. Apple doesn't produce any smartphones in the U.S., but has been diversifying its supply chain away from China since pandemic-era lockdowns and as geopolitical tensions between the two countries have intensified. The company has moved production into countries including India and Vietnam, but the Trump administration is still pushing for the company to bring its manufacturing stateside.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.As Trump floated massive tariffs on goods imported from China earlier this year, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, pointed out that most of the components used in iPhones are made abroad.""If U.S. tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come,"" Ives said in an April note. An iPhone made in the U.S. could cost $3,500, Ives said - more than double the current $1,000 price tag.Ives reiterated his point in a note on Friday, saying that building iPhones in the U.S. ""would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of $3,500 if it was made in the US.""He estimated that shifting production to the U.S. would take between five to 10 years, and called the idea ""a fairy tale that is not feasible.""In April, analysts at Gimme Credit said moving some iPhone production to the U.S. ""cannot be done immediately.""""It would take meaningful time and money to build and develop the physical infrastructure,"" the analysts said. ""More importantly, it is doubtful that the U.S. could provide the necessary labor force, both in terms of quality and quantity.""The analysts noted that Apple would likely still have to import some components from China.India produced about 20% of Apple's iPhones - or more than 40 million devices - in the past year ending in March, according to Bloomberg. The company is now focused on sourcing most of its iPhones sold in the U.S. from India by the end of 2026, the report said.-Britney NguyenThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

'Fortnite' Game Returns to Apple App Store in US,1747826005000,"Apple NASDAQ:AAPL has brought back Epic Games' ""Fortnite"" video game on its US App Store, Fortnite said in a social media post. ""Fortnite is back on the App Store in the US on iPhones and iPads...and on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the EU!,"" Fortnite said.

Tariff Threats Seen as Increasing Risk to U.S. Credibility — Market Talk,1748007720000,"President Trump's new tariff declaration ""is a destabilizing threat that could do real, lasting damage,"" deVere Group's Nigel Green says in a note. ""Beyond the short-term volatility, there's a bigger risk unfolding: the risk of recession and erosion of US credibility on the global stage,"" he says. The dollar and Treasury yields went up a little after Trump's social media post threatening 50% tariff on the E.U. and 25% on imported iPhones, but remained below yesterday's levels. The 10-year yield is at 4.483% and the WSJ Dollar Index falls 0.5%. The greenback weakens 0.8% versus the yen and 0.3% against the euro.

Google AI Advances Cheered by Wall Street. Why the Stock Reaction Is a Different Story. — Barrons.com,1747825740000,"By Adam ClarkGoogle-parent Alphabet unveiled a flurry of artificial-intelligence features at its developers conference. While analysts were impressed, the stock market still seems worried about how AI might eat into the company's core search market.The headline announcements on Tuesday included the introduction of ""AI mode"" to Google's search engine for U.S. users and a premium AI subscription. That came alongside many features such as 3-D video calls, real-time language translation and digital assistants, as well as a new line of smart glasses.Alphabet shares were up 0.3% at $164.54 in premarket trading after falling 1.5% the previous day. However, Wall Street analysts said the event showcased the company's strength in AI development.The conference ""reoriented investors back to first principles, i.e., AI success requires a combination of engineering, infrastructure, and distribution, and Alphabet is well positioned across these areas,"" wrote KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson in a research note Wednesday.Patterson has an Overweight rating and $195 target price on Alphabet stock.Google said its ""AI Overviews"" feature has 1.5 billion monthly users and the evidence is that users shown such summaries subsequently use its search engine more frequently.""We believe these enhancements will resonate with users and attract advertisers through higher quality leads and improved monetization potential,"" wrote CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.That could help calm some fears about declining usage, triggered earlier this month when an Apple executive testified in a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google that searches in the iPhone maker's browsers fell for the first time in April.""Google is about to go through a tricky time as doubters call into question its search business, and there is a possibility that its shares get hit hard if the numbers wobble before getting back on track,"" wrote independent analyst Richard Windsor. ""This would represent a great opportunity in Google for anyone brave enough to take the other side of the permanently skittish market.""Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

European stocks fall as Trump proposes 50% tariff on EU imports; says talks with them ‘going nowhere’,1748007559000,"President Donald Trump on Friday said he is recommending a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in trade talks with the 27-nation bloc. The proposed tariffs would take effect on June 1 and mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Washington and Brussels.Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said, “The EU has been very difficult to deal with…our discussions with them are going nowhere!” The announcement came less than 30 minutes after Trump threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones if the company does not begin manufacturing them within the United States.The dual threats reflect Trump’s increasingly aggressive trade posture as his administration races to strike deals before existing global tariff agreements expire in July. Source: Truth SocialBrussels awaits scheduled call between EU and US trade representativesThe European Commission declined immediate comment, saying it would await the outcome of a scheduled call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, set for 15:00 GMT. The call is expected to be tense, as Greer reportedly plans to inform Sefcovic that recent EU proposals fall well short of US expectations.The timing of Trump’s announcement surprised many in Brussels. Just weeks earlier, the US had agreed to a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs, offering both sides time to negotiate. That truce was meant to stabilize markets following Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcement on April 2, which had already roiled investors by introducing a 20% tariff later revised down to 10%.Currently, EU exports to the US are only subject to the new “baseline” tariff. A shift to 50% duties would represent a dramatic departure and potentially provoke retaliatory measures from Europe.Market reaction swift and negativeThe financial fallout from Trump’s statement was immediate. European stocks fell sharply, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.9%. Germany’s DAX dropped 2.3%, France’s CAC 40 fell 2.8%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 lost 1.3%.Sectors most vulnerable to global trade volatility were hit hardest. Banking stocks sold off heavily, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale losing 6% and 5.5% respectively. Italian lender Unicredit was down 4.2%. The regional Stoxx Banks index slumped 3.6% as investors assessed the indirect risks to lenders from a potential economic downturn triggered by tariffs.Consumer cyclical and luxury goods sectors were also under pressure. Swatch Group and Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica were each down about 5%.Bond markets, a typical haven during uncertainty, saw increased demand. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell 8 basis points to 2.56%, while yields on French, Italian, and Swiss bonds also declined.Bond yields move inversely to prices, meaning investors were moving money into safer assets.Economists warn of stagflation risksCommenting on the potential consequences of such high tariffs, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said, Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box , Goolsbee warned the tariffs could create a “stagflationary” scenario by increasing production costs and slowing output, all while raising consumer prices. “That’s the Central Bank’s worst situation,” he added.The EU was the second-largest buyer of US goods in 2022, importing nearly $351 billion worth of American products. A 50% tariff could severely impact transatlantic trade flows and unsettle multinational corporations relying on open trade channels.Trump’s broader strategy remains unclearThe Trump administration is currently in talks with over a dozen governments in an effort to renegotiate trade deals before automatic tariff resets take effect in early July. However, several foreign officials have expressed concern over Washington’s unpredictable demands, noting the difficulty in making concessions when tariffs can be reimposed without warning.Trump has long argued that European nations benefit disproportionately from trade with the United States. His push for “reciprocal” tariffs seeks to align duty rates, though critics say such measures risk igniting full-blown trade wars and undermining global supply chains.With less than two weeks remaining until the proposed 50% tariff would take effect, attention now turns to upcoming discussions between US and EU trade officials. A failure to find common ground could deepen the rift between two of the world’s largest economic blocs.",https://www.tradingview.com/news/invezz:5bb71649d094b:0-european-stocks-fall-as-trump-proposes-50-tariff-on-eu-imports-says-talks-with-them-going-nowhere/
