    "descriptionText": "Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it \"deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,\" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid \"the federal regulatory spiderweb.\"\"The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,\" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.
