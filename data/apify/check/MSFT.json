    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns.

The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let\u2019s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company\u2019s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia\u2019s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion.\u00a0Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4.\u00a0NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",
