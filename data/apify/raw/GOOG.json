    "descriptionText": "By Tae KimThe rapid progress in artificial intelligence means many large technology companies are currently facing their first big challenge since the dawn of the internet.And Google is in the crosshairs like no other. The biggest debate on Wall Street right now is whether Alphabet's Google search is being disrupted by AI-driven chatbots \u2014 and whether the company is up to the task of pushing back.This week, Google offered its most significant response with the introduction of a major change to its search engine. The technology looks generally impressive, but it still isn't enough.Google is facing the classic \"innovator's dilemma\": It is difficult for a business to move quickly to the next paradigm because the new model threatens to cannibalize the profit of the current business. And perhaps no one has ever had a business like Google Search. Last year, Alphabet generated $100 billion in net profit with the vast majority coming from its search engine, analysts say.But things are changing quickly. I'm now doing most of my information-related searches on AI apps like ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Perplexity, not Google. Alphabet investors have been skittish. Despite a 2% rise this week, the company's stock is down 10% this year. Among the Big Tech platforms, that decline is second to Apple's 22% slide, another company dealing with AI worries.At its I/O developers conference this past week, Google announced impressive new technology, but it was buried inside confusing product launches and conflicting business goals. The presentation was a case study in the innovator's dilemma.The company unveiled a new AI video-generation model called Veo 3, which impressed experts, along with coming features and capabilities such as data visualization, better personalization, and AI agent capabilities that can book a restaurant or sporting event for users.More significantly, Google introduced \"AI Mode\" for its core search engine. CEO Sundar Pichai said that AI Mode is \"a total reimagining of search,\" allowing users to ask more complex queries in a conversational chatbot interface similar to ChatGPT and Google's own Gemini, where follow-up questions can be asked.Google has been territorial about google.com ever since its 1998 launch, avoiding advertisements and clutter. So, any change to the page is significant. But given the stakes, AI Mode isn't significant enough. It's strangely hidden to users, so as not to actually encourage its use.To find AI Mode, Google users have to click on a small icon in the search bar or in a new tab on top of the site or app. Most users won't make the extra effort \u2014 and apparently that's OK with Google.The company is also putting many of its best AI features behind a new $250 a month subscription.Even the rollout of AI Mode feels symptomatic of Google's AI ambivalence. \"I'm excited to share that AI Mode is coming to everyone in the U.S. starting today,\" Pichai said live from the Google I/O stage on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts and reporters took Pichai at his word, assuming AI Mode would be available to everyone imminently. But that hasn't been the case. When Barron's reached out to Google asking why AI Mode wasn't available a day after Google I/O, a company spokesperson pointed to a blog post that said the rollout would happen \"over the coming weeks.\"In his book The Innovator's Dilemma, author Clayton Christensen explained how difficult it is for successful companies to maintain their relevance over time. History is littered with examples of incumbents moving too slowly when the next big technology shift arrives. Christensen wrote about how IBM dominated mainframes but then missed the emergence of minicomputers. No major mainframe company was able to become a leader in the minicomputer business.The same thing happened to minicomputer companies like Digital Equipment when the world moved to PCs.Here's the pattern: A start-up enters a niche market with a new paradigm and innovation. Large companies ignore the new area, given its small profit pool relative to current business. But as the start-up gains more customers, it can iterate new features and capabilities faster than weighed-down incumbents. Eventually, it displaces the more established company and the cycle begins anew.It's hard not to see the same pattern in play today as AI threatens search and Google takes tentative steps into the arena.It should make AI Mode the default option in its search engine and open its best features and models to all users.To be sure, the move would hit Google's results and its rich stream of search advertising. And that would hurt the stock \u2014 investors' short-term focus plays a significant role in the innovator's dilemma.But the longer Alphabet waits to lean in to AI, the worse off the company will be in the long run.Google should beat the innovator's dilemma by pretending it doesn't have an incumbent business to protect. If it maintains the No. 1 position in the future AI-driven search world, monetization will come.On Wednesday, the company said it was already testing ads for AI Mode. It's a promising first step.There's plenty more to do. Pichai said on a recent podcast that he had never read The Innovator's Dilemma.

At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4.\u00a0NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily i\u2026",

Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, \"fix the build error on apple platforms,\" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. \"How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?\" one developer asked on GitHub.\"We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,\" another developer on GitHub said. \"Is the ROI even worth it?\"The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: \"We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.\"As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.\"By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,\" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. \"We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.\"Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ:GOOGL has had a bumpy ride in 2025. While peers continue to ride the AI wave and outperform the market, Alphabet has struggled to keep up. Shares are down close to 11% year-to-date, underperforming the broader market and the technology sector. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:GOOGL] Concerns over competitive pressure in search, regulatory overhang, and questions about how quickly the company can pivot to AI-driven monetization have weighed on investor sentiment.Yet despite these challenges, Alphabet is far from standing still. Recent developments suggest the company is gearing up for a significant comeback and domination, particularly in artificial intelligence.\u00a0At its highly anticipated Google I/O 2025 conference , Alphabet made a flurry of AI-related announcements that showcased the company\u2019s technical firepower and signaled its intent to lead in next-generation computing. JPMorgan analysts took note, reiterating their Overweight rating on GOOGL and maintaining a $195 price target following the event.Google I/O Highlights: AI at the CenterThe Google I/O 2025 developer conference clarified that Alphabet\u2019s AI ambitions are more than just hype. The spotlight was on Gemini, Google\u2019s AI platform , which is quickly becoming a key pillar of its long-term strategy. CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Gemini now serves over 400 million monthly users and has attracted more than 7 million developers globally, a sign of growing traction and adoption.Major updates included the launch of Gemini 2.5 models, Flash and Pro, with improved reasoning capabilities, better multimodality, and tools for advanced code generation. New features such as \u201cDeep Think\u201d mode and the Gemini Ultra Plan, which bundles premium AI access with 30TB of cloud storage, are designed to attract enterprise users and developers.Google also unveiled a suite of AI-powered tools across its product ecosystem, from a conversational AI mode in Google Search to a Gemini browsing assistant in Chrome. The company also announced \u201cProject Astra,\u201d an all-purpose AI assistant capable of real-world task execution, like managing a calendar or diagnosing bike issues.Developer tools were another key focus. Google introduced Gemini Code Assist, a coding co-pilot designed. The no-code app development tool lets developers build from prompts or designs. These announcements collectively signal Google\u2019s aggressive push to create a robust developer ecosystem around Gemini.Expanding Into XR and Generative MediaBeyond core AI and cloud, Alphabet also made significant strides in extended reality (XR) and generative media. Through partnerships with Samsung and XREAL, the company is advancing into smart glasses and mixed-reality headsets. Project Starline, now rebranded as Google Beam, takes videoconferencing to the next level with 3D video calls and real-time translation.On the creative front, tools like Veo 3 for AI-generated video and Imagen 4 for high-fidelity image generation position Google as a major player in generative content.\u00a0Analyst and Institutional Support Building [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:GOOGL] The bullish takeaway from the I/O conference wasn\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. Of 40 analysts covering GOOGL, 30 currently rate the stock as a Buy, with the rest leaning toward Hold.The average 12-month\u00a0 price target is $199.75, implying a nearly 19% upside from current levels. Analysts widely agree that while near-term uncertainty remains, Alphabet\u2019s AI investments and product integration could drive long-term upside.Institutional investors are also positioning for a rebound . Over the last 12 months, GOOGL has seen $95.7 billion in institutional inflows versus $52.4 billion in outflows, yielding a substantial net inflow.In Q1 alone, $18 billion flowed into the stock.\u00a0 Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square increased its GOOGL position by 11.33% last quarter, now holding 4.4 million shares, another vote of confidence in Alphabet\u2019s trajectory.The Stage Is Set for GOOGL\u2019s ComebackWhile Alphabet\u2019s stock performance in 2025 has been disappointing, the story is far from over. The company\u2019s aggressive AI push, underscored by a strong showing at Google I/O , suggests it\u2019s still in the race to lead the future of tech. With strong institutional support , bullish analyst sentiment , and an attractive valuation relative to its peers, GOOGL may be setting up for a comeback that investors won\u2019t want to miss.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",

    "descriptionText": "The U.S. Justice Department is probing whether Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google violated antitrust law in its agreement with Character.AI that allows the tech giant to use the AI startup's technology, Bloomberg Law reported on Thursday.Antitrust enforcers have recently told Google they are examining whether the company structured the agreement with Character.AI to avoid formal government merger scrutiny, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Google last year signed a licensing deal with Character.AI that granted the search engine giant a non-exclusive license to the chatbot maker's large language model technology. The company also hired Character.AI co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, both former Google employees. \"We're always happy to answer any questions from regulators,\" a Google spokesperson said. \"We're excited that talent from Character.AI joined the company but we have no ownership stake and they remain a separate company.\"Character.AI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the DOJ declined to comment.The DOJ can scrutinize whether the deal itself is anti-competitive even if it did not require a formal review, the report said, adding the antitrust probe was in the early stages and may not lead to an enforcement action.Other tech giants have struck similar deals in the past year in their push for growth in the heated generative AI race. Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT struck a $650 million deal with Inflection AI in March 2024, to use the AI startup's models and hire its staff, while Amazon NASDAQ:AMZN hired AI firm Adept's co-founders and some of its team last June. Both deals had drawn regulatory scrutiny. Google is already under pressure from regulators, with the DOJ seeking to break up the company's dominance in the online search market and in digital advertising technology in two separate cases.Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission backed the DOJ's proposal to make Google share search data with competitors.",

U.S. stocks could soon get caught up in the selling as well, one former Fed trader warnsWide U.S. budget deficits have become a fact of life in the U.S., and increasingly, a crucial source of support for stocks.But one former Federal Reserve trader is concerned that this longtime tailwind could soon morph into a serious problem for investors.Already, the so-called bond vigilantes appear to be pushing back against the Republican budget plan. The plan includes tax and spending cuts, but would ultimately do little to curb the federal budget deficit.In response, investors have sent Treasury yields back to where they stood at the nadir of last month's tariff-fueled selloff as of Wednesday. So far, the selling hasn't been confined to the U.S.; yields on long-dated Japanese government bonds recently touched their highest levels in decades. Treasury yields move inversely to prices, rising as prices fall.See: 30-year Treasury yield is above 5% again - that is usually a bad sign for stocksThat pain appeared to spread to U.S. stocks on Wednesday, a phenomenon that some said could be poised to continue as investors grow increasingly weary of Washington's reluctance to get its fiscal house in order.\"Trump's upcoming spending bill would usually be positive for equities, but recent cracks in U.S. exceptionalism suggest that it could instead have the opposite impact,\" Joseph Wang said in a recent edition of his Fedguy.com Substack newsletter.Wang highlighted two examples that helped illustrate how investors have reacted differently to other instances where governments announced plans for more unfunded spending.On the one hand, Germany's recent embrace of deficit spending - something that the German people have long resisted - has helped fuel a massive rally in European stocks and the euro.But a more appropriate point of reference might be the market spasms that gripped the U.K. and toppled former Prime Minister Liz Truss back in 2022. Back then, Truss's decision to announce a mini-budget that included plans to cut taxes and increase spending kicked off a historic rout that sent British bond and stock markets reeling, while also weighing on the pound.As Congress moves closer to a vote on the Republican budget plan, a similar reaction might await U.S. investors, Wang warned. Although it is difficult to say with any certainty what might be coming, markets have recently been sending some alarming signals.Chief among them is the recent rise in long-dated Treasury yields. The yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was up 12 points on Wednesday, pushing it above 5%, a level that has been associated with stock-market pain in the past - most memorably, the correction that unfolded in September and October 2023. That episode was only halted when the Fed signaled plans to issue fewer long-dated bonds, while several senior officials teased the prospect of interest-rate cuts.These days, the Fed has been steadfastly on hold, and once again, expectations for the timing of the next Fed rate cut seemingly keep getting pushed back.Still, investors might have some reason for optimism. According to an analysis by Capital Economics shared with MarketWatch on Wednesday, the budget plan likely won't cause the deficit to increase. Further tax cuts will likely be offset by the administration's new tariffs.\"The upshot is that we expect the budget deficit to be broadly unchanged at close to 6% of GDP over the next few years, although that would still leave the debt burden on track to reach nearly 120% of GDP by 2034,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.U.S. stocks sank to fresh session lows in early-afternoon trading after a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields moving even higher.The S&P 500 SPX was down by 76 points, or 1.3%, at 5,863 in recent trade, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 204 points, or 1.1%, at 18,937.The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was off by 790 points, or 1.9%, at 41,890.-Joseph AdinolfiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company\u2019s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq\u2019s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella\u2019s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ\u2019s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\u00a0Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ\u2019s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ\u2019s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors.\u00a0Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ\u2019s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company\u2019s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ\u2019s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption. The recent 21% increase in share price following first-quarter 2025 earnings is more than just momentum; it reflects meaningful strategic progress.The $22-million commercial deal with EPB, expanding government partnerships like DARPA\u2019s benchmarking initiative, and acquisitions that bolster capabilities in quantum internet infrastructure all underscore IonQ\u2019s leadership in a rapidly evolving space.Despite high R&D expenses and integration risks, IonQ\u2019s nearly $700 million cash position provides the financial flexibility to pursue innovation aggressively without compromising its long-term vision. While the stock\u2019s valuation is lofty, the narrowing consensus loss estimates and reaffirmed guidance signal growing confidence in execution.For long-term investors willing to embrace volatility, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a company building the foundation of next-generation computing and secure communications.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "US equity indexes traded mixed after gains in Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG shares helped lift the Nasdaq Composite while domestic fiscal jitters weighed over government bond yields. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4% to 19,219.2 after midday on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to 5,933.2, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7% to 42,377.6. The communications services sector, home to Alphabet, was the top gainer and among the only two peer groups trading higher intraday. Utilities, energy, and financials led the decliners. Alphabet is an index constituent for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Google is rolling out an \"AI Mode,\" which answers queries in a chatbot-style conversation, Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said at a developers conference Tuesday. The option is being added as a tab within search and initially for US users. Shares jumped 5.1% intraday, the top gainer on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The yields on 30-year and 10-year US Treasury bonds rebounded above key thresholds that roiled markets in April after President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. The 30-year yield traded at 5.02% and the 10-year yield was at 4.54% intraday. BofA Securities analysts said they \"do not think that the [US sovereign credit rating] downgrade [by Moody's Investors Service on Friday] matters by itself, but it has served as a wakeup call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"House Republicans are girding for a vote on a messy budget reconciliation bill as soon as Wednesday night or Thursday, according to a note from Scotiabank. \"They still can't agree on the combination of tax cuts, spending cuts, and SALT deductions but are seeking to do so before heading off for the Memorial Day weekend,\" Derek Holt, head of capital market economics, said in the note. \"If it passes in the House, then it's unlikely to pass in the Senate absent big modifications.\"The ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's performance against the world's major currencies, fell 0.6% to 99.47. Further, in company news, Target's NYSE:TGT fiscal Q1 results fell more than estimated while the retailer slashed its full-year outlook, citing the impact of tariffs and uncertain consumer spending.

As earnings results kept rolling in, investors also reacted to the U.S. losing its top credit rating from Moody's, rising treasury yields, major announcements from some of the largest tech companies, and trade updates from President Donald Trump.The S&P 500 ended the week down 2.6% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.For tech investors, the highlight came from announcements by Microsoft at its Build conference and Alphabet at its Google I/O event. Microsoft investors were mostly focused on the company highlighting its artificial intelligence agents, while Google shareholders celebrated the introduction of AI Mode into search to compete with gen-AI chatbots.Wall Street has also been closely watching Apple stock, which dropped 7.6% this week. Shares fell 2.3% on May 21 after ChatGPT-parent OpenAI said that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI \"to create all sorts of wonderful things.\" For Apple investors, that brings new concerns about competition, thoughApple stock then declined 3% on Friday after Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the devices are made in the states.The coming week will bring earnings back to the forefront. Wall Street is anticipating first-quarter financial results and commentary from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday. Investors will want updates on how chip demand is doing in an uncertain economic environment, and they'll want to hear how trade and regulatory decisions may be impacting the company.Personal computer companies HP Inc. and Dell Technologies will also be reporting their latest financial results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Electronic products are currently exempt from the Trump administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, but that's not expected to last.Software company Salesforce will report earnings on Wednesday. Software results have generally been strong this latest earnings season, with executive teams providing better-than-expected outlooks, as enterprises continue to spend on AI initiatives. Salesforce investors will also be looking for updates on the M&A front, following a report on Friday that Salesforce and Informatica were back in talks regarding a possible acquisition.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

It also unveiled AI Mode for Search and Chrome, a generative-AI search experience that offers conversational answers, and launched a premium AI subscription for business users at $249.99 per month.Beyond Search, Google introduced Android XR for smart glasses in partnership with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, and rolled out Veo 3, its next-generation AI video model. CEO Sundar Pichai described these innovations as part of a total reimagining of search, but investors remain focused on the timing of commercial deployments and their impact on near-term revenue.Is GOOGL Stock a Buy Now?Based on the one year price targets offered by 48 analysts, the average target price for Alphabet Inc is $200.33 with a high estimate of $240.00 and a low estimate of $160.00. The average target implies a upside of +22.16% from the current price of $163.98.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Alphabet Inc in one year is $195.77, suggesting a upside of +19.39% from the current price of $163.98.

    "descriptionText": "By Joe Woelfel and Connor SmithStocks traded sideways on Thursday following narrow passage in the House of President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending bill. Treasury yields retreated.These stocks moved the most:Snowflake rose 14% after it reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings that were better than expected and revenue rose 26% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion. It was the cloud-based data storage company's first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter. Product revenue \u2014 derived from Snowflake customers' consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer \u2014 also increased 26% from the previous year to $996.8 million and beat Wall Street estimates. The company said it expects second-quarter product revenue of between $1.035 billion and $1.04 billion, higher than consensus of $1.02 billion.Fannie Mae jumped 47% and Freddie Mac rose 43% after Trump said he was giving \" very serious consideration\" to taking the mortgage giants public. The companies have been under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency since the 2008 mortgage-led financial crisis.UnitedHealth declined 2.1%, Humana fell 7.6%, and CVS Health fell 3.1% after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced it was expanding its auditing efforts for Medicare Advantage plans to crack down on overpayments. \"Beginning immediately, CMS will audit all eligible MA contracts for each payment year in all newly initiated audits and invest additional resources to expedite the completion of audits for payment years 2018 through 2024,\" the agency said in a statement.Enphase Energy fell 20%, First Solar was down 4.3%, and Sunrun dropped 37% as the tax-and-spending bill would end certain tax credits for wind and solar energy by 2028 instead of a slower phaseout through 2031, The Wall Street Journal reported. Sunrun also was downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at BMO Capital.Nike was up 2.2% after the sportswear company said it plans to sell products on Amazon.com's U.S. site for the first time in more than five years. Nike stopped selling to Amazon directly in November 2019 to focus on its direct business.Shares of Urban Outfitters jumped 23% after the conglomerate of apparel brands reported an increase in first-quarter earnings and sales. The company's three main brands \u2014 Anthropologie, Free People, and its namesake brand Urban Outfitters \u2014 each posted sales increases in the period.Alphabet was up 1.3%.

The company introduced a new \"user data shield\" feature and pledged deeper partnerships in sensitive sectors like defense through collaboration with local firms such as France's Thales, the news outlet reported. Google reportedly plans to roll out a similar initiative in Germany, building on its existing Data Boundary program that allows clients to control where data is stored and processed. The move follows growing concerns among European users that US tech firms could face pressure to limit access under future US administrations, especially amid renewed trade friction, the Financial Times reported. The news outlet quoted Google's president of customer experience as saying the company is responding to demand for \"layered\" sovereignty solutions as cloud usage expands beyond defense into broader industries.

    "descriptionText": "Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works \u2014 camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI \u2014 as an alternative portal to the web \u2014 is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem \u2014 how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the \"AI Ultra\" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was \"not budging,\" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - \"We're in center position,\" Daly said. \"My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in.\" - \"I am a person of action,\" Hammack said. \"But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands.\" Bostic was more definitive. \"I don't have a recession in my outlook,\" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. \"I think I've done enough,\" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has \"already turned around,\" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said \"I did what needed to be done.\"- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to \"hang tight and hold out\" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This \"good daughter,\" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college. If they choose not to go to college, the trust will remain till they reach 21. Should she still get an inheritance?- Sister/AuntRead the Moneyist's response here.- Quentin Fottrell***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert SteinerThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ:GOOGL has had a bumpy ride in 2025. While peers continue to ride the AI wave and outperform the market, Alphabet has struggled to keep up. Shares are down close to 11% year-to-date, underperforming the broader market and the technology sector. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:GOOGL] Concerns over competitive pressure in search, regulatory overhang, and questions about how quickly the company can pivot to AI-driven monetization have weighed on investor sentiment.Yet despite these challenges, Alphabet is far from standing still. Recent developments suggest the company is gearing up for a significant comeback and domination, particularly in artificial intelligence.\u00a0At its highly anticipated Google I/O 2025 conference , Alphabet made a flurry of AI-related announcements that showcased the company\u2019s technical firepower and signaled its intent to lead in next-generation computing. JPMorgan analysts took note, reiterating their Overweight rating on GOOGL and maintaining a $195 price target following the event.Google I/O Highlights: AI at the CenterThe Google I/O 2025 developer conference clarified that Alphabet\u2019s AI ambitions are more than just hype. The spotlight was on Gemini, Google\u2019s AI platform , which is quickly becoming a key pillar of its long-term strategy. CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Gemini now serves over 400 million monthly users and has attracted more than 7 million developers globally, a sign of growing traction and adoption.Major updates included the launch of Gemini 2.5 models, Flash and Pro, with improved reasoning capabilities, better multimodality, and tools for advanced code generation. New features such as \u201cDeep Think\u201d mode and the Gemini Ultra Plan, which bundles premium AI access with 30TB of cloud storage, are designed to attract enterprise users and developers.Google also unveiled a suite of AI-powered tools across its product ecosystem, from a conversational AI mode in Google Search to a Gemini browsing assistant in Chrome. The company also announced \u201cProject Astra,\u201d an all-purpose AI assistant capable of real-world task execution, like managing a calendar or diagnosing bike issues.Developer tools were another key focus. Google introduced Gemini Code Assist, a coding co-pilot designed. The no-code app development tool lets developers build from prompts or designs. These announcements collectively signal Google\u2019s aggressive push to create a robust developer ecosystem around Gemini.Expanding Into XR and Generative MediaBeyond core AI and cloud, Alphabet also made significant strides in extended reality (XR) and generative media. Through partnerships with Samsung and XREAL, the company is advancing into smart glasses and mixed-reality headsets. Project Starline, now rebranded as Google Beam, takes videoconferencing to the next level with 3D video calls and real-time translation.On the creative front, tools like Veo 3 for AI-generated video and Imagen 4 for high-fidelity image generation position Google as a major player in generative content.\u00a0Analyst and Institutional Support Building [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:GOOGL] The bullish takeaway from the I/O conference wasn\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. Of 40 analysts covering GOOGL, 30 currently rate the stock as a Buy, with the rest leaning toward Hold.The average 12-month\u00a0 price target is $199.75, implying a nearly 19% upside from current levels. Analysts widely agree that while near-term uncertainty remains, Alphabet\u2019s AI investments and product integration could drive long-term upside.Institutional investors are also positioning for a rebound . Over the last 12 months, GOOGL has seen $95.7 billion in institutional inflows versus $52.4 billion in outflows, yielding a substantial net inflow.In Q1 alone, $18 billion flowed into the stock.\u00a0 Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square increased its GOOGL position by 11.33% last quarter, now holding 4.4 million shares, another vote of confidence in Alphabet\u2019s trajectory.The Stage Is Set for GOOGL\u2019s ComebackWhile Alphabet\u2019s stock performance in 2025 has been disappointing, the story is far from over. The company\u2019s aggressive AI push, underscored by a strong showing at Google I/O , suggests it\u2019s still in the race to lead the future of tech. With strong institutional support , bullish analyst sentiment , and an attractive valuation relative to its peers, GOOGL may be setting up for a comeback that investors won\u2019t want to miss.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",

    "descriptionText": "The contest in Silicon Valley to dominate artificial intelligence is playing out on a new court: superstar researchers.While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters.\u201cThe AI labs approach hiring like a game of chess,\u201d said Ariel Herbert-Voss, CEO of cybersecurity startup RunSybil and a former OpenAI researcher who entered the talent fight after launching his own company. \u201cThey want to move as fast as possible, so they are willing to pay a lot for candidates with specialized and complementary expertise, much like the game pieces. They are like, do I have enough rooks? Enough knights?\u201dCompanies including OpenAI and Google, eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called \u201cICs\u201d \u2013 the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies.Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI\u2019s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech\u2019s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman\u2019s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources \u2013 both people and compute \u2013 behind the work he was excited about.\u201cIt was actually financially not the best option that I had,\u201d he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers. That hasn\u2019t stopped companies from throwing millions of dollars in bonuses and pay packages at star researchers, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever\u2019s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said.Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said. Google declined to comment.In contrast, top engineers at big tech companies receive an average yearly compensation of $281,000 in salary and $261,000 in equity, according to Comprehensive.io, a company that tracks tech industry compensation.10,000x TALENTWhile talent has always been important in Silicon Valley, the difference with the AI boom is how few people are in this elite group \u2013 depending on who you ask, the number could range from a few dozen to around a thousand, eight sources told Reuters.That is based on the belief that this very small number of \u2018ICs\u2019 have made outsized contributions to the development of large language models, the technology today\u2019s AI boom is based on, and therefore could make or break the success of an AI model. \u201csure 10x engineers are cool but damn those 10,000x engineer/researchers\u2026,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted in late 2023, alluding to a long held maxim that the best software engineers were 10 times as good as the average (10x), but now in the AI industry, the best researchers are 10,000 times (10,000x) as effective as the average.The September departure of OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, who then founded a rival AI startup, has intensified the AI talent war.

The two companies have expanded their strategic partnership to fast-track the commercial deployment of WeRide\u2019s Level-4 robotaxi services and boost their reach across global markets.This move builds on a previous collaboration in April 2024. Now, the focus is broader\u2014bringing self-driving technology to everyday users through Tencent\u2019s platforms like WeChat and Tencent Maps. Users will be able to hail a WeRide robotaxi directly from Tencent\u2019s Smart Transportation Mini Program.Notably, WeRide saw its revenues decline roughly 10% last year to $49 million. By tapping into Tencent Cloud\u2019s vast infrastructure and data capabilities, WeRide aims to strengthen both its R&D and commercial operations.With Tencent\u2019s cloud and mapping services, WeRide plans to tailor autonomous driving solutions for international markets, where it already holds a first-mover edge. Localized, compliant cloud services will help the company scale up its overseas presence more efficiently and reliably.Additionally, the companies will co-develop a data-driven platform that integrates cloud computing and advanced mapping tools. This platform will support end-to-end data compliance and accelerate the mass production of smart driving technologies.This expanded alliance with Tencent positions WeRide to move faster and further in the competitive autonomous mobility space, both in China and beyond. As the race to commercialize robotaxis intensifies, having Tencent\u2019s digital ecosystem and cloud power could be a game-changer.Competitors in the Robotaxi SpaceWeRide\u2019s deeper collaboration with Tencent is sure to catch the attention of its rivals like Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Waymo and Baidu BIDU.Alphabet\u2019s self-driving unit, Waymo, is the leading force in the U.S. robotaxi domain. The company has been operating fully driverless rides in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin. Alphabet is betting big on autonomous tech through Waymo, investing heavily in safety, mapping, and in-house AI to maintain its lead. Waymo is providing over 250,000 paid Robotaxi rides each week.In China, Baidu has firmly established itself as a powerhouse in the robotaxi space. Its autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, now boasts a global fleet of 1,000 vehicles\u2014a major milestone that highlights its growing scale and ambition. As of May, Apollo Go had handled over 11 million ride orders and extended its presence to 15 cities across China. While it continues to grow its Robotaxi footprint at home, Apollo Go is now setting its sights on international markets, signaling Baidu\u2019s intent to become a global player in the self-driving race.The Zacks Rundown for WRDShares of WeRide have declined 28% year to date against the industry\u2019s growth of 3.2%.From a valuation standpoint, WRD trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 9.68, way above the industry.\u00a0It carries a\u00a0Value Score\u00a0of F.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WeRide\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies a year-over-year uptick of 64% and 51%, respectively.

    "descriptionText": "Al RootUber Technologies stock fell Wednesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he didn't need to buy the ride-hailing company. Wait. Was that on the table?Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday afternoon in Austin, Texas, where Tesla plans to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in June. Faber asked why Tesla doesn't buy Uber to give its business an immediate boost.\"There's no need,\" answered Musk.Uber has created a digital platform to manage demand for rides and the supply of drivers. Musk says Tesla can develop an app of its own. What is more, \"we have millions of cars that will be able to operate autonomously,\" he said.Musk is referring to Tesla vehicles owned by regular car drivers, which will be able to operate autonomously when Tesla's full self-driving software gets good enough. He envisions Tesla owners renting out their vehicles to Tesla to make money when they aren't using them. It would be like Airbnb, but for cars.Uber stock lost 3.5%, closing at $88.67, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The effects of autonomous-driving technology have been debated for months. Fear about self-driving cars, and how they might affect companies such as Uber, likely reached its peak a year ago, around the time Musk announced that Tesla would host a robo-taxi event in August. The event was eventually held in October.From the end of 2023 into the summer of 2024, Uber stock declined about 5%.Still, Uber has its own self-driving strategy, announcing deals with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to Uber's networks in Austin and Atlanta. That helped calm investors' nerves. Coming into Wednesday trading, Uber stock was up about 55% from its summer 2024 lows.Investors are still waiting to see how the self-driving ride-hailing market works, but it doesn't have to be a winner-take-all market. For starters, fleets of cars are expensive. Musk believes one of Tesla's key advantages is all the car buyers who have already paid for Teslas. Having a partner like Uber could lower capital costs for Waymo, or even for Tesla.There is also something to be said for the Uber brand. \"Uber\" has essentially become the verb for using a ride-hailing service.Musk's comments might have surprised investors, a little, eliminating any small price premium reflecting the long odds of a buyout.The challenge now is to understand and assess the development of the robo-taxi market in the coming years, and then to pick winners and losers.Uber is valued at $190 billion, more than General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis combined. Tesla is valued north of $1 trillion.Exactly how much is related to robo-taxis is hard to say. Most bullish Tesla analysts say a majority of the value is due to Tesla's AI expertise, which teaches cars to drive themselves.Alphabet, which controls Waymo, is valued at $2 trillion.

    "descriptionText": "By Joe Woelfel and Connor SmithStocks marked their worst day in a month after Treasury yields spiked in the wake of a weak auction of 20-year bonds.These stocks made moves Wednesday:Wolfspeed sank 59% to $1.28 after The Wall Street Journal reported the chip-component maker was getting ready to file for bankruptcy in the next few weeks amid struggles with its debt levels. The Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Wolfspeed was aiming to work out a Chapter 11 plan that has support of a majority of its creditors.Tesla fell 2.7%. CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday indicated he was committed to the electric-vehicle company. The chief executive told a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, and also said he would step back from political spending. Musk also told CNBC in an interview that Tesla was on track for a June launch of robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, adding the rollout would be slow.Nvidia was down 1.9%. CEO Jensen Huang again slammed U.S. curbs on the chip maker's exports to China. Huang said Wednesday at a news conference in Taiwan that U.S. measures designed to stop China from getting its hands on Nvidia's artificial-intelligence chips had been \"a failure,\" according to reports.Target fell 5.2% as the retailer's first-quarter adjusted earnings missed analysts' estimates and revenue fell 2.8% year over year to $23.8 billion for the quarter ended May 3. For the fiscal year ending in January, the company expects a low-single digit decline in sales. Past guidance called for sales to grow around 1% for the year.UnitedHealth declined 5.7% to $302.92. Shares of the health insurance giant were downgraded to Reduce from Hold by analysts at HSBC and the price target was cut to $270 from $490. The stock declined sharply last week after UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty resigned and the company suspended its 2025 outlook. The Wall Street Journal also reported the company was being investigated by the Justice Department for possible criminal Medicare fraud.Alphabet was up 2.8%. The company's Google unit, at its developers conference Tuesday, issued updates around artificial intelligence and how it plans to solidify its place in search. But many of the AI products announced by Alphabet won't come for a few months. Google's headline announcement was the implementation of artificial intelligence into search in what it is calling \"AI Mode.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said it was a \"total reimagining of search.\"Lowe's fell 1.7% after posting first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The company maintained its fiscal-year outlook but CEO Marvin Ellison flagged \"near-term uncertainty and housing market headwinds.\"Fair Isaac, the credit analytics company, dropped 16% after a Trump-appointed official expressed his disappointment with the company's decision to raise wholesale royalty fee for credit scores.VF Corp sank 16% after fiscal fourth-quarter revenue fell from a year earlier and missed analysts' estimates, and the owner of brands Timberland and The North Face said it expects first-quarter revenue to decline between 3% and 5%.Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates and raised fiscal 2025 profit expectations. Shares of the cybersecurity company were down 6.8%, however, after Palo Alto Network's revenue outlook for the fourth quarter missed estimates.Take-Two Interactive Software fell 4.5% after the videogame maker proposed an offering for $1 billion common shares.U.S.-listed shares of Baidu fell 4.3%. The Chinese tech company's growing artificial-intelligence business helped it top analysts' first-quarter earnings estimates.XPeng jumped 13% in U.S. trading after its first-quarter loss narrowed and revenue in the period more than doubled to 15.81 billion yuan. The company said it expects to deliver 102,000 to 108,000 vehicles in the second quarter.Earnings reports were expected Wednesday after the closing bell from Snowflake, Zoom Communications, and Urban Outfitters.Write to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By Katherine BluntGoogle is overhauling its iconic search engine to compete more directly with a wave of artificial-intelligence chatbots that threaten its core business.The company has started rolling out on its search page what it calls \"AI Mode,\" which answers search queries in a chatbot-style conversation without the standard list of blue links.The option, which Google announced at its developers conference Tuesday, is being added as a tab within search for users in the U.S.The change marks Google's most ambitious effort to date to confront the AI upstarts that threaten its flagship search product and largest source of revenue.\"It's a total reimagining of search with more advanced reasoning,\" said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google parent Alphabet. \" We are now entering a new phase of the AI platform shift where decades of research are now becoming reality.\"Many major tech companies are grappling with the prospect that generative artificial intelligence could disrupt their longstanding dominance, and face pressure from Wall Street to embrace AI.AI chatbots are fundamentally changing the way users search for information. In response to queries, OpenAI's ChatGPT and its competitors aggregate information in conversational responses. Users don't click on multiple links as often as they might while searching Google.Google has performed as much as 90% of the world's internet searches. It could lose traffic \u2014 and the advertising revenue that follows from it \u2014 if users shift to AI-driven alternatives.Alphabet shares slid sharply this month after an Apple executive testified in a federal antitrust case against Google that Apple would likely offer AI options such as ChatGPT or Perplexity in its Safari browser within the next year.To get ahead in the AI race, Google has been improving the capabilities of its own AI model and chatbot, known as Gemini, and adding AI features to many of its products.Google last year introduced \"AI Overviews\" to search. The feature uses AI to summarize traditional search results and usually is displayed at the top of the results page. It now has 1.5 billion monthly users, Google said.Google has been experimenting with \"AI Mode\" in recent months. It provides a search experience similar to what users would get from using other AI chatbots.Under the new rollout, people using Google search can hit on a tab to turn on \"AI Mode.\" It will run on Gemini.Google said it also plans to introduce a feature within AI Mode allowing users to upload a photo of themselves and virtually try on clothes while online shopping.Robby Stein, Google's vice president of product for Search, said the company is considering ways to include ads within AI Mode results. \"We view that as part of the content mix that people actually want,\" he said.The 2022 launch of ChatGPT set off a scramble among tech companies to invest in developing generative AI products.Investors have expressed concerns Google was lagging behind ChatGPT and other AI competitors in the early stages of the race, especially compared with rival Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI.Competition has intensified since. During his trial testimony earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue also said Google searches in Safari had recently fallen for the first time in two decades.Google has said it has seen an increase in total searches coming from Apple devices and platforms.AI chatbots aren't the only threat to the foundations of Google's business. Last year, the judge overseeing the federal antitrust case ruled the company was illegally maintaining its search-engine monopoly.The judge is now considering a range of potential remedies, including forcing the sale of the company's Chrome browser.Google executives said in court that the company has been buffeted by competition since federal prosecutors brought the case in 2020. Google presented in court data showing use of Gemini has surged in recent months but still significantly lags behind that of ChatGPT.Pichai testified that Gemini is trying to make up ground. He said Google hopes to enter into a distribution agreement with Apple by the middle of this year that would enable Siri to tap Gemini in responding to user queries. Apple already offers that option with ChatGPT.Write to Katherine Blunt at katherine.blunt@wsj.com",

    "descriptionText": "Apple AAPL next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.\u00a0According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver\u2019s screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available. Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL. YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Stock\u2019s YTD Performance\u00a0Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple\u2019s Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.\u00a0The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple\u2019s vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple\u2019s Prospects?Although Apple\u2019s business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company\u2019s strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter\u2019s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.\u00a0Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. QuoteApple\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector\u2019s 25.5X, Alphabet\u2019s 17.06X, Dell Technologies\u2019 12.41X and HP\u2019s 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.Price/Earnings (F12M)AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Trades Below 200-day SMA\u00a0Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple\u2019s near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company\u2019s prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineThis article is from the free weekly Barron's Tech email newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox.Burying the Lead. At Google I/O, the search giant's annual developers conference, Alphabet-unit Google unveiled its answer to new AI search engines like Perplexity and ChatGPT, which are nipping at its heels. But Google Search's new \"AI Mode\" was buried beneath a blizzard of other announcements, some more important than others.Let's sort through it.Grinding Its Way to AI Relevance. Despite a decade of heavy investment into AI, Google wound up racing from behind when OpenAI's ChatGPT leapfrogged it in November 2022. While we still await some of the most advanced products that were announced at I/O, Google's underlying AI technology seems to be catching up through heavy investment and rapid iteration.Handicapped. AI Mode is an important step in Google's battle to stave off new competition from AI search engines. It pairs the benefits of AI with the power of Google Search's unparalleled web index. But the implementation shows how the search giant is handicapped in this battle.Accessing AI Mode requires an extra click, which will likely reduce usage. In designing the new interface element, Google had to be careful not to break the search experience that users know so well \u2014 type and hit return. Perplexity and ChatGPT don't have a legacy interface to serve, and they can make the AI search experience more natural.Making AI Is Hard, but It's Easier Than Making Products. AI announcements at I/O included AI Mode, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini Live, Gemini in Chrome, Veo 3, Imagen 4, Flow, Beam, Canvas, Agent Mode, and that doesn't include experimental products like Project Aura and Project Astra.Without looking it up, can anyone tell me what all these things do, and why I should use them? The product branding feels removed from the use case, potentially leading to customer confusion.This gets back to Google's longtime problem with turning tech into products. As tracked by the website KilledByGoogle.com, Google has shut down 296 products over the years. It has had 13 messaging apps, four of which are still going.Google's challenge is bringing all these strands together in a way that makes a simple pitch to users, the same way Search did in 1997.Making Agents Happen. One loud-and-clear message from both Google I/O and Microsoft's Monday Build conference is that AI \"agents\" are where these companies see the future. Agents are apps that work on top of an AI language model, automating a series of tasks from simple commands. Microsoft is pitching them to its business customers, while Google unveiled Agent Mode for consumer use.For Google, it's vital to maintain control of these AI personal assistants. Once let loose in a browser, these agents can go everywhere a human goes, including searching on Google. The issue is AI agents don't care about Google's advertising. At some point in the not-too-distant future, a large portion of web traffic may be AI agents. All ad-supported services, including Google Search, should find that troubling.But if Google is the one providing the agents, it can monetize them, making up for the loss of human traffic on the web.This Week in Barron's Tech- Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals. Broadcom Isn't on the List. - Jensen Huang Says 'Deeply Painful' China Ban on Nvidia's H20 Chips Will Cut Sales by $15 Billion - Netflix Nears $500 Billion Market Cap. Why Its Stock Is Still a Buy Even at These Levels. - Reddit Stock Falls as Analyst Says Google Search Issues Are Likely 'Permanent' - Netflix Could Get a Boost From Live Events. J.P.

    "descriptionText": "By Joseph AdinolfiAs Republicans make progress on President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful' budget bill, bond markets are pushing back. U.S. stocks could soon get caught up in the selling as well, one former Fed trader warnsWide U.S. budget deficits have become a fact of life in the U.S., and increasingly, a crucial source of support for stocks.But one former Federal Reserve trader is concerned that this longtime tailwind could soon morph into a serious problem for investors.Already, the so-called bond vigilantes appear to be pushing back against the Republican budget plan. The plan includes tax and spending cuts, but would ultimately do little to curb the federal budget deficit.In response, investors have sent Treasury yields back to where they stood at the nadir of last month's tariff-fueled selloff as of Wednesday. So far, the selling hasn't been confined to the U.S.; yields on long-dated Japanese government bonds recently touched their highest levels in decades. Treasury yields move inversely to prices, rising as prices fall.See: 30-year Treasury yield is above 5% again - that is usually a bad sign for stocksThat pain appeared to spread to U.S. stocks on Wednesday, a phenomenon that some said could be poised to continue as investors grow increasingly weary of Washington's reluctance to get its fiscal house in order.\"Trump's upcoming spending bill would usually be positive for equities, but recent cracks in U.S. exceptionalism suggest that it could instead have the opposite impact,\" Joseph Wang said in a recent edition of his Fedguy.com Substack newsletter.Wang highlighted two examples that helped illustrate how investors have reacted differently to other instances where governments announced plans for more unfunded spending.On the one hand, Germany's recent embrace of deficit spending - something that the German people have long resisted - has helped fuel a massive rally in European stocks and the euro.But a more appropriate point of reference might be the market spasms that gripped the U.K. and toppled former Prime Minister Liz Truss back in 2022. Back then, Truss's decision to announce a mini-budget that included plans to cut taxes and increase spending kicked off a historic rout that sent British bond and stock markets reeling, while also weighing on the pound.As Congress moves closer to a vote on the Republican budget plan, a similar reaction might await U.S. investors, Wang warned. Although it is difficult to say with any certainty what might be coming, markets have recently been sending some alarming signals.Chief among them is the recent rise in long-dated Treasury yields. The yield on the 30-year bond BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was up 12 points on Wednesday, pushing it above 5%, a level that has been associated with stock-market pain in the past - most memorably, the correction that unfolded in September and October 2023. That episode was only halted when the Fed signaled plans to issue fewer long-dated bonds, while several senior officials teased the prospect of interest-rate cuts.These days, the Fed has been steadfastly on hold, and once again, expectations for the timing of the next Fed rate cut seemingly keep getting pushed back.Still, investors might have some reason for optimism. According to an analysis by Capital Economics shared with MarketWatch on Wednesday, the budget plan likely won't cause the deficit to increase. Further tax cuts will likely be offset by the administration's new tariffs.\"The upshot is that we expect the budget deficit to be broadly unchanged at close to 6% of GDP over the next few years, although that would still leave the debt burden on track to reach nearly 120% of GDP by 2034,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.U.S. stocks sank to fresh session lows in early-afternoon trading after a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields moving even higher.The S&P 500 SPX was down by 76 points, or 1.3%, at 5,863 in recent trade, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 204 points, or 1.1%, at 18,937.The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was off by 790 points, or 1.9%, at 41,890.-Joseph AdinolfiThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company\u2019s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq\u2019s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella\u2019s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ\u2019s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\u00a0Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ\u2019s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ\u2019s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors.\u00a0Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ\u2019s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company\u2019s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ\u2019s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption.

It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai\u2019s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues. These pilots are expensive to maintain and may weigh further on gross and operating margins.Moreover, while C3.ai trades at a forward Price/Sales ratio of 6.39, above the sector average, its long-term financial outlook has not materially improved. The increased loss estimates for fiscal 2026 and expectations of negative free cash flow for most of fiscal 2025 raise red flags for investors seeking sustainable returns. Given the uncertain timeline for profitability and the ongoing dilution risk from continued investment in sales and R&D, the risk-reward profile for C3.ai appears unfavorable at current levels. C3.ai currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

A pause in tariffs that reduced macroeconomic uncertainty also helped the stock. However, Adobe\u2019s near-term prospects remain challenging given stiff competition in the AI and GenAI space from the likes of Microsoft MSFT-backed OpenAI, as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions.\u00a0Adobe\u2019s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet GOOGL. Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Gen AI solutions.Stiff competition has negatively impacted Adobe shares, which have underperformed peers like Microsoft and document services & e-signature provider DocuSign DOCU over the past month, but outperformed Alphabet. Microsoft, DocuSign and Alphabet shares returned 24.9%, 20.9% and 8.2%, respectively, over the same timeframe. The challenging near-term prospect is expected to remain an overhang on the Adobe shares.ADBE Stock\u2019s PerformanceAdobe shares are also overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of D.\u00a0ADBE stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.28X compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s 6.14X, Salesforce\u2019s 6.61X, DocuSign\u2019s 5.69X and Alphabet\u2019s 5.90X.Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)So, what should investors do with Adobe shares right now? Let\u2019s dig deep to find out.Can Adobe\u2019s Innovative Portfolio Boost Prospects?Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns. Adobe launched Firefly Video Model-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, which leverages AI to instantly generate and expand the length of video and audio clips. Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe\u2019s prospects. ADBE is infusing Gen AI innovations across its portfolio, including AI-first standalone and add-on products such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly App and Services, and GenStudio for Performance Marketing. These factors are expected to boost top-line growth.Adobe Offers Positive Guidance for FY25Adobe\u2019s new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter).

    "descriptionText": "With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA\u00a0less than a week away, the chip giant\u2019s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let\u2019s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company\u2019s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia\u2019s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion.\u00a0Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4.\u00a0NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination offers security solutions that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently.However, GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online this year, cloud revenues are expected to witness increased variability. Regulatory headwinds like the lawsuit between the Department of Justice and GOOGL over Google Search are a concern. The DOJ argues that Google has inked anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine and plans to break up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android. DOJ's proposal doesn't bode well for Alphabet, given growing competition from AI-powered products like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity and Meta AI.The Case for Adobe StockAdobe's AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet. Nevertheless, Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns.Adobe launched Firefly Video Model-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, which leverages AI to instantly generate and expand the length of video and audio clips. Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe's prospects.Adobe's new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter). ADBE expects this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.GOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, ADBE's Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL's 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.43 per share, up by 8% over the past 30 days, indicating a 17.29% increase over 2024's reported figure.The consensus mark for Adobe's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined by a penny to $20.36 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 10.53% growth over fiscal 2024.Both GOOGL's and ADBE's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Alphabet's average surprise of 14.64% is better than Adobe's surprise of 2.53%, reflecting the good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: GOOGL Is Cheaper than ADBEBoth Alphabet and Adobe are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of C and D, respectively.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Alphabet shares are trading at 5.98X, lower than Adobe's 7.27X.ConclusionDespite regulatory headwinds, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. However, Adobe is suffering from the negative impact of stiff competition in the AI and Generative AI space as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Adobe, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineThis past week saw two tech titans fighting for attention with dueling developer conferences: Microsoft Build and Google I/O. Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI \"agents.\" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, \"fix the build error on apple platforms,\" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. \"How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?\" one developer asked on GitHub.\"We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,\" another developer on GitHub said. \"Is the ROI even worth it?\"The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: \"We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.\"As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.\"By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,\" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. \"We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.\"Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation.

    "descriptionText": "By Joe Woelfel and Connor SmithStocks traded sideways on Thursday following narrow passage in the House of President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending bill. Treasury yields retreated.These stocks moved the most:Snowflake rose 14% after it reported fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings that were better than expected and revenue rose 26% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion. It was the cloud-based data storage company's first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter. Product revenue \u2014 derived from Snowflake customers' consumption of compute, storage, and data transfer \u2014 also increased 26% from the previous year to $996.8 million and beat Wall Street estimates. The company said it expects second-quarter product revenue of between $1.035 billion and $1.04 billion, higher than consensus of $1.02 billion.Fannie Mae jumped 47% and Freddie Mac rose 43% after Trump said he was giving \" very serious consideration\" to taking the mortgage giants public. The companies have been under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency since the 2008 mortgage-led financial crisis.UnitedHealth declined 2.1%, Humana fell 7.6%, and CVS Health fell 3.1% after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced it was expanding its auditing efforts for Medicare Advantage plans to crack down on overpayments. \"Beginning immediately, CMS will audit all eligible MA contracts for each payment year in all newly initiated audits and invest additional resources to expedite the completion of audits for payment years 2018 through 2024,\" the agency said in a statement.Enphase Energy fell 20%, First Solar was down 4.3%, and Sunrun dropped 37% as the tax-and-spending bill would end certain tax credits for wind and solar energy by 2028 instead of a slower phaseout through 2031, The Wall Street Journal reported. Sunrun also was downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at BMO Capital.Nike was up 2.2% after the sportswear company said it plans to sell products on Amazon.com's U.S. site for the first time in more than five years. Nike stopped selling to Amazon directly in November 2019 to focus on its direct business.Shares of Urban Outfitters jumped 23% after the conglomerate of apparel brands reported an increase in first-quarter earnings and sales. The company's three main brands \u2014 Anthropologie, Free People, and its namesake brand Urban Outfitters \u2014 each posted sales increases in the period.Alphabet was up 1.3%. The stock rose 2.8% on Wednesday, bucking the stock market's slide, as investors \u2014 initially cool to the company's new artificial-intelligence offerings \u2014 warmed to its AI developments.Analog Devices was down 4.7%. The semiconductor company guided for third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.82 to $2.02 a share and revenue of $2.75 billion, plus or minus $100 million.

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet GOOGL and Adobe ADBE are infusing artificial intelligence (AI) into their core offerings. While Alphabet is adding AI to its search and cloud services, Adobe is incorporating AI into its creative products.\u00a0According to IDC, global spending on AI-supporting technologies will surpass $749 billion by 2028. IDC expects 67% of the projected $227 billion AI spending in 2025 will come from enterprises embedding AI capabilities into their core business operations. This bodes well for both Alphabet and Adobe stocks.However, both stocks have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions and volatility related to higher tariffs. Year to date, Alphabet shares have lost 12.2%, underperforming Adobe\u2019s drop of 6.2%.GOOGL and Adobe Stock\u2019s PerformanceSo, Alphabet or Adobe, which is a better buy under the current scenario?The Case for Alphabet StockAlphabet\u2019s initiatives to infuse AI in Search are noteworthy. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Circle to Search was available on 250 million devices, with usage increasing roughly 40% during the quarter. Since October 2024, monthly visual searches with lens have increased by 5 billion. AI Overview is currently used by more than 1.5 billion people monthly. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview\u2019s advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and a low-code tool offering Agent Designer. Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination offers security solutions that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently.However, GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online this year, cloud revenues are expected to witness increased variability. Regulatory headwinds like the lawsuit between the Department of Justice and GOOGL over Google Search are a concern. The DOJ argues that Google has inked anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine and plans to break up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android. DOJ\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t bode well for Alphabet, given growing competition from AI-powered products like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity and Meta AI.The Case for Adobe StockAdobe\u2019s AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet. Nevertheless, Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns.\u00a0Adobe launched Firefly Video Model-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, which leverages AI to instantly generate and expand the length of video and audio clips. Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe\u2019s prospects.\u00a0Adobe\u2019s new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter). ADBE expects this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.GOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, ADBE\u2019s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.43 per share, up by 8% over the past 30 days, indicating a 17.29% increase over 2024\u2019s reported figure.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for Adobe\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined by a penny to $20.36 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 10.53% growth over fiscal 2024.Adobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. QuoteBoth GOOGL\u2019s and ADBE\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Alphabet\u2019s average surprise of 14.64% is better than Adobe\u2019s surprise of 2.53%, reflecting the good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: GOOGL is Cheaper Than ADBEBoth Alphabet and Adobe are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of C and D, respectively.\u00a0In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Alphabet shares are trading at 5.98X, lower than Adobe\u2019s 7.27X.GOOGL and ADBE Valuation\u00a0ConclusionDespite regulatory headwinds, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. However, Adobe is suffering from the negative impact of stiff competition in the AI and Generative AI space as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Adobe, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\u00a0You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works \u2014 camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI \u2014 as an alternative portal to the web \u2014 is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem \u2014 how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the \"AI Ultra\" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was \"not budging,\" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - \"We're in center position,\" Daly said. \"My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in.\" - \"I am a person of action,\" Hammack said. \"But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands.\" Bostic was more definitive. \"I don't have a recession in my outlook,\" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. \"I think I've done enough,\" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has \"already turned around,\" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government.

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ:GOOGL has had a bumpy ride in 2025. While peers continue to ride the AI wave and outperform the market, Alphabet has struggled to keep up. Shares are down close to 11% year-to-date, underperforming the broader market and the technology sector. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:GOOGL] Concerns over competitive pressure in search, regulatory overhang, and questions about how quickly the company can pivot to AI-driven monetization have weighed on investor sentiment.Yet despite these challenges, Alphabet is far from standing still. Recent developments suggest the company is gearing up for a significant comeback and domination, particularly in artificial intelligence.\u00a0At its highly anticipated Google I/O 2025 conference , Alphabet made a flurry of AI-related announcements that showcased the company\u2019s technical firepower and signaled its intent to lead in next-generation computing. JPMorgan analysts took note, reiterating their Overweight rating on GOOGL and maintaining a $195 price target following the event.Google I/O Highlights: AI at the CenterThe Google I/O 2025 developer conference clarified that Alphabet\u2019s AI ambitions are more than just hype. The spotlight was on Gemini, Google\u2019s AI platform , which is quickly becoming a key pillar of its long-term strategy. CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Gemini now serves over 400 million monthly users and has attracted more than 7 million developers globally, a sign of growing traction and adoption.Major updates included the launch of Gemini 2.5 models, Flash and Pro, with improved reasoning capabilities, better multimodality, and tools for advanced code generation. New features such as \u201cDeep Think\u201d mode and the Gemini Ultra Plan, which bundles premium AI access with 30TB of cloud storage, are designed to attract enterprise users and developers.Google also unveiled a suite of AI-powered tools across its product ecosystem, from a conversational AI mode in Google Search to a Gemini browsing assistant in Chrome. The company also announced \u201cProject Astra,\u201d an all-purpose AI assistant capable of real-world task execution, like managing a calendar or diagnosing bike issues.Developer tools were another key focus. Google introduced Gemini Code Assist, a coding co-pilot designed. The no-code app development tool lets developers build from prompts or designs. These announcements collectively signal Google\u2019s aggressive push to create a robust developer ecosystem around Gemini.Expanding Into XR and Generative MediaBeyond core AI and cloud, Alphabet also made significant strides in extended reality (XR) and generative media. Through partnerships with Samsung and XREAL, the company is advancing into smart glasses and mixed-reality headsets. Project Starline, now rebranded as Google Beam, takes videoconferencing to the next level with 3D video calls and real-time translation.On the creative front, tools like Veo 3 for AI-generated video and Imagen 4 for high-fidelity image generation position Google as a major player in generative content.\u00a0Analyst and Institutional Support Building [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:GOOGL] The bullish takeaway from the I/O conference wasn\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. Of 40 analysts covering GOOGL, 30 currently rate the stock as a Buy, with the rest leaning toward Hold.The average 12-month\u00a0 price target is $199.75, implying a nearly 19% upside from current levels. Analysts widely agree that while near-term uncertainty remains, Alphabet\u2019s AI investments and product integration could drive long-term upside.Institutional investors are also positioning for a rebound . Over the last 12 months, GOOGL has seen $95.7 billion in institutional inflows versus $52.4 billion in outflows, yielding a substantial net inflow.In Q1 alone, $18 billion flowed into the stock.\u00a0 Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square increased its GOOGL position by 11.33% last quarter, now holding 4.4 million shares, another vote of confidence in Alphabet\u2019s trajectory.The Stage Is Set for GOOGL\u2019s ComebackWhile Alphabet\u2019s stock performance in 2025 has been disappointing, the story is far from over. The company\u2019s aggressive AI push, underscored by a strong showing at Google I/O , suggests it\u2019s still in the race to lead the future of tech. With strong institutional support , bullish analyst sentiment , and an attractive valuation relative to its peers, GOOGL may be setting up for a comeback that investors won\u2019t want to miss.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",

    "descriptionText": "The contest in Silicon Valley to dominate artificial intelligence is playing out on a new court: superstar researchers.While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters.\u201cThe AI labs approach hiring like a game of chess,\u201d said Ariel Herbert-Voss, CEO of cybersecurity startup RunSybil and a former OpenAI researcher who entered the talent fight after launching his own company. \u201cThey want to move as fast as possible, so they are willing to pay a lot for candidates with specialized and complementary expertise, much like the game pieces. They are like, do I have enough rooks? Enough knights?\u201dCompanies including OpenAI and Google, eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called \u201cICs\u201d \u2013 the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies.Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI\u2019s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech\u2019s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman\u2019s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources \u2013 both people and compute \u2013 behind the work he was excited about.\u201cIt was actually financially not the best option that I had,\u201d he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers. That hasn\u2019t stopped companies from throwing millions of dollars in bonuses and pay packages at star researchers, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever\u2019s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said.Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said. Google declined to comment.In contrast, top engineers at big tech companies receive an average yearly compensation of $281,000 in salary and $261,000 in equity, according to Comprehensive.io, a company that tracks tech industry compensation.10,000x TALENTWhile talent has always been important in Silicon Valley, the difference with the AI boom is how few people are in this elite group \u2013 depending on who you ask, the number could range from a few dozen to around a thousand, eight sources told Reuters.That is based on the belief that this very small number of \u2018ICs\u2019 have made outsized contributions to the development of large language models, the technology today\u2019s AI boom is based on, and therefore could make or break the success of an AI model. \u201csure 10x engineers are cool but damn those 10,000x engineer/researchers\u2026,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman tweeted in late 2023, alluding to a long held maxim that the best software engineers were 10 times as good as the average (10x), but now in the AI industry, the best researchers are 10,000 times (10,000x) as effective as the average.The September departure of OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, Mira Murati, who then founded a rival AI startup, has intensified the AI talent war. Murati, who was known at OpenAI for her management skills and execution prowess, recruited 20 OpenAI employees before announcing her company in February. She has now lured even more researchers from OpenAI and other labs, and the team is now around 60 people, two sources told Reuters. Though the company has no product in the market, Murati is in the middle of closing record-breaking seed round that is, based on the team\u2019s strength. A representative for Murati declined to comment.The scarcity of talent has forced companies to approach hiring creatively. Zeki Data, a data firm focused on identifying top AI talent, said it is employing sports industry data analysis techniques like the one popularized by the movie \"Moneyball\" to identify promising but undiscovered talent. For instance, Zeki Data discovered Anthropic has been hiring researchers with theoretical physics backgrounds, and other AI companies have hired individuals with quantum computing backgrounds.Anthropic did not reply to a request for comment.\u201cOn my team, I have extraordinarily talented mathematicians who wouldn't have come to this field if it weren't for the fast progress that we're seeing now,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, who left his role as vice president of GenAI research at Microsoft last year to join OpenAI. \u201cWe're seeing an influx of talent from all fields going into AI now.

    "descriptionText": "Vietnam's Trade Minister Nguyen Hong Dien met officials of U.S. firms such as Excelerate Energy NYSE:EE , Lockheed Martin NYSE:LMT , SpaceX and Google NASDAQ:GOOG during a trip to Washington for tariff negotiations with the Trump administration, state media said on Wednesday.Vietnam wants the meetings to show President Donald Trump that it wishes to boost ties with the U.S. and facilitate U.S. investment in the country, Vietnam News Agency reported.\"The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Vietnam and the U.S. has been strongly promoting and creating favourable conditions for U.S. companies to invest and do business smoothly in Vietnam,\" the report cited Dien as saying. Vietnam and the U.S. this week started a second round of trade negotiations in Washington, as the Southeast Asian industrial hub seeks a deal to avoid a threatened 46% tariff rate on Vietnamese goods. Dien said Vietnam wanted to boost its cooperation with Lockheed Martin as the country plans to launch a new-generation communication satellite late next year, according to the report. Last year, sources said there were talks on sales of Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules military transport planes to Hanoi.At his meeting with SpaceX government affairs official Tim Hughes, Dien showed his appreciation for the company's plan to invest $1.5 billion in Starlink satellite services in the country, and urged it to expand investment to other areas such as clean energy, information technology and high-tech training.Meeting with Excelerate executives, Dien said the company's plan to sell American liquefied natural gas to Vietnam is in line with the country's energy development strategy. Hanoi has implemented several measures to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., which exceeded $123 billion last year, including by cutting tariffs on U.S. goods and tackling shipments of Chinese goods to the U.S. via its territory.The finance ministry said on Tuesday Vietnamese companies are also planning to build logistics centres and an industrial park in the U.S. to facilitate bilateral trade and investment.",

Barron's was able to see and try the redesigned Google.com home page this week.When asked for comment about the new \"AI Mode\" rollout on Google.com, a Google spokesperson said: \"We often test different ways for people to access our helpful features. This is just one of many experiments, and it's limited to Labs users only.\"Google often runs tests that may not be launched to its broader user base.But the company seems to be taking this particular test seriously. In a recent interview, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai suggested \"AI Mode\" may become an important search paradigm for Google.We're testing \"this whole new dedicated AI experience called 'AI Mode' coming to search,\" Pichai said on the All-In podcast published on Friday. \"In 'AI Mode' you can have a full-on AI experience in search including follow on conversational queries.\"The future of Google's search in an AI-focused world has been one of the biggest debates on Wall Street in recent weeks.Alphabet shares fell 6.9% last week after Apple executive Eddy Cue testified in court that Google searches via Apple browsers fell for the first time ever in April as more people turned to AI chatbots for their search queries. The remark accelerated worries among investors that Google's search dominance was finally facing disruption.Shares have rebounded 9% this week, amid a broader rally for tech and as investors look forward to the company's annual developers conference, Google I/O, next week.In his podcast interview published Friday, Pichai said that AI-Mode would be one topic of conversation at the coming conference.Alphabet shares were up 1.4% in mid-day trading on Friday.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata\u2019s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues \u2014 highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company\u2019s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% \u2014 demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology \u2014 each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management\u2019s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD\u2019s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts\u2019 bearish sentiments about the stock. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Magnitude - Consensus Estimate TrendINOD\u2019s Valuation Looks StretchedInnodata's current valuation seems stretched, as evidenced by its one-year forward price-to-sales ratio of 4.31 \u2014 well above the Zacks Computer \u2013 Services industry average of 1.76. This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company\u2019s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere\u2019s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata.\u00a0With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit.

AMD expects approximately $700 million reduction in second-quarter 2025 revenues due to halted MI308X shipments to China.AMD\u2019s Earnings Estimates Trend DownwardThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD\u2019s second-quarter 2025 earnings is currently pegged at 65 cents per share, which has decreased 35% over the past 30 days, indicating a year-over-year decline of 5.80%.The consensus mark for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $7.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.99%.\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and ConsensusAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. QuoteAMD beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.30%.AMD Stock OvervaluedAMD stock is currently overvalued, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.The stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 5.53X compared with the industry\u2019s 3.31X.Price/Sales (F12M)Conclusion: Hold AMD Stock for NowAMD\u2019s expanding portfolio, strategic acquisitions and rich partner base are expected to improve its top-line growth.\u00a0However, its near-term prospects are dull due to macroeconomic uncertainties and stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA in the cloud data center and AI chip markets. The growing demand for custom AI chips, offered by companies like Broadcom, is increasing concerns over market share. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.\u00a0AMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

NBIS will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 20, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 45 cents. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past seven days but has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $63.8 million.Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company. Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS\u2019 Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS\u2019 Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will \u200dboast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.

The two companies have expanded their strategic partnership to fast-track the commercial deployment of WeRide\u2019s Level-4 robotaxi services and boost their reach across global markets.This move builds on a previous collaboration in April 2024. Now, the focus is broader\u2014bringing self-driving technology to everyday users through Tencent\u2019s platforms like WeChat and Tencent Maps. Users will be able to hail a WeRide robotaxi directly from Tencent\u2019s Smart Transportation Mini Program.Notably, WeRide saw its revenues decline roughly 10% last year to $49 million. By tapping into Tencent Cloud\u2019s vast infrastructure and data capabilities, WeRide aims to strengthen both its R&D and commercial operations.With Tencent\u2019s cloud and mapping services, WeRide plans to tailor autonomous driving solutions for international markets, where it already holds a first-mover edge. Localized, compliant cloud services will help the company scale up its overseas presence more efficiently and reliably.Additionally, the companies will co-develop a data-driven platform that integrates cloud computing and advanced mapping tools. This platform will support end-to-end data compliance and accelerate the mass production of smart driving technologies.This expanded alliance with Tencent positions WeRide to move faster and further in the competitive autonomous mobility space, both in China and beyond. As the race to commercialize robotaxis intensifies, having Tencent\u2019s digital ecosystem and cloud power could be a game-changer.Competitors in the Robotaxi SpaceWeRide\u2019s deeper collaboration with Tencent is sure to catch the attention of its rivals like Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Waymo and Baidu BIDU.Alphabet\u2019s self-driving unit, Waymo, is the leading force in the U.S. robotaxi domain. The company has been operating fully driverless rides in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin. Alphabet is betting big on autonomous tech through Waymo, investing heavily in safety, mapping, and in-house AI to maintain its lead. Waymo is providing over 250,000 paid Robotaxi rides each week.In China, Baidu has firmly established itself as a powerhouse in the robotaxi space. Its autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, now boasts a global fleet of 1,000 vehicles\u2014a major milestone that highlights its growing scale and ambition. As of May, Apollo Go had handled over 11 million ride orders and extended its presence to 15 cities across China. While it continues to grow its Robotaxi footprint at home, Apollo Go is now setting its sights on international markets, signaling Baidu\u2019s intent to become a global player in the self-driving race.The Zacks Rundown for WRDShares of WeRide have declined 28% year to date against the industry\u2019s growth of 3.2%.From a valuation standpoint, WRD trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 9.68, way above the industry.\u00a0It carries a\u00a0Value Score\u00a0of F.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WeRide\u2019s 2025 and 2026 earnings implies a year-over-year uptick of 64% and 51%, respectively.

    "descriptionText": "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL \u2013 May 16, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares AppLovin Corp. APP as the Bull of the Day and Boise Cascade BCC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on AppLovin Corp. APP, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:AppLovin Corp. is an artificial intelligence-boosted tech stock that outclimbed Nvidia and other Wall Street darlings over the last three years, soaring 880%.APP posted another impressive beat-and-raise quarter on May 7 as the digital app monetization powerhouse flexes its growth as customers flock to its offerings to get ahead in a cut-throat segment of the digital economy.The company and the stock have also fought back against multiple short-seller reports that came out earlier this year.AppLovin is firmly on the risk end of the asset pool, with the valuation to prove it.Wall Street has jumped headfirst back into all things growth from AI to nuclear energy upstarts, making AppLovin an enticing buy down 30% from its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target. The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level.AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more.Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin\u2019s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users \u201cin-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond\u201d to try to help them tap into a portion of \u201c1.4 billion daily active users.\u201dAppLovin\u2019s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm\u2019s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth.The Ad Tech Company\u2019s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP\u2019s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create \u201ccountless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user\u201d to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current \u201cstatic\u201d experience, where \u201cusers see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,\u201d to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company\u2019s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP\u2019s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company\u2019s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26.Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin\u2019s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin\u2019s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices.APP has fought against all the allegations and is \u201cfully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.\u201dIt hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining \u201cAlex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.\u201dAppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP\u2019s two-year surge blows away Nvidia\u2019s 360% and Meta\u2019s 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech\u2019s 40% and Meta\u2019s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin\u2019s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector\u2019s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.Bear of the Day:Boise Cascade is one of the top North American producers of engineered wood products and plywood. BCC stock has tanked over 20% in 2025, driven by macroeconomic challenges, industry-specific headwinds, and operational pressures.The engineered wood products powerhouse missed our Q1 2025 earnings estimate by 22% on May 5. It also offered disappointing guidance as part of Boise Cascade\u2019s extended trend of downward EPS revisions.What\u2019s Going On with BCC Stock?Boise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022, before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and a slowing housing market.The company\u2019s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively.Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted earnings dropped 59% YoY in the first quarter to $1.06 a share, missing our estimate by 22%. CEO Nate Jorgensen pointed to \u201cconstrained demand, difficult weather, and planned downtime at our Oakdale veneer and plywood mill\u201d as part of its rough quarter and downbeat outlook.Boise Cascade's consensus 2025 earnings estimate has dropped 18% since its Q1 report. Its 2026 estimate has slipped 13% since then, and its overall negative earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company\u2019s earnings are projected to fall another 31% YoY in 2025 on 2% lower sales.Stay Away from Boise Cascade Stock for Now?Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. The company also pays dividends and has a sturdy balance sheet.Investors might want to put Boise Cascade on their watchlists since it could be a longer-term winner. Unfortunately, BCC faces near-term headwinds driven by weak housing market demand, economic uncertainty, and more.Additional content:AppLovin Stock Plunges -26% in 3 Months: Is It a Buy Now?AppLovin Corp. has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry\u2019s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP\u2019s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin\u2019s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand.Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP\u2019s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin\u2019s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP\u2019s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the previous years.APP Is a BuyAPP presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its impressive financial performance and robust growth prospects. The company's recent results and strategic initiatives underscore its potential for continued success in the gaming and software sectors. AppLovin\u2019s strong fundamentals, innovative technology and strategic growth initiatives position it as a leader in its industry.

The stock is down nearly 13% year-to-date , though it has rebounded over 9% in the past week , trimming earlier losses.A key blow came on May 7, when Apple\u2019s SVP of services, Eddy Cue, confirmed that the company is exploring AI-powered alternatives to Google Search in its Safari browser. That\u2019s no small matter for Alphabet, which pays Apple an estimated $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine, a relationship that supports roughly 36% of Google\u2019s mobile search ad revenue .Adding to the uncertainty, Alphabet faces rising pressure from AI-based competitors like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Elon Musk\u2019s Grok , which are starting to encroach on traditional search . However, the company has been proactive in adapting to the changing landscape.Alphabet\u2019s Gemini, its flagship large language model, has become central to its AI strategy. According to management's recent earnings call , AI Overviews, its integration of generative AI into Google Search, now reaches over 1.5 billion users across 140 countries and is monetized comparably to traditional results.Meanwhile, the company's other revenue streams continue to show strength . YouTube ad revenue surged to $10.47 billion last quarter, driven by growing subscriptions and user engagement . Once a laggard compared to peers like Amazon AWS , Google Cloud is gaining traction with enterprise adoption of its AI-powered solutions.Even Waymo , Alphabet\u2019s autonomous driving unit, is expanding operations across more than 10 U.S. cities , pointing to long-term optionality beyond search and ads.Analysts See Value in Alphabet\u2019s Valuation [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:GOOGL] While macro and competitive pressures have weighed on the stock, Alphabet\u2019s fundamentals remain strong , and analysts are paying attention.One of the most compelling aspects of GOOGL at current levels is its valuation.\u00a0Historically, the stock has traded at an\u00a0 average P/E of 28 over the past decade. Today, its forward P/E is just 16.25 , and its trailing P/E sits at 18.4 , levels typically reserved for more mature, slower-growth companies.This discount is drawing analyst interest. According to data from 40 analysts covering the stock , the average price target for GOOGL is $199.75 , representing 21% upside from current levels.The stock also holds a\u00a0 consensus rating of Moderate Buy , with 30 analysts issuing outright Buy recommendations , reflecting continued bullishness from Wall Street despite recent turbulence.Institutions Are Still Accumulating GOOGLPerhaps even more telling than analyst sentiment is the behavior of institutional investors . Despite the stock\u2019s drawdown and underperformance compared to some of its Magnificent Seven peers, institutions have not been dumping Alphabet shares.

    "descriptionText": "US equity benchmarks fell Wednesday, while bond yields climbed amid concerns that President Donald Trump's proposed tax-cut bill would increase budget deficits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.9% lower at 41,860.4, while the S&P 500 declined 1.6% to 5,844.6. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4% to 18,872.6. Barring communication services, all sectors ended in the red, with real estate, health care, and financials down more than 2% each. Treasury yields were higher, with the 10-year rate jumping 10.4 basis points to 4.60% and the two-year rate advancing 4.5 basis point to 4.02%. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the tax and immigration bill would add $2.3 trillion to the country's deficit over 10 years, The Washington Post reported. House Republicans and the White House were pushing for a vote on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, certain Republicans were headed to the White House amid concerns that the bill doesn't adequately lower spending, Reuters reported. \"Treasury yields surged amid growing fiscal anxiety as standoff over (Trump's) tax-cut bill unfolds,\" D.A. Davidson said in a morning client note. The package is \"unlikely to pass in the Senate absent big modifications,\" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was down 1.1% at $61.36 a barrel. Government data showed a surprise build in US commercial crude stockpiles last week. Oil prices gained earlier in the day following reports of potential strikes by Israel on Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday rejected US demands to halt uranium enrichment, Reuters reported. In company news, UnitedHealth Group NYSE:UNH shares were down 5.8%, the biggest drop on the Dow. The health insurance giant allegedly paid thousands of dollars in bonuses to nursing homes where it installed its own medical teams and pressured them to help cut care expenses for residents, the Guardian reported. \"The US Department of Justice investigated these allegations, interviewed witnesses, and obtained thousands of documents that demonstrated the significant factual inaccuracies in the allegations,\" a spokesperson said to MT Newswires in an emailed response. \"After reviewing all the evidence during its multi-year investigation, the Department of Justice declined to pursue the matter.\"Target's NYSE:TGT fiscal first-quarter results fell more than Wall Street's estimates, while the retailer slashed its full-year outlook, citing the impact of tariffs and uncertain consumer spending. Its shares slumped 5.2%. Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG class A and C shares were 2.8% and 2.9% higher, respectively, the top gainers on the S&P 500.

Faber asked why Tesla doesn't buy Uber to give its business an immediate boost.\"There's no need,\" answered Musk.Uber has created a digital platform to manage demand for rides and the supply of drivers. Musk says Tesla can develop an app of its own. What is more, \"we have millions of cars that will be able to operate autonomously,\" he said.Musk is referring to Tesla vehicles owned by regular car drivers, which will be able to operate autonomously when Tesla's full self-driving software gets good enough. He envisions Tesla owners renting out their vehicles to Tesla to make money when they aren't using them. It would be like Airbnb, but for cars.Uber stock lost 3.5%, closing at $88.67, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively.The effects of autonomous-driving technology have been debated for months. Fear about self-driving cars, and how they might affect companies such as Uber, likely reached its peak a year ago, around the time Musk announced that Tesla would host a robo-taxi event in August. The event was eventually held in October.From the end of 2023 into the summer of 2024, Uber stock declined about 5%.Still, Uber has its own self-driving strategy, announcing deals with Waymo to bring self-driving cars to Uber's networks in Austin and Atlanta. That helped calm investors' nerves. Coming into Wednesday trading, Uber stock was up about 55% from its summer 2024 lows.Investors are still waiting to see how the self-driving ride-hailing market works, but it doesn't have to be a winner-take-all market. For starters, fleets of cars are expensive. Musk believes one of Tesla's key advantages is all the car buyers who have already paid for Teslas. Having a partner like Uber could lower capital costs for Waymo, or even for Tesla.There is also something to be said for the Uber brand. \"Uber\" has essentially become the verb for using a ride-hailing service.Musk's comments might have surprised investors, a little, eliminating any small price premium reflecting the long odds of a buyout.The challenge now is to understand and assess the development of the robo-taxi market in the coming years, and then to pick winners and losers.Uber is valued at $190 billion, more than General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis combined. Tesla is valued north of $1 trillion.Exactly how much is related to robo-taxis is hard to say. Most bullish Tesla analysts say a majority of the value is due to Tesla's AI expertise, which teaches cars to drive themselves.Alphabet, which controls Waymo, is valued at $2 trillion. How much Waymo of that represents is hard to say. Most of Alphabet's money still comes from Google's search business. Still, Waymo's progress has been substantial. It completes more than 250,000 driverless rides a week and announced Tuesday it had passed 10 million fully autonomous paid rides.It is safe to say there are hundreds of billions, even trillions, of value at stake in driverless cars. That is a large enough market to keep investors optimistic about Uber.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let\u2019s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai\u2019s TailwindsC3.ai\u2019s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon \u2019s AMZN AWS, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft \u2019s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company\u2019s integration into Microsoft\u2019s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company\u2019s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense.

    "descriptionText": "IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company\u2019s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq\u2019s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella\u2019s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ\u2019s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\u00a0Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ\u2019s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ\u2019s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors.\u00a0Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ\u2019s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company\u2019s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally.

    "descriptionText": "(Updates with Alphabet's stock price movement in the last paragraph)Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google is enhancing its sovereign cloud services in Europe to help customers meet rising data security and regulatory demands, the Financial Times reported Wednesday, citing Google's statement. The company introduced a new \"user data shield\" feature and pledged deeper partnerships in sensitive sectors like defense through collaboration with local firms such as France's Thales, the news outlet reported. Google reportedly plans to roll out a similar initiative in Germany, building on its existing Data Boundary program that allows clients to control where data is stored and processed. The move follows growing concerns among European users that US tech firms could face pressure to limit access under future US administrations, especially amid renewed trade friction, the Financial Times reported. The news outlet quoted Google's president of customer experience as saying the company is responding to demand for \"layered\" sovereignty solutions as cloud usage expands beyond defense into broader industries. Google did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment. Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares were up over 4.60% in recent Wednesday trading.",

    "descriptionText": "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL \u2013 May 20, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL and Adobe ADBE.Here are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:GOOGL vs ADBE: Which AI-Driven Tech Stock Is a Better Buy Now?Alphabet and Adobe are infusing artificial intelligence (AI) into their core offerings. While Alphabet is adding AI to its search and cloud services, Adobe is incorporating AI into its creative products.According to IDC, global spending on AI-supporting technologies will surpass $749 billion by 2028. IDC expects 67% of the projected $227 billion AI spending in 2025 will come from enterprises embedding AI capabilities into their core business operations. This bodes well for both Alphabet and Adobe stocks.However, both stocks have suffered from challenging macroeconomic conditions and volatility related to higher tariffs. Year to date, Alphabet shares have lost 12.2%, underperforming Adobe's drop of 6.2%.So, Alphabet or Adobe, which is a better buy under the current scenario?The Case for Alphabet StockAlphabet's initiatives to infuse AI in Search are noteworthy. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Circle to Search was available on 250 million devices, with usage increasing roughly 40% during the quarter. Since October 2024, monthly visual searches with lens have increased by 5 billion. AI Overview is currently used by more than 1.5 billion people monthly. The addition of AI mode expands AI Overview's advanced reasoning, thinking and multimodal capabilities.Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and a low-code tool offering Agent Designer. Meanwhile, the Google-Wiz combination offers security solutions that are supported on multi-cloud and are expected to tackle threats emerging from the advancement of AI, prevent breaches and help enterprises respond to breaches more efficiently.However, GOOGL is suffering from a lack of capacity, and until new capacity comes online this year, cloud revenues are expected to witness increased variability. Regulatory headwinds like the lawsuit between the Department of Justice and GOOGL over Google Search are a concern. The DOJ argues that Google has inked anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine and plans to break up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android. DOJ's proposal doesn't bode well for Alphabet, given growing competition from AI-powered products like ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity and Meta AI.The Case for Adobe StockAdobe's AI business is minuscule compared with the likes of Microsoft and Alphabet. Nevertheless, Adobe has expanded its AI portfolio with Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, which help brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns.Adobe launched Firefly Video Model-powered Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, which leverages AI to instantly generate and expand the length of video and audio clips. Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe's prospects.Adobe's new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter). ADBE expects this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.GOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, ADBE's Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL's 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.43 per share, up by 8% over the past 30 days, indicating a 17.29% increase over 2024's reported figure.The consensus mark for Adobe's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined by a penny to $20.36 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 10.53% growth over fiscal 2024.Both GOOGL's and ADBE's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Alphabet's average surprise of 14.64% is better than Adobe's surprise of 2.53%, reflecting the good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: GOOGL Is Cheaper than ADBEBoth Alphabet and Adobe are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of C and D, respectively.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Alphabet shares are trading at 5.98X, lower than Adobe's 7.27X.ConclusionDespite regulatory headwinds, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. However, Adobe is suffering from the negative impact of stiff competition in the AI and Generative AI space as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Adobe, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

    "descriptionText": "By Tae KimThe rapid progress in artificial intelligence means many large technology companies are currently facing their first big challenge since the dawn of the internet.And Google is in the crosshairs like no other. The biggest debate on Wall Street right now is whether Alphabet's Google search is being disrupted by AI-driven chatbots \u2014 and whether the company is up to the task of pushing back.This week, Google offered its most significant response with the introduction of a major change to its search engine. The technology looks generally impressive, but it still isn't enough.Google is facing the classic \"innovator's dilemma\": It is difficult for a business to move quickly to the next paradigm because the new model threatens to cannibalize the profit of the current business. And perhaps no one has ever had a business like Google Search. Last year, Alphabet generated $100 billion in net profit with the vast majority coming from its search engine, analysts say.But things are changing quickly. I'm now doing most of my information-related searches on AI apps like ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Perplexity, not Google. Alphabet investors have been skittish. Despite a 2% rise this week, the company's stock is down 10% this year. Among the Big Tech platforms, that decline is second to Apple's 22% slide, another company dealing with AI worries.At its I/O developers conference this past week, Google announced impressive new technology, but it was buried inside confusing product launches and conflicting business goals. The presentation was a case study in the innovator's dilemma.The company unveiled a new AI video-generation model called Veo 3, which impressed experts, along with coming features and capabilities such as data visualization, better personalization, and AI agent capabilities that can book a restaurant or sporting event for users.More significantly, Google introduced \"AI Mode\" for its core search engine. CEO Sundar Pichai said that AI Mode is \"a total reimagining of search,\" allowing users to ask more complex queries in a conversational chatbot interface similar to ChatGPT and Google's own Gemini, where follow-up questions can be asked.Google has been territorial about google.com ever since its 1998 launch, avoiding advertisements and clutter. So, any change to the page is significant. But given the stakes, AI Mode isn't significant enough. It's strangely hidden to users, so as not to actually encourage its use.To find AI Mode, Google users have to click on a small icon in the search bar or in a new tab on top of the site or app. Most users won't make the extra effort \u2014 and apparently that's OK with Google.The company is also putting many of its best AI features behind a new $250 a month subscription.Even the rollout of AI Mode feels symptomatic of Google's AI ambivalence. \"I'm excited to share that AI Mode is coming to everyone in the U.S. starting today,\" Pichai said live from the Google I/O stage on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts and reporters took Pichai at his word, assuming AI Mode would be available to everyone imminently. But that hasn't been the case. When Barron's reached out to Google asking why AI Mode wasn't available a day after Google I/O, a company spokesperson pointed to a blog post that said the rollout would happen \"over the coming weeks.\"In his book The Innovator's Dilemma, author Clayton Christensen explained how difficult it is for successful companies to maintain their relevance over time. History is littered with examples of incumbents moving too slowly when the next big technology shift arrives. Christensen wrote about how IBM dominated mainframes but then missed the emergence of minicomputers. No major mainframe company was able to become a leader in the minicomputer business.The same thing happened to minicomputer companies like Digital Equipment when the world moved to PCs.Here's the pattern: A start-up enters a niche market with a new paradigm and innovation.

Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily i\u2026",

Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI \"agents.\" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, \"fix the build error on apple platforms,\" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company's prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Adobe introduced a new version of After Effects with a high-performance preview playback engine, powerful new 3D motion design tools and HDR monitoring. New Frame.io V4 upgrades include expanded storage that scales with teams.Adobe plans to monetize standalone subscriptions for Firefly through the introduction of multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering. Adobe plans to invest in its sales capacity to deliver Adobe-wide offerings across business, education and government. The integration of AI Assistant in Acrobat, Reader and Express bodes well for Adobe\u2019s prospects.\u00a0Adobe\u2019s new AI book of business (more than $125 million exiting the first quarter of fiscal 2025) was a roughly low single-digit percentage of total revenues ($4.23 billion in the fiscal first quarter). ADBE expects this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal 2025.GOOGL Earnings Estimate Revision Positive, ADBE\u2019s Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $9.43 per share, up by 8% over the past 30 days, indicating a 17.29% increase over 2024\u2019s reported figure.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for Adobe\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined by a penny to $20.36 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 10.53% growth over fiscal 2024.Adobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. QuoteBoth GOOGL\u2019s and ADBE\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, Alphabet\u2019s average surprise of 14.64% is better than Adobe\u2019s surprise of 2.53%, reflecting the good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: GOOGL is Cheaper Than ADBEBoth Alphabet and Adobe are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of C and D, respectively.\u00a0In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Alphabet shares are trading at 5.98X, lower than Adobe\u2019s 7.27X.GOOGL and ADBE Valuation\u00a0ConclusionDespite regulatory headwinds, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Its dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. However, Adobe is suffering from the negative impact of stiff competition in the AI and Generative AI space as well as a lack of monetization of its AI solutions.Currently, Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Adobe, which has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\u00a0You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

Google announced on Tuesday that it's integrating AI into its search engine through AI Mode \u2014 which will give users the ability to ask more complicated queries versus traditional searches in a conversational chatbot interface.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a Tuesday research note that the launch of AI Mode \"will provide answers to questions that users might otherwise click-through to Reddit links for more details.\" He lowered his price target on Reddit to $120 from $140 while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock.Reddit directed Barron's to Reddit CEO Steven Huffman's comments on the company's May 1 earnings call.\"We do expect some bumps along the way from Google because we've already seen a few this year,\" he said at the time, adding that as the \"search ecosystem is under heavy construction, the near term could be more bumpy than usual.\"Reddit stock dropped 2.2% on Tuesday and 9.3% on Wednesday following Google's announcement, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.4% and 1.6% on those days, respectively. Reddit stock was gaining back some of those losses on Thursday, rising 4% to $99.64.Reddit isn't the only company that could see further slowdown in active users following this Google update. Photo-sharing platform Pinterest could see a decline in traffic if Google's AI Mode shows users pictures that stop them from needing to look at Pinterest posts.\"Our ability to maintain and increase the number of users directed to our platform from search engines is not within our control,\" Pinterest said in its Risk Factor section of its most recent annual 10-K filing in February. \"Search engines, such as Google, have and may continue to modify their search algorithms...and policies or enforce those policies in ways that are detrimental to us.\"Shares of online education company Chegg have fallen sharply this year. The company alleged back in February that the rise of AI Overviews have \"had a profound impact on Chegg's traffic, revenue, and workforce.\" This led Chegg to sue Google. The latest AI Mode update can't be good news for the textbook seller moving forward.Chegg and Google both didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.AI Mode still hasn't been fully rolled out in the U.S., so now is the time for investors to decide whether the risk is worth taking for stocks that rely on Google clicks.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "What Does Pony.ai Do?Zacks Rank #3 company Pony.ai ( PONY ) is an up-and-coming leader in the rapidly growing autonomous driving technology industry. The Chinese-based company focuses on producing robotaxis for autonomous ride-hailing services, robotrucks for autonomous deliveries, and systems for individually-owned automobiles.PONY is the Top Performer Since the Market LowPrice is king on Wall Street, and one of the best methods to determine momentum is through a relative price strength analysis. PONY exhibits RS in spades. In fact, the shares have exploded from $4.11 on April 22\u00a0to nearly $20 today!Pony.ai Inks Uber, Toyota PartnershipsWhile Pony.ai is a relatively obscure and new company, it has already inked partnerships with two industry leaders. In its earnings call earlier this month, the company announced a partnership with rideshare leader Uber Technologies ( UBER ). PONY CEO James Peng touted the partnerships, saying, \u201cWe recently partnered with Uber, which will enable users to access our robotaxi service directly through Uber\u2019s platform.\u201d Meanwhile, late last month, the company announced that it has a deal with automotive juggernaut Toyota ( TM ) to begin mass production of its seventh-generation robotaxi lineup. The two deals provide Pony with two essential components: scale and distribution.PONY CEO Announces Voluntary Lock-up PeriodAn IPO lock-up period is a legal agreement that stops early private shareholders and company insiders from selling shares of a company near the IPO to prevent low stock prices and protect retail investors. One of the pitfalls of trading IPOs over the past few years is that early private investors use a successful stock debut as a liquidity event to dump shares on public investors once the lockup period expires. However, Pony.ai Chairman of the Board Dr. Jun Peng, and PONY co-founder and CEO Dr. Tiancheng Lou recently announced a voluntary lock-up period extending for 540 days beginning May 25. Though I have been involved in public markets for more than two decades, I have rarely, if ever, seen a voluntary lock-up period extension. This tells me that the upper-echelon management at Pony.ai has extreme conviction into the future.PONY Carves \u201cIPO U-Turn Base\u201dPONY shares are carving out a classic IPO U-turn base structure: the stock spikes higher, declines, and then rounds out a short, but powerful multi-week pattern.Image Source: TradingViewCoreWeave ( CRWV ) is a recent example of just how powerful this pattern can be.

    "descriptionText": "Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works \u2014 camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI \u2014 as an alternative portal to the web \u2014 is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem \u2014 how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the \"AI Ultra\" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was \"not budging,\" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - \"We're in center position,\" Daly said. \"My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in.\" - \"I am a person of action,\" Hammack said. \"But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands.\" Bostic was more definitive. \"I don't have a recession in my outlook,\" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. \"I think I've done enough,\" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has \"already turned around,\" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said \"I did what needed to be done.\"- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm.

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ:GOOGL has had a bumpy ride in 2025. While peers continue to ride the AI wave and outperform the market, Alphabet has struggled to keep up. Shares are down close to 11% year-to-date, underperforming the broader market and the technology sector. [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:GOOGL] Concerns over competitive pressure in search, regulatory overhang, and questions about how quickly the company can pivot to AI-driven monetization have weighed on investor sentiment.Yet despite these challenges, Alphabet is far from standing still. Recent developments suggest the company is gearing up for a significant comeback and domination, particularly in artificial intelligence.\u00a0At its highly anticipated Google I/O 2025 conference , Alphabet made a flurry of AI-related announcements that showcased the company\u2019s technical firepower and signaled its intent to lead in next-generation computing. JPMorgan analysts took note, reiterating their Overweight rating on GOOGL and maintaining a $195 price target following the event.Google I/O Highlights: AI at the CenterThe Google I/O 2025 developer conference clarified that Alphabet\u2019s AI ambitions are more than just hype. The spotlight was on Gemini, Google\u2019s AI platform , which is quickly becoming a key pillar of its long-term strategy. CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Gemini now serves over 400 million monthly users and has attracted more than 7 million developers globally, a sign of growing traction and adoption.Major updates included the launch of Gemini 2.5 models, Flash and Pro, with improved reasoning capabilities, better multimodality, and tools for advanced code generation. New features such as \u201cDeep Think\u201d mode and the Gemini Ultra Plan, which bundles premium AI access with 30TB of cloud storage, are designed to attract enterprise users and developers.Google also unveiled a suite of AI-powered tools across its product ecosystem, from a conversational AI mode in Google Search to a Gemini browsing assistant in Chrome. The company also announced \u201cProject Astra,\u201d an all-purpose AI assistant capable of real-world task execution, like managing a calendar or diagnosing bike issues.Developer tools were another key focus. Google introduced Gemini Code Assist, a coding co-pilot designed. The no-code app development tool lets developers build from prompts or designs. These announcements collectively signal Google\u2019s aggressive push to create a robust developer ecosystem around Gemini.Expanding Into XR and Generative MediaBeyond core AI and cloud, Alphabet also made significant strides in extended reality (XR) and generative media. Through partnerships with Samsung and XREAL, the company is advancing into smart glasses and mixed-reality headsets. Project Starline, now rebranded as Google Beam, takes videoconferencing to the next level with 3D video calls and real-time translation.On the creative front, tools like Veo 3 for AI-generated video and Imagen 4 for high-fidelity image generation position Google as a major player in generative content.\u00a0Analyst and Institutional Support Building [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:GOOGL] The bullish takeaway from the I/O conference wasn\u2019t limited to JPMorgan. Of 40 analysts covering GOOGL, 30 currently rate the stock as a Buy, with the rest leaning toward Hold.The average 12-month\u00a0 price target is $199.75, implying a nearly 19% upside from current levels. Analysts widely agree that while near-term uncertainty remains, Alphabet\u2019s AI investments and product integration could drive long-term upside.Institutional investors are also positioning for a rebound . Over the last 12 months, GOOGL has seen $95.7 billion in institutional inflows versus $52.4 billion in outflows, yielding a substantial net inflow.In Q1 alone, $18 billion flowed into the stock.\u00a0 Bill Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square increased its GOOGL position by 11.33% last quarter, now holding 4.4 million shares, another vote of confidence in Alphabet\u2019s trajectory.The Stage Is Set for GOOGL\u2019s ComebackWhile Alphabet\u2019s stock performance in 2025 has been disappointing, the story is far from over. The company\u2019s aggressive AI push, underscored by a strong showing at Google I/O , suggests it\u2019s still in the race to lead the future of tech. With strong institutional support , bullish analyst sentiment , and an attractive valuation relative to its peers, GOOGL may be setting up for a comeback that investors won\u2019t want to miss.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",

Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources \u2013 both people and compute \u2013 behind the work he was excited about.\u201cIt was actually financially not the best option that I had,\u201d he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers.

Google last year signed a licensing deal with Character.AI that granted the search engine giant a non-exclusive license to the chatbot maker's large language model technology. The company also hired Character.AI co-founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, both former Google employees. \"We're always happy to answer any questions from regulators,\" a Google spokesperson said. \"We're excited that talent from Character.AI joined the company but we have no ownership stake and they remain a separate company.\"Character.AI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the DOJ declined to comment.The DOJ can scrutinize whether the deal itself is anti-competitive even if it did not require a formal review, the report said, adding the antitrust probe was in the early stages and may not lead to an enforcement action.Other tech giants have struck similar deals in the past year in their push for growth in the heated generative AI race.

    "descriptionText": "Innodata Inc. INOD posted solid first-quarter 2025 results last week, with revenues rising 120% year over year to $58.3 million and EPS of 22 cents, beating expectations on both top and bottom lines. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 40%+ revenue growth and demonstrated substantial progress in expanding AI-driven services across multiple verticals.Specializing in data engineering for generative AI and LLMs, Innodata has become a key infrastructure partner to major tech leaders. Strong financials, proprietary platforms and leadership in AI safety position it for substantial future growth.However, despite beating earnings, INOD shares dropped following the earnings release, and this decline followed a pre-earnings surge, highlighting volatility and investor uncertainty over the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects despite broader market strength. Still, over the past one month, INOD shares have rallied 7.1%, outperforming the 6.3% gain recorded by the Zacks Computer - Services market.One-Month Performance of INODBefore making any hasty decision to add this stock to your portfolio or sell, it would be prudent to delve deeper and understand the company, its latest earnings and the concerns to better analyze how to play the stock after its first-quarter earnings release.INOD: Key Takeaways From Q1 EarningsBenefiting from expanding relationships and strong business momentum, Innodata\u2019s revenues grew 120% year over year to $58.3 million in the first quarter of 2025. Adjusted EBITDA increased 236% to $12.7 million, or 22% of revenues \u2014 highlighting scalable operating leverage. The company\u2019s adjusted gross margin of 43% also exceeded its long-term target of 40% \u2014 demonstrating scalable and profitable execution as it ramps up delivery to both new and existing customers.INOD is expanding relationships with key customers, including a second master statement of work with its largest client, tapping a separate, significantly larger budget. The company also secured approximately $8 million in new engagements from four of its other Big Tech customers. Furthermore, INOD is in active discussions with five of its other Big Tech clients, potentially resulting in more than $30 million in near-term awards. Formerly small accounts (such as approximately $200k-$400k in 2024) are showing material expansion opportunities into multi-million-dollar bookings.INOD is onboarding several major clients, including top global firms in enterprise tech, cloud software, digital commerce and healthcare technology \u2014 each with significant growth potential. New customer acquisitions are expected to provide meaningful upside to both the top and bottom lines.With $56.6 million in cash, no debt drawn from its $30 million credit facility and a clean balance sheet with no external debt borrowings, Innodata is well-positioned to reinvest in AI platform development, strategic hiring and customer onboarding. This financial flexibility supports its aggressive go-to-market strategy while maintaining healthy margins.Innodata reiterated its full-year revenue growth target of 40% or more. INOD plans to reinvest operational cash in 2025 toward technology and strategic hires in sales and solutioning to support AI growth. Despite these investments, the company still expects to grow adjusted EBITDA compared to 2024.Headwinds to Consider Before Choosing INOD StockDespite traction with new accounts, Innodata remains heavily dependent on a single large customer, which generated a $135 million annualized run rate in 2024. Though the company has expanded other Big Tech relationships, this dependency remains a key operational risk if contract renewals slow or strategic priorities shift.Moreover, management\u2019s plan to invest in the second quarter to support new programs before revenue realization may weigh on near-term margins. While positioned as strategic, these outlays increase risk if new projects are delayed or underperform expectations.INOD\u2019s Estimates Going SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is pegged at $241.65 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 41.76%. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at 72 cents per share. However, earnings estimates have moved south by 2.7% over the past week, indicating analysts\u2019 bearish sentiments about the stock. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.)Magnitude - Consensus Estimate TrendINOD\u2019s Valuation Looks StretchedInnodata's current valuation seems stretched, as evidenced by its one-year forward price-to-sales ratio of 4.31 \u2014 well above the Zacks Computer \u2013 Services industry average of 1.76. This substantial premium implies that investors may have already factored in a significant portion of the company\u2019s anticipated growth.P/S F12M RatioHere\u2019s How to Play INOD Shares NowInnodata offers a solid mix of financial momentum, strategic positioning and early leadership in a fast-expanding sector. It is positioning itself as a foundational infrastructure partner, earning trust from major tech leaders like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, among others. The tech leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, are expected to collectively invest billions in AI infrastructure throughout 2025, creating a significant opportunity for Innodata.\u00a0With core strengths in large language model data engineering, fine-tuning, and AI safety evaluations, Innodata is well aligned to benefit. While long-term prospects look strong amid rising AI spending from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, near-term risks tied to customer concentration, execution and margin pressure remain.Given the southward revision of earnings estimates and the current valuation suggesting caution for new entrants, existing shareholders should consider holding, and new investors may wait for further validation of revenue diversification and pipeline conversion before adding to positions.INOD stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The tech stock could break out once it retakes a key technical level.AppLovin is projected to post impressive double-digit earnings and revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 as it expands its reach beyond mobile gaming into media, finance, and more.Is this AI-Powered Software Company the Next Tech Giant?AppLovin\u2019s diverse product lineup provides essential tools for clients striving to thrive in the increasingly competitive digital app economy.The Palo Alto-based firm's AI-powered software solutions help its clients reach their target users \u201cin-app, on mobile devices, across streaming TV, and beyond\u201d to try to help them tap into a portion of \u201c1.4 billion daily active users.\u201dAppLovin\u2019s technology helps its clients in mobile gaming and beyond boost user acquisition, enhance engagement, and maximize customer value throughout the customer lifecycle. The firm\u2019s solutions were originally tailored toward mobile app developers in the gaming realm.AppLovin has transformed its business to expand far beyond gaming into finance, fitness, health, shopping, sports betting, and nearly any industry that might be attempting to monetize digital apps. The goal is to become a one-stop ad platform for all direct-to-consumer businesses in the digital economy.AppLovin almost doubled its sales (+93%) in 2021. Following that standout year, growth slowed to 1% in 2022 as the digital ad market slumped, dragging down Meta and others.APP launched its advanced machine learning and AI-driven AXON technology in the second quarter of 2023. That year, AppLovin grew its revenue by 17% and swung from a loss of -$0.52 to a profit of +$0.98 per share. The company followed up with 43% sales growth in 2024 and 362% EPS growth.The Ad Tech Company\u2019s Growth Outlook and Profit FocusThe app monetization company is concentrating on five key growth pillars in 2025. One of APP\u2019s goals is to personalize ad experiences with AI to create \u201ccountless iterations and dynamically select personalized creatives for each user\u201d to help boost engagement and response rates.Personalized ads represent the next frontier in the ad industry, shifting from the current \u201cstatic\u201d experience, where \u201cusers see similar-looking advertisements created by humans,\u201d to a more dynamic, tailored approach.AppLovin is also critically focused on streamlining its operations to improve efficiency and the bottom line. CEO Adam Foroughi said the firm aims to reduce headcount while seizing growth opportunities.Underpinning these efforts is a focus on AI-driven automation and personalization. APP grew its Q1 revenue by 40% and its adjusted earnings by 150%, topping our estimate by 15%. The company\u2019s strong guidance, which came in the face of short-seller reports, pushed its EPS estimates even higher.APP\u2019s Q2 earnings estimate has jumped 29% in the last few months, with its 2026 estimate 26% higher, helping it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company\u2019s EPS outlook has gone straight up over the last year and a half.APP is projected to grow its revenue by 23% in 2025 and 21% in 2026 to surge from $4.71 billion in FY24 to $7 billion in FY26.Meanwhile, it is projected to grow its earnings by 85% and 42%, respectively, following 362% bottom-line expansion in 2024. This trajectory would lift AppLovin\u2019s EPS from $4.53 last year to $11.91 in FY26.APP Short Seller UpdateAppLovin faced significant scrutiny from multiple short-seller reports that challenged the integrity of its AI-powered advertising platform and business practices. Fuzzy Panda Research and others released short seller reports between February and March.Overall, the short sellers claimed that AppLovin\u2019s revenue is low-quality and driven by deceptive, predatory, and other potentially illegal advertising practices.APP has fought against all the allegations and is \u201cfully committed to defending the Company, its operations, and its reputation from those seeking to manipulate the market through false narratives.\u201dIt hired a legal team at the end of March, retaining \u201cAlex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, a nationally recognized legal firm with deep expertise in securities and corporate investigations, to conduct an independent review and investigation into recent short report activity.\u201dAppLovin announced on May 7, when it reported earnings, that it sold its mobile gaming segment to Tripledot Studios for $400 million plus a 20% stake in Tripledot. The deal helps APP focus on its higher-margin ad tech platform and streamline operations amid short-seller scrutiny and strategic reprioritization.Investors must ask themselves a simple question: if Wall Street thought these allegations had legs, why is the stock in the green in 2025 and up over 450% since it went public?AppLovin: Buy This Growth Tech Stock Now, or Wait?AppLovin stock skyrocketed 1,500% over the past two years after a steep drop in 2022 alongside the broader market. APP\u2019s two-year surge blows away Nvidia\u2019s 360% and Meta\u2019s 170%. The stock has climbed 460% since its April 2021 IPO against Tech\u2019s 40% and Meta\u2019s 100%.APP is up 12% in 2025 after its recent rally. Yet, the stock trades 30% below its all-time highs and 20% below its average Zacks price target.If APP breaks above the trendline highlighted above (its December highs, Q4 earnings gap up, and pre-selloff levels), it could skyrocket to new records.That said, AppLovin is overheated on the RSI level front, and it might fall to its 50-day or 200-day moving averages if selling pressure takes over following the huge market rally. Any pullback to those levels could mark a great buying opportunity for investors and traders.Valuation-wise, AppLovin stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs and 50% below its recent highs at 41.8X forward 12-month earnings (Tech trades at 25.5X). If you factor in AppLovin\u2019s huge earnings growth outlook, it trades much closer to the Tech sector\u2019s 1.7 Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 2.1.Bear of the Day:Boise Cascade is one of the top North American producers of engineered wood products and plywood. BCC stock has tanked over 20% in 2025, driven by macroeconomic challenges, industry-specific headwinds, and operational pressures.The engineered wood products powerhouse missed our Q1 2025 earnings estimate by 22% on May 5. It also offered disappointing guidance as part of Boise Cascade\u2019s extended trend of downward EPS revisions.What\u2019s Going On with BCC Stock?Boise Cascade is a leading producer of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood. The company is also a huge player in the wholesale distribution of building products in the U.S.BCC posted an impressive stretch of top-line expansion between 2012 and 2022, highlighted by 18% growth in 2020 and 45% in 2021, driven by the Covid-driven housing and home improvement boom. Boise Cascade followed that up with another 6% sales growth in 2022, before tumbling against a tough to compete against stretch and a slowing housing market.The company\u2019s sales fell 19% in 2023 and 2% in 2024, while its earnings tanked roughly 40% and 20%, respectively.Most recently, Boise Cascade adjusted earnings dropped 59% YoY in the first quarter to $1.06 a share, missing our estimate by 22%. CEO Nate Jorgensen pointed to \u201cconstrained demand, difficult weather, and planned downtime at our Oakdale veneer and plywood mill\u201d as part of its rough quarter and downbeat outlook.Boise Cascade's consensus 2025 earnings estimate has dropped 18% since its Q1 report. Its 2026 estimate has slipped 13% since then, and its overall negative earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The company\u2019s earnings are projected to fall another 31% YoY in 2025 on 2% lower sales.Stay Away from Boise Cascade Stock for Now?Boise Cascade is prepared to benefit from long-term demographic trends and the ongoing undersupply of single-family homes that have kept housing demand high. The company also pays dividends and has a sturdy balance sheet.Investors might want to put Boise Cascade on their watchlists since it could be a longer-term winner. Unfortunately, BCC faces near-term headwinds driven by weak housing market demand, economic uncertainty, and more.Additional content:AppLovin Stock Plunges -26% in 3 Months: Is It a Buy Now?AppLovin Corp. has witnessed its stock decline 26% over the past three months, worse than the industry\u2019s 15% decline. Notably, competitors in the in-game mobile advertising space have also faced headwinds. Alphabet shares have dropped 11%, while Meta Platforms has seen a 10% decrease during the same period, reflecting broader weakness in the digital ad ecosystem.However, the tide appears to be turning. APP has surged 64% in the past month, signaling a strong rebound. Alphabet has also shown signs of recovery with an 8% gain, while Meta Platforms has rallied 31% during the same timeframe.As major players like Alphabet and Meta Platforms regain momentum, their performance may signal improving market conditions for digital ad companies. This analysis will explore whether APP now presents an attractive opportunity for investors.APP\u2019s Strategic Shift Toward a High-Margin Business ModelAppLovin is actively transforming into a pure-play advertising platform, sharpening its focus on high-growth, high-margin segments. A major milestone in this transition was the $900 million sale of its gaming unit to Tripledot Studios. This divestiture allows APP to concentrate on its ad technology, a move that aligns with its vision of serving the global digital advertising market, which includes over 10 million businesses. To capitalize on this vast market, the company is investing in automation, developing advanced tools to enhance customer efficiency and maximize ad performance.Strong Financial Performance Underscores Growth PotentialAppLovin\u2019s latest earnings report reinforces its strong financial health and growth trajectory. The company continues to benefit from its AXON 2.0 technology and strategic expansion within the gaming and in-app advertising sectors. In the first quarter of 2025, revenues surged 40% year over year, reflecting strong market demand.Adjusted EBITDA jumped 83% year over year, showcasing improved operational efficiency. Net income skyrocketed 144% from the prior year, demonstrating APP\u2019s ability to translate revenue growth into significant profitability. For the full year 2024, revenues climbed 43% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA surged 81%, underscoring AppLovin\u2019s ability to seize market opportunities while maintaining efficiency.Analysts Project APP\u2019s Robust Earnings and Revenue ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 earnings is $2.01 per share, indicating an impressive 125.8% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 85.2% and 41.9%, respectively, compared to the previous years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is $1.45 billion, representing an impressive 33.9% increase from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, earnings for the full years 2025 and 2026 are expected to grow by 24.3% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the previous years.APP Is a BuyAPP presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its impressive financial performance and robust growth prospects. The company's recent results and strategic initiatives underscore its potential for continued success in the gaming and software sectors. AppLovin\u2019s strong fundamentals, innovative technology and strategic growth initiatives position it as a leader in its industry. With a solid financial outlook and increasing analyst confidence, we recommend a \"Buy\" rating for APP stock to capitalize on its promising growth trajectory.APP currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

They will be launched on the Android XR platform, an operating system for headsets and glasses, Google's Vice President of XR Shahram Izadi said.The news boosted shares of Warby Parker, which closed up 16% at $20.34 on Tuesday.Later Tuesday, Kering Eyewear, which develops eyewear under brands including Gucci, Cartier and Saint Laurent, also said it has partnered with Google to develop AI glasses. The Milan-based company said the glasses will also use Google's Android XR and aim to integrate into everyday life with personalized AI-driven features.Kering Eyewear didn't disclose the terms of the partnership.The companies enter what is becoming a crowded market for smart glasses.Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica and Facebook owner Meta have developed smart glasses that include voice-activated Meta AI, with recent features including real-time speech translation and reminder notifications. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said recently that demand has accelerated, with sales tripling over the past year.Snap and Amazon have also launched smart glasses.Google previously sold smart glasses called Google Glass, but the project was shuttered in part due to privacy concerns.Write to Kelly Cloonan at kelly.cloonan@wsj.com",

The stock is down nearly 13% year-to-date , though it has rebounded over 9% in the past week , trimming earlier losses.A key blow came on May 7, when Apple\u2019s SVP of services, Eddy Cue, confirmed that the company is exploring AI-powered alternatives to Google Search in its Safari browser. That\u2019s no small matter for Alphabet, which pays Apple an estimated $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine, a relationship that supports roughly 36% of Google\u2019s mobile search ad revenue .Adding to the uncertainty, Alphabet faces rising pressure from AI-based competitors like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Elon Musk\u2019s Grok , which are starting to encroach on traditional search . However, the company has been proactive in adapting to the changing landscape.Alphabet\u2019s Gemini, its flagship large language model, has become central to its AI strategy. According to management's recent earnings call , AI Overviews, its integration of generative AI into Google Search, now reaches over 1.5 billion users across 140 countries and is monetized comparably to traditional results.Meanwhile, the company's other revenue streams continue to show strength . YouTube ad revenue surged to $10.47 billion last quarter, driven by growing subscriptions and user engagement . Once a laggard compared to peers like Amazon AWS , Google Cloud is gaining traction with enterprise adoption of its AI-powered solutions.Even Waymo , Alphabet\u2019s autonomous driving unit, is expanding operations across more than 10 U.S. cities , pointing to long-term optionality beyond search and ads.Analysts See Value in Alphabet\u2019s Valuation [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:GOOGL] While macro and competitive pressures have weighed on the stock, Alphabet\u2019s fundamentals remain strong , and analysts are paying attention.One of the most compelling aspects of GOOGL at current levels is its valuation.\u00a0Historically, the stock has traded at an\u00a0 average P/E of 28 over the past decade. Today, its forward P/E is just 16.25 , and its trailing P/E sits at 18.4 , levels typically reserved for more mature, slower-growth companies.This discount is drawing analyst interest. According to data from 40 analysts covering the stock , the average price target for GOOGL is $199.75 , representing 21% upside from current levels.The stock also holds a\u00a0 consensus rating of Moderate Buy , with 30 analysts issuing outright Buy recommendations , reflecting continued bullishness from Wall Street despite recent turbulence.Institutions Are Still Accumulating GOOGLPerhaps even more telling than analyst sentiment is the behavior of institutional investors . Despite the stock\u2019s drawdown and underperformance compared to some of its Magnificent Seven peers, institutions have not been dumping Alphabet shares.

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google and artificial-intelligence startup Character.AI must face a lawsuit from a Florida woman who said Character.AI's chatbots caused her 14-year-old son's suicide, a judge ruled on Wednesday.U.S. District Judge Anne Conway said the companies failed to show at an early stage of the case that the free-speech protections of the U.S. Constitution barred Megan Garcia's lawsuit.The lawsuit is one of the first in the U.S. against an AI company for allegedly failing to protect children from psychological harms. It alleges that the teenager killed himself after becoming obsessed with an AI-powered chatbot.A Character.AI spokesperson said the company will continue to fight the case and employs safety features on its platform to protect minors, including measures to prevent \"conversations about self-harm.\" Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the company strongly disagrees with the decision. Castaneda also said that Google and Character.AI are \"entirely separate\" and that Google \"did not create, design, or manage Character.AI's app or any component part of it.\"Garcia's attorney, Meetali Jain, said the \"historic\" decision \"sets a new precedent for legal accountability across the AI and tech ecosystem.\"Character.AI was founded by two former Google engineers whom Google later rehired as part of a deal granting it a license to the startup's technology. Garcia argued that Google was a co-creator of the technology.Garcia sued both companies in October after the death of her son, Sewell Setzer, in February 2024. The lawsuit said Character.AI programmed its chatbots to represent themselves as \"a real person, a licensed psychotherapist, and an adult lover, ultimately resulting in Sewell's desire to no longer live outside\" of its world.According to the complaint, Setzer took his life moments after telling a Character.AI chatbot imitating \"Game of Thrones\" character Daenerys Targaryen that he would \"come home right now.\"Character.AI and Google asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit on multiple grounds, including that the chatbots' output was constitutionally protected free speech.Conway said on Wednesday that Character.AI and Google \"fail to articulate why words strung together by an LLM (large language model) are speech.\"The judge also rejected Google's request to find that it could not be liable for aiding Character.AI's alleged misconduct.",

    "descriptionText": "By Joe Woelfel and Connor SmithStocks marked their worst day in a month after Treasury yields spiked in the wake of a weak auction of 20-year bonds.These stocks made moves Wednesday:Wolfspeed sank 59% to $1.28 after The Wall Street Journal reported the chip-component maker was getting ready to file for bankruptcy in the next few weeks amid struggles with its debt levels. The Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, said Wolfspeed was aiming to work out a Chapter 11 plan that has support of a majority of its creditors.Tesla fell 2.7%. CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday indicated he was committed to the electric-vehicle company. The chief executive told a conference in Qatar that he expects to be CEO in five years, and also said he would step back from political spending. Musk also told CNBC in an interview that Tesla was on track for a June launch of robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, adding the rollout would be slow.Nvidia was down 1.9%. CEO Jensen Huang again slammed U.S. curbs on the chip maker's exports to China. Huang said Wednesday at a news conference in Taiwan that U.S. measures designed to stop China from getting its hands on Nvidia's artificial-intelligence chips had been \"a failure,\" according to reports.Target fell 5.2% as the retailer's first-quarter adjusted earnings missed analysts' estimates and revenue fell 2.8% year over year to $23.8 billion for the quarter ended May 3. For the fiscal year ending in January, the company expects a low-single digit decline in sales. Past guidance called for sales to grow around 1% for the year.UnitedHealth declined 5.7% to $302.92. Shares of the health insurance giant were downgraded to Reduce from Hold by analysts at HSBC and the price target was cut to $270 from $490. The stock declined sharply last week after UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty resigned and the company suspended its 2025 outlook. The Wall Street Journal also reported the company was being investigated by the Justice Department for possible criminal Medicare fraud.Alphabet was up 2.8%. The company's Google unit, at its developers conference Tuesday, issued updates around artificial intelligence and how it plans to solidify its place in search. But many of the AI products announced by Alphabet won't come for a few months. Google's headline announcement was the implementation of artificial intelligence into search in what it is calling \"AI Mode.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said it was a \"total reimagining of search.\"Lowe's fell 1.7% after posting first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' estimates. The company maintained its fiscal-year outlook but CEO Marvin Ellison flagged \"near-term uncertainty and housing market headwinds.\"Fair Isaac, the credit analytics company, dropped 16% after a Trump-appointed official expressed his disappointment with the company's decision to raise wholesale royalty fee for credit scores.VF Corp sank 16% after fiscal fourth-quarter revenue fell from a year earlier and missed analysts' estimates, and the owner of brands Timberland and The North Face said it expects first-quarter revenue to decline between 3% and 5%.Palo Alto Networks reported fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that topped analysts' estimates and raised fiscal 2025 profit expectations. Shares of the cybersecurity company were down 6.8%, however, after Palo Alto Network's revenue outlook for the fourth quarter missed estimates.Take-Two Interactive Software fell 4.5% after the videogame maker proposed an offering for $1 billion common shares.U.S.-listed shares of Baidu fell 4.3%. The Chinese tech company's growing artificial-intelligence business helped it top analysts' first-quarter earnings estimates.XPeng jumped 13% in U.S. trading after its first-quarter loss narrowed and revenue in the period more than doubled to 15.81 billion yuan. The company said it expects to deliver 102,000 to 108,000 vehicles in the second quarter.Earnings reports were expected Wednesday after the closing bell from Snowflake, Zoom Communications, and Urban Outfitters.Write to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The results, while not perfect, show how good AI is getting at processing language and mimicking human emotion.Google announced the speech translator at the company's annual I/O keynote Tuesday, and I got to experience it for myself a few days earlier, live on a video call with two Spanish speakers.It isn't just that the translator turns your words into another language. It emulates your voice and tone, translating with a few seconds of lag. The effect is like watching an overdubbed foreign-language speaker on a news broadcast \u2014 but the voice-over is created by AI in the speaker's same voice.A Google Meet pop-up warned me and the two Spanish-speaking employees, Cami and Jair, that the experimental translation might not always be correct. We clicked to agree, then began to converse with each other in our native languages.They talked about where they like to eat after work and travel for weekend getaways in various Latin American locales.

    "descriptionText": "C3.ai, Inc. AI is currently trading at a slight premium relative to its Zacks Computer & Technology sector but at a discount to historical metrics. In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, AI is trading at 6.39X, higher than the sector\u2019s 6.18X. Its forward 12-month P/S ratio sits below its three-year average, as shown below.C3.ai ValuationIn terms of C3.ai\u2019s share price performance, its shares have gained a notable 20.7% in the past month. However, it has underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, as shown below.At its current price, the AI stock represents a 48.6% discount from its 52-week high of $45.08. It also indicates a 36.1% premium to its 52-week low of $17.03.C3.ai Share Price PerformanceIs a recent uptick in C3.ai\u2019s stock price reason enough to buy in? Before making a decision based solely on momentum, let\u2019s take a closer look at the underlying factors that could help investors determine whether now is the right time to add AI stock to their portfolio.Decoding C3.ai\u2019s TailwindsC3.ai\u2019s partnerships with hyperscalers and industry leaders, such as Amazon \u2019s AMZN AWS, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google Cloud, Microsoft \u2019s MSFT Azure, and Booz Allen Hamilton, serve as key growth multipliers. The company\u2019s integration into Microsoft\u2019s global sales ecosystem and the execution of co-selling motions resulted in 28 closed deals across nine industries, implying a 460% quarter-over-quarter increase. These alliances shortened sales cycles by nearly 20% and expanded the company\u2019s qualified sales pipeline by 244% year over year, highlighting the effectiveness of its partner-driven go-to-market strategy.C3.ai expanded its customer footprint across both commercial and government sectors. Notable wins included Flex, Sanofi, ExxonMobil, Shell and the U.S. Department of Defense. These clients adopted solutions ranging from predictive maintenance and mission assurance to customer service enhancement using C3 Generative AI. This diversification across industries, from pharma to utilities and defense, demonstrates the flexibility and relevance of C3.ai\u2019s applications across mission-critical environments.C3.ai has built a robust federal pipeline, especially with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), where use cases such as predictive maintenance, logistics optimization and battlefield decision support are gaining traction. The company cited 39 active pilots with the DoD and Intelligence Community during the quarter. This engagement, which includes partnerships with entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Army, positions C3.ai to benefit from increasing federal AI budgets and long procurement cycles that often result in multi-year deals. In April 2025, C3 AI and Arcfield have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the adoption of enterprise-grade AI applications for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Arcfield will utilize the C3 Agentic AI Platform and C3 Generative AI to enhance its mission-critical services, including systems engineering, predictive maintenance and space defense operations.What\u2019s Affecting C3.ai?C3.ai faces significant challenges, including the need to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate competition from both established players and emerging startups. The company reported GAAP a net loss of 62 cents per share in the fiscal third quarter (non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share).A significant challenge for C3.ai is the cost structure associated with its numerous pilot deployments. The company signed 50 new pilots in the fiscal third quarter, bringing the total to 310, of which 245 are active. These pilots, often precursors to larger contracts, carry higher upfront costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. The company anticipates some moderation in gross margins due to an increased mix of more costly pilots. It expects some moderation in operating margins in the near term due to additional investments in the business.C3.ai is actively scaling its operations, particularly through the expansion of its direct salesforce and strategic partner ecosystem, which includes Microsoft, AWS and McKinsey's QuantumBlack. While this investment is central to long-term growth, it also introduces near-term pressure on operating margins. The company plans to continue investing in sales, customer support and R&D through fiscal 2025. This is expected to keep operating losses elevated and push the company into negative free cash flow territory for the full year, though a positive free cash flow is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.C3.ai\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 loss per share has remained unchanged at $2.29 (versus a loss of $2.34 a year ago) in the past 30 days. However, the consensus mark for fiscal 2026 loss per share has widened to $2.41 in the same time frame.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 sales implies growth of 29.6% and 22.4%, respectively.Wrapping UpDespite C3.ai\u2019s high-profile partnerships and a strong pipeline of pilot programs, its persistent lack of profitability, margin pressures, and an increasingly expensive cost structure raise concerns. While recent momentum has lifted the stock price by more than 20% in the past month, this rally masks deeper operational concerns. The company continues to operate at a steep GAAP loss, with more than 300 active pilots that are yet to convert into meaningful, margin-accretive revenues.

    "descriptionText": "IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company\u2019s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq\u2019s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella\u2019s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ\u2019s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\u00a0Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ\u2019s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ\u2019s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors.\u00a0Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ\u2019s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company\u2019s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ\u2019s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption.
