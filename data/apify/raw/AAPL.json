Yet the IT sector has a two-year sales CAGR more than double Apple's, at 11.3%.Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, says Apple's bigger problem is that Siri's integration with Apple Intelligence has fallen behand. The company is at risk of losing market share to any contender able to release life-changing generative AI services. That's something Mortonson believes could happen through Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pixel phones or through Google's partnership with Samsung Galaxy and the integration of generative AI into that smartphone.That risk means he wouldn't suggest investors be overweight the stock, and he believes a stock like Alphabet is a better bet given its cheaper forward P/E at 17.3 with a two-year estimated sales CAGR double Apple's, at 10.7%.The next important event for Apple will be its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 9. The company will have a chance to wow customers with any updates, particularly on Apple Intelligence. But until then, Luria believes, he said, that investors should suspend judgment about the stock.Overall, investing is based on an individual's risk tolerance. While Apple is still seen as a solid company, and a good stock to own, there may be better risk-reward opportunities elsewhere. As for investors who already own the stock because they like the company and believe in the business's long-term prospects, panic selling based on negative headlines is never a good strategy. Instead, investors should focus on the company's key drivers. And a big one right now is how well Apple can compete in generative AI services because that will help drive hardware sales and increase demand for Apple's services segment, including cloud storage.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By Rolfe WinklerFor Tim Cook, the hits keep coming.On Friday, President Trump targeted Apple with new demands that the company make iPhones in the U.S., threatening 25% tariffs if the company doesn't comply. \"Rise and shine Tim Cook,\" Trump whisperer Laura Loomer posted on X, reminding the Apple CEO he is at the center of the president's trade bull's-eye.That is just one of the threats Cook has confronted in what has appeared to be a no good, very bad year for Apple. Aside from Trump, Cook is facing off against two U.S. judges, European and worldwide regulators, state and federal lawmakers, and even a creator of the iPhone, to say nothing of the cast of rivals outrunning Apple in artificial intelligence.Each is a threat to Apple's hefty profit margins, long the company's trademark and the reason investors drove its valuation above $3 trillion before any other company. Shareholders are still Cook's most important constituency. The stock's 25% fall from its peak shows their concern about whether he \u2014 or anyone \u2014 can navigate the choppy 2025 waters.What can be said for Apple is that the company is patient, and that has often paid off in the past.This past week, a key architect of the iPhone, Jony Ive, joined OpenAI to develop a next-generation device that weans consumers off screens. After he announced a deal to sell his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported that a key goal is to deliver an AI-powered device that shifts the current computing paradigm in which humans stare at black rectangles all day. Later, OpenAI told employees it is aiming to make 100 million AI \"companion\" devices.It is hard to gauge the potential for a brand-new computing device from a company that has never made one. Yet the fact that it is coming from the man who led design of the iPhone and other hit Apple products means it can't be dismissed. Apple sees the threat coming: \"You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as that sounds,\" an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified in a court case this month.Apple isn't expected to show any AI breakthroughs at its annual developer conference in a couple of weeks.

    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit.

            "Markets: On Monday, markets digested Moody's U.S. debt downgrade and the passage through a House committee of Republicans' tax and budget bill.

The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let\u2019s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company\u2019s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia\u2019s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion.\u00a0Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago.

    "descriptionText": "US benchmark equity indexes declined on Friday as President Donald Trump's tariff threats against the European Union and Apple NASDAQ:AAPL refueled concerns about a trade war. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1% at 18,737.2. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% to 5,802.8, marking the fourth straight day of declines, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6% to 41,603.1. Among sectors, technology saw the biggest drop, while utilities paced the gainers. The three benchmarks are down more than 2% each this week. US markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Trump recommended a 50% tariff rate on the EU, effective June 1, saying that talks with the bloc had stalled. The announcement has \"reignited\" concerns about a transatlantic trade war, ING Bank said. Separately, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares declined 3%. Producing iPhones in the US is not \"feasible\" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a client note, calling the idea a \"fairy tale.\"\"Today's announced threat may be a goad to European leaders to negotiate more quickly with the US,\" Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report. \"In any case, the news reiterates our cautious guidance of recent weeks, namely, that new tariffs (and, as today, threats of tariffs) remain material risks to financial markets, especially when the announcements come as surprises.\"US Treasury yields were lower, with the 10-year rate decreasing 4.4 basis points to 4.51% and the two-year rate losing nearly one basis point to 3.99%. Deckers Outdoor NYSE:DECK shares sank 20%, the worst performer on the S&P 500. The footwear and apparel company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Thursday. Despite being strong, the results were overshadowed by sales growth deceleration at its Hoka sneaker brand and potential demand weakness from price increases, KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a client note. KeyBanc lowered its rating on Deckers' stock to sector weight from overweight. Workday NASDAQ:WDAY shares slumped nearly 13% on Friday, the second biggest drop on the S&P 500. The cloud human resources company late Thursday logged better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and issued a subscription revenue outlook for the ongoing three-month period that matched Wall Street's estimates. Intuit NASDAQ:INTU was the best performer on the S&P 500, up 8.1%. The financial technology platform late Thursday posted fiscal third-quarter results that exceeded the Street's estimates. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was up 0.7% at $61.63 a barrel. For the week, WTI crude futures were expected to report a modest decline.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the last earnings call that more iPhones sold in the U.S. will be made in India as Apple continues to geographically diversify its manufacturing footprint.\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, \" Trump wrote in a post on social-media platform Truth Social.\"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,\" the president added.In early trading Friday, Apple shares fell by 2.6% to $196.17.Trump has been resolute about the topic. Last month, when asked by a reporter if Trump wants iPhones to be made domestically, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: \"Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.\"Wall Street analysts, however, generally believe domestic iPhone manufacturing isn't tenable on a financial basis. The company relies on the contract manufacturer Foxconn to make the vast majority of its iPhones in China. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimates an iPhone made in the U.S. would be sold at $3,500 versus $1,000 today.\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhone in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" Ives wrote on Friday, adding such a move to shift production would take five to 10 years.In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. Jobs bluntly replied: \"Those jobs aren't coming back,\" citing how only Asia has the supply chain ecosystem, from screws to rubber gaskets, along with thousands of specialized manufacturing engineers needed to make smartphones.If Trump doesn't back down, Apple faces several options to revamp its product strategy to mitigate the impact from tariffs.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has suggested Apple can remove the less-profitable, low-end storage models from its iPhone lineup. A \"targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,\" Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has said Apple can move new launches to a two-year schedule from annually. That would to help simplify the supply chain by extending the timeline on expensive manufacturing changes.Of course, Apple can decide to fight Trump and pressure him to revoke an iPhone tariff. The company could threaten to add a \"tariff surcharge\" to every sales receipt, so consumers know Trump's policies are responsible for the higher prices.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "Friday, May 23, 2025Pre-market futures are down precipitously this morning as President Trump amps up the rhetoric on his global trade war. While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around.\u00a0Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas \u2014 whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed \u2014 unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company. Thus, the -3.5% drop in AAPL stock this morning adds to its -19% loss year to date.Not content with going on the offensive against one of America\u2019s most successful companies, the president also turns his attention to the European Union (EU), on which he now proposes a +50% tariff on imports from Europe. The EU is a bigger trading partner with the U.S., with currently a $160 billion trade surplus. This is now being challenged.All of this, of course, comes ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S.: Memorial Day is this Monday, when markets will be closed. A week from today, we\u2019ll see a big Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report \u2014 the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge on monthly inflation. Also next week will bring us quarterly earnings from NVIDIA NVDA, the most successful chipmaker on the planet. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)After today\u2019s opening bell, New Home Sales for April are expected to wane back below +700K (+724K in March, to be specific) to +695K. A month ago, new home sales were seeing the most business in the South, while the Northeast fell back by -22%. In April, 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaged +6.88%.We wish you all a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend, where we keep in mind those who sacrificed their lives and livelihoods on behalf of defending our nation. See you next week.Questions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here>>This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

    "descriptionText": "NEW YORK CITY, NY / ACCESS Newswire / May 23, 2025 / Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC is investigating potential claims on behalf of purchasers of Apple Inc. (\"Apple\" or \"the Company\") NASDAQ:AAPL . Investors who purchased Apple securities are encouraged to obtain additional information and assist the investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.Investigation DetailsOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced that it was indefinitely delaying promised updates to its Siri digital assistant. Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025.What's Next?If you are aware of any facts relating to this investigation or purchased Apple securities, you can assist this investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.

    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says.

Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The \"real,\" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age \u2014 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later \u2014 and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. \"The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,\" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",

    "descriptionText": "Apple\u2019s decision to expand its manufacturing footprint in India has triggered a sharp response from US President Donald Trump, who warned on Friday that iPhones sold in the United States must be made domestically\u2014or face heavy tariffs. The warning marks a new escalation in Trump\u2019s global tariff strategy, directly targeting one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.\u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cIf that is not the case, a tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.\u201dThe move marks Trump\u2019s first direct trade threat against a single company, setting a precedent for potential future action against other multinationals who rely heavily on overseas production.Apple shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading after the post, dragging down broader market sentiment.Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped by 112 points, or 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures both declined by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Source: Truth SocialTrump\u2019s warning follows report about Foxconn\u2019s $1.5bn plant in IndiaThe president\u2019s statement comes on the heels of reports about Apple\u2019s key supplier, Foxconn\u2019s plans to invest $1.5 billion in a new component plant near Chennai, India, further entrenching the country\u2019s position in Apple\u2019s global supply chain. According to a Financial Times report, the plant will assemble iPhone display modules, which play a vital role in the touchscreen interface and visual quality of the device.Two Indian government officials told FT that the facility, located in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Oragadam industrial region, has already received clearance from local authorities. It is expected to create around 14,000 jobs and become one of the largest electronics-sector investments in the country.Foxconn disclosed the investment via a filing on the London Stock Exchange this week, noting that the funds will be routed through its Indian subsidiary, Yuzhan Technology India.Currently, Apple manufactures around 85% of its iPhones in China, with India accounting for roughly 15%. The company has been slowly increasing its Indian production share, partly to diversify its supply chain away from China amid rising geopolitical risks and to leverage India\u2019s more favourable trade ties with the United States.Escalation of frustrationTrump\u2019s threat follows a more measured statement he made last week on the same issueAt an event in Qatar last week, Trump revealed that he had directly confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company\u2019s growing operations in India, despite its pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States.\u201cI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI told him: \u2018Tim, you\u2019re my friend. You\u2019re coming here with $500 billion, but now you\u2019re building all over India. I don\u2019t want you building in India.\u201dHe accused Apple of taking advantage of preferential treatment in the US while concentrating its manufacturing overseas, especially in China. \u201cWe\u2019ve treated you really good,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you got to build for us.\u201dThe high costs of Apple\u2019s US manufacturingDespite political pressure, shifting iPhone assembly to the United States remains economically challenging. Industry analysts estimate that relocating production would cause labour costs to skyrocket\u2014from $290 per month per worker in India to about $2,900 under US wage laws. This would increase the cost of assembling each device from around $30 to $390.Such a move could slash Apple\u2019s profit per iPhone from $450 to just $60 unless the company raises its prices.

However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",
    "shortDescription": "With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA\u00a0less than a week away, the chip giant\u2019s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily i\u2026",

    "descriptionText": "By Gavin Bade, Meridith McGraw and Rolfe WinklerWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump fired new salvos in the global trade war on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on imported goods from the European Union and new duties on iPhones and other smartphones made overseas.Trump said the EU had been \"very difficult to deal with\" on trade in a Friday morning social-media post. Less than a half hour earlier, he threatened Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, with a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones made overseas.\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,\" the president wrote.Later on Friday, in Oval Office comments, Trump said those tariffs will include \"Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair.\" Trump appeared to be referring to companies that manufacture smartphones outside of the U.S. He added that the tariffs would likely be imposed in late June.The threats build on the president's effort to pressure CEOs to move more manufacturing to America and punish allies whose trade policies the White House argues are unfair. Cook met with Trump at the White House this week, according to a White House official.The White House didn't immediately provide additional comment. Apple declined to comment. An EU representative declined to comment. Apple shares declined 3% on Friday.Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU imports, which was later paused for 90 days to allow for negotiations. A 10% baseline levy remains, and some specific EU products, like cars, are subject to higher tariff rates.The U.S. president has long criticized European nations on trade, and he said in his Friday morning social-media post that trade discussions with the bloc had made little progress. \"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" he wrote. He said the 50% tariff would go into effect on June. 1.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he is \"not looking for a deal.\" Minutes later, he said the EU likely wants an agreement to avoid the tariffs, and added, \"We're going to see what happens, but right now it's going on on June 1.\" Trump listed Europe's nontariff barriers, regulations and lawsuits against U.S. firms as prime irritants driving his threat.European officials had expressed cautious optimism in recent days that talks were progressing after the two sides exchanged documents outlining some of the trade issues they are seeking to discuss. However, they acknowledged they remain far apart in their positions.The EU has been unwilling to move on some of Trump's demands, particularly the value-added tax, which the administration views as an unfair trade practice, but EU Economy Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said the tax is off the table in negotiations. This week, Dombrovskis needled the Trump team at a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting by saying their trade deals would be a \"suboptimal\" outcome for the global economy and suggesting that U.S. allies had to compromise with the U.S. on trade language in a joint statement.EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 ef\u010dovi\u010d spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, hours after Trump's initial threat.

    "descriptionText": "Al Root and George GloverTesla has had a tumultuous few days of trading, ending its four-week winning streak.Tesla stock dropped 0.5% on Friday to $339.34, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively.Shares ended the week down 3%. Tesla stock had had a four-week winning streak going, but this week didn't have the kind of news that could lift the stock further. The House passed President Donald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which included provisions to end the EV purchase tax credit and charge EV owners a small annual fee for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate also voted to take away California's right to regulate its air quality. If California loses that right, it jeopardizes hundreds of millions of dollars Tesla earns by selling zero-emission vehicle tax credits.GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson was surprised Tesla stock closed higher on Thursday after the Senate vote, calling it \"deeply negative for Tesla's fundamentals,\" in an email. Californian officials, however, said they will fight in court to keep state regulations in effect.There was some good news this week, too. CEO Elon Musk sat down with CNBC's David Faber and reiterated plans to launch a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Investors have high hopes for the robotaxi business, but the rollout will go slow, according to Musk, and humans will be overseeing vehicle operations.That warning didn't stop Wedbush analyst Dan Ives from trumpeting the robotaxi launch. He said in a research note published Friday that AI and autonomous driving should be worth at least $1 trillion for the electric car maker, adding that the Trump administration could help Tesla to avoid \"the federal regulatory spiderweb.\"\"The march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose,\" Ives wrote, maintaining his Outperform rating and raising his price target to $500 from $350. That implies the stock could jump about 47% from its level as of Thursday's close.Human intervention will make it difficult for Tesla to show investors it has fully solved autonomous driving, says Future Fund Active ETF cofounder Gary Black, adding that could prove disappointing.Tesla investors, it appears, will deal with that after the robotaxi service launches.But right now they have to deal with the return of Tariff Man. Friday morning, Trump said on Truth Social that he would put 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones and 50% tariffs on Europe. The announcement sent Tesla stock from a premarket gain to a loss.If there's one thing Tesla investors can't push back against, it's a risk-off market.Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By Ben RoseAbout the author: Ben Rose is president of Battle Road Research, an independent equity-research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook's response to President Donald Trump's made-in-America push calls to mind a scene in the movie My Cousin Vinny. Vincent Gambini (played by Joe Pesci), a novice defense attorney, is scolded by Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) for showing up in his Alabama courtroom without a suit and tie, with the judge taking particular offense to Gambini's long leather jacket. When Gambini returns to the courtroom for his next appearance he is dressed the same way, but this time the judge holds in him contempt of court. Gambini, in disbelief, says to the judge: \"You were serious about that?\"While Apple was entirely \u2014 some might say miraculously \u2014 spared from tariffs during Trump's first term, the president has vowed that now \"no one gets off the hook,\" not even America's most valuable company by market capitalization. And this time, he is serious. Apple will need to move some of its production to the U.S.During the first Trump administration, many U.S. companies that manufactured their products in China faced a 25% tariff. Some companies responded by moving production to other low-labor-cost countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to avoid the tariff penalty. Even though it had received an exemption, Apple, no doubt mindful of the growing tension between Washington and Beijing, began to move a portion of its iPhone production to India, in an effort to diversify its supply chain and manufacturing.At the start of the president's second term, companies were unsure whether the president's goal was to negotiate better trade deals, reduce reliance on China, or move more manufacturing back to the U.S. This time around, Apple wasn't going to take any chances. Just 35 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Apple unveiled plans to invest $500 billion (with a b) in the U.S. over the next four years to construct new manufacturing facilities, AI data centers, create 20,000 new jobs, and establish a manufacturing academy focused on workforce training.Having taken public steps to satisfy the president's wishes, Apple's executives likely breathed a further sigh of relief when U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on April 13 that computers and semiconductors would receive a 90-day reprieve from the president's scorching level of 145% tariffs on goods from China. Apple and others would be subject to a separate set of tariffs to be determined at a future date. Perhaps calculating that Trump's ultimate goal was simply to move manufacturing out of China, Apple announced a significant expansion of its production operations in India, presumably with the view that the president would not mind where its iPhones are made \u2014 so long as they are not made in China.But like Vincent Gambini, Tim Cook is learning the hard way that the president is serious about Apple making its products in the U. S. \u2014 ASAP \u2014 rather than potentially taking its sweet time by further expanding production in India.The pushback from Apple and others is that labor rates in the U.S. will make their products uncompetitive in the U.S., with some suggesting American-manufactured iPhones would cost U.S. consumers as much as $3,500.Apple is at least partially right, since labor costs in China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region are a fraction of what they would be in the U.S. In addition, Apple has invested billions of dollars in China, and has nurtured a reliable supply chain that meets its rigorous quality standards. Moving production to India or the U.S. is likely to result not only in higher costs, but a reduction in product quality.

    "descriptionText": "Tae KimApple is facing difficult choices if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to put a big tariff on iPhones.On Friday, Trump said he would impose tariff of at least 25% on Apple iPhones sold in the U.S. unless the smartphones are made domestically. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the last earnings call that more iPhones sold in the U.S. will be made in India as Apple continues to geographically diversify its manufacturing footprint.\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else, \" Trump wrote in a post on social-media platform Truth Social.\"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,\" the president added.In early trading Friday, Apple shares fell by 2.6% to $196.17.Trump has been resolute about the topic. Last month, when asked by a reporter if Trump wants iPhones to be made domestically, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt replied: \"Absolutely. He believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.\"Wall Street analysts, however, generally believe domestic iPhone manufacturing isn't tenable on a financial basis. The company relies on the contract manufacturer Foxconn to make the vast majority of its iPhones in China. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimates an iPhone made in the U.S. would be sold at $3,500 versus $1,000 today.\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhone in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" Ives wrote on Friday, adding such a move to shift production would take five to 10 years.In 2011, President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. Jobs bluntly replied: \"Those jobs aren't coming back,\" citing how only Asia has the supply chain ecosystem, from screws to rubber gaskets, along with thousands of specialized manufacturing engineers needed to make smartphones.If Trump doesn't back down, Apple faces several options to revamp its product strategy to mitigate the impact from tariffs.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has suggested Apple can remove the less-profitable, low-end storage models from its iPhone lineup. A \"targeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,\" Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan has said Apple can move new launches to a two-year schedule from annually. That would to help simplify the supply chain by extending the timeline on expensive manufacturing changes.Of course, Apple can decide to fight Trump and pressure him to revoke an iPhone tariff. The company could threaten to add a \"tariff surcharge\" to every sales receipt, so consumers know Trump's policies are responsible for the higher prices.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back \u2014 and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. \"The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,\" Ive said in the merger announcement video.\"Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'\" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. \"Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.\"The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An \"AI device\" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, \"you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.\"So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it \"The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now.\" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying \"We look forward to sharing our work next year.\"Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

On Thursday, Apple shares were down 0.13%, and the stock is down 17% in the year so far.Losing easy moneyCramer points out that the first big problem for Apple is losing $20 billion from Google due to the antitrust case against Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.\u00a0Alphabet reportedly pays Apple $20 billion annually to make sure Google is the default search engine on iPhone and iPad.\u00a0In the US antitrust case against Google for its monopoly in the search engine market.While Cramer said Apple could make the money by other methods, like charging other search platforms, the \u201cAlphabet deal was $1 a share in easy profits that could go away\u201d, he said.Legal strugglesApple\u2019s legal case with Fortnite maker Epic Games is another area of concern for Cramer.\u00a0Apple\u2019s battle with Epic Games over app store payments could cause another 30-cent departure in the company\u2019s earnings per share, Cramer noted.\u00a0Recently, a federal judge slammed Apple over non-compliance with opening up its app store to alternative payment methods.\u00a0The judge had ruled that the Cupertino-based company stop charging commissions on payments made outside Apple\u2019s payment system.\u00a0Apple charges a 30% commission on payments made on its App Store.The Fortnite game is now available on the Apple store, five years after Apple kicked it out.\u00a0Trump factorApple\u2019s plans to diversify its production from China to India is also facing a potential roadblock with US President Donald Trump wanting more.\u00a0Trump recently criticised Apple\u2019s decision to build in India.\u00a0Trump wants Apple to manufacture in the US, which would cause a 13 times increase in manufacturing costs.\u00a0The move would reduce Apple\u2019s margins from its flagship product from $450 to just $60 if prices are not raised.\u00a0Cramer flags this also as a problem, as making iPhones in the US could erode \u201cone of the great American triumphs to rival smartphone maker Samsung, a Korean company\u201d, he said.He says that without Trump\u2019s blessing lot of havoc would happen against Apple.\u00a0The host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money also said the US regulators are looking into Apple\u2019s recent deal with Alibaba.Cramer said this partnership was the best source of new business for Apple in China.\u00a0He adds that these deals, which were once seen as an American strength, are now viewed as US weakness and a boost for China.OpenAI threatOpenAI\u2019s recent acquisition of a startup founded by former Apple design chief is also a concern for Cramer.\u00a0OpenAI\u2019s bid to make AI-enabled hardware is a question mark over Apple, according to Kramer.\u00a0He adds that while he is not worried about long-term prospects, he says he won\u2019t buy anymore stock in the current juncture.",

Altman said this marks the biggest thing we've ever done as a company, while Ive described it as a new design movement driven by years of collaboration after OpenAI's VP of Product began working with LoveFrom 18 months ago.Despite steering clear of phones or glasses, the team emphasized stealth to prevent rivals from copying the tech before a late-2026 launch.

Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

Investors who purchased Apple securities are encouraged to obtain additional information and assist the investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.Investigation DetailsOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced that it was indefinitely delaying promised updates to its Siri digital assistant. Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025.What's Next?If you are aware of any facts relating to this investigation or purchased Apple securities, you can assist this investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.

    "descriptionText": "The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday \u2014 because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a \"significant investment\" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H. Cho***Classes and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.Young people are also managing their finances in new ways. Generative artificial intelligence can take on the tedious task of budgeting, and the growing buy-now-pay-later industry grants the power to purchase almost anything in installments.MarketWatch spoke with money experts who offered advice on how to use the latest finance tools responsibly, and to remind graduates not to forget these tried and true personal finance habits.For more on this, read here.- Genna Contino***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert Steiner, Callum Keown This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and four new 52-week lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new 52-week highs and 92 new 52-week lows.Spike in Yields of U.S. Sovereign DebtYields on long-dated U.S. government securities spiked following the proposed tax-cut bill of the Trump administration. House republicans from Democrat-controlled states raised questions on the tax deduction allowed for state and local taxes (SALT) on federal income tax returns.\u00a0The 2017 Republican tax bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000 and the current tax bill has raised the limit to $30,000. But a section of Republican legislators disapproved it as not high enough. House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody\u2019s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa.\u00a0Moody\u2019s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government\u2019s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities.\u00a0As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February.\u00a0Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "OpenAI will acquire io, the secretive artificial intelligence hardware startup co-founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, in a landmark all-stock transaction valued at nearly $6.5 billion. The move is OpenAI\u2019s most significant acquisition to date and signals a determined push into developing physical consumer devices powered by AI.The purchase gives OpenAI access not only to io\u2019s team of around 55 engineers and designers but also to the creative vision of Ive, the British-born designer behind Apple\u2019s most iconic products including the iPhone, iPod, and MacBook Air. The acquisition also formalises a relationship that has been in the making for nearly two years, as Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have quietly explored new device ideas together.\u201cI have a growing sense that everything I\u2019ve learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place and to this moment,\u201d Ive said in a joint interview with Altman. OpenAI@OpenAI\u00b7Followhttps://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1925235156157440438Sam & Jony introduce ioWatch on TwitterView replies10:30 pm \u00b7 21 May 2025https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy0ReplyCopy linkRead more on TwitterOpenAI-io combine to release first hardware product in 2026OpenAI\u2019s acquisition includes a prior $1.5 billion investment stake in io made through its startup fund, along with a fresh $5 billion equity deal to absorb the company. The team, now under OpenAI\u2019s umbrella, will focus on building what Altman and Ive describe as \u201ca family of devices\u201d for the age of artificial general intelligence.The duo did not share specifics about the hardware under development but indicated that the first product would not simply be an iteration of the smartphone or laptop, but an entirely new computing form factor designed to complement AI\u2019s growing capabilities. \u201cPeople have an appetite for something new,\u201d Ive said, hinting at user fatigue with current devices.Altman added, \u201cAI is such a big leap forward in terms of what people can do that it needs a new kind of computing form factor to get the maximum potential out of it.\u201dThe first device from the collaboration is slated for release in 2026.Who is Jony Ive?Once described by Steve Jobs as his \u201cspiritual partner\u201d, Jony Ive\u2019s return to the heart of consumer technology marks a significant comeback for one of the most influential designers of the modern era. The British-born designer spent decades at Apple, where he worked closely with Steve Jobs to shape products that would define a generation, including the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple Watch. Ive left Apple in 2019 after a storied tenure, having played a central role in establishing the visual and tactile language of today\u2019s smartphones and personal devices.Sam Altman@sama\u00b7Followhttps://twitter.com/sama/status/1925242282523103408thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.Watch on TwitterView replies10:58 pm \u00b7 21 May 2025https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy0ReplyCopy linkRead more on TwitterAt the time of his departure, Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that Ive and the company would continue to collaborate, but no joint products ever materialized. After leaving Apple, Ive founded the design firm LoveFrom, a creative collective composed of former Apple colleagues and longtime collaborators. In 2023, he co-founded the startup io with Apple veterans Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan \u2014 each with deep experience in the company\u2019s hardware ecosystem. Acquisition brings ex-Apple hardware veterans to OpenAIThe acquisition also brings into OpenAI\u2019s fold a collection of ex-Apple hardware veterans who followed Ive after his departure from the tech giant in 2019.Among them are Scott Cannon, co-creator of the Mailbox app; Evans Hankey, Ive\u2019s successor at Apple; and Tang Tan, who led iPhone and Apple Watch product design until 2024.At io, the team had been developing devices suited for a future defined by artificial general intelligence\u2014where machines achieve human-like cognitive abilities. That mission now becomes part of OpenAI\u2019s strategy as it seeks to embed intelligence not just in software but across the physical world.The hardware ambitions are supported by other investors including Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Emerson Collective, Thrive Capital, Maverick Capital, and SV Angel. OpenAI confirmed that Altman holds no personal equity in io.Apple shares fall amid concerns over AI leadershipNews of the acquisition sent Apple shares down as much as 2.3% on Wednesday, as the market absorbed the implications of its former star designer now leading the charge at one of its AI rivals. Apple has been seen as lagging behind in artificial intelligence, with its recently introduced AI platform partly dependent on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.Analysts say the move could accelerate Apple\u2019s perceived decline in AI leadership and product innovation. \u201cJobs would be damn proud,\u201d Altman said of the new venture, praising Ive\u2019s creative legacy and calling their collaboration a \u201crare opportunity.\u201dThough the move poses potential competition for Apple, Altman and Ive were careful to note that their project does not aim to replace the smartphone. \u201cIn the same way that the smartphone didn\u2019t make the laptop go away, I don\u2019t think our first thing is going to make the smartphone go away,\u201d Altman said.Building AI\u2019s physical futureOpenAI\u2019s push into consumer hardware arrives as competition in AI intensifies. The company, currently valued at $300 billion, is racing to keep pace with rivals including Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. All are investing aggressively and rapidly launching new AI models and features.To support its expansion, OpenAI has bolstered its hardware and robotics expertise. In November, it hired Caitlin \u201cCK\u201d Kalinowski, the former head of Meta\u2019s Orion augmented reality glasses project, to lead its consumer hardware and robotics efforts. Kalinowski said the goal was to \u201cunlock AI\u2019s benefits for humanity\u201d through physical products.In a separate effort, OpenAI also invested in San Francisco-based robotics startup Physical Intelligence, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion valuation.

It's also true that many who buy one Apple product, like an iPhone, tend to buy another, like a MacBook, Luria noted.

If Apple products did take an additional 25% tariff hit, that would hurt earnings in the nearer term. However, the costs could be spread out by partially raising prices and passing some costs along to parts suppliers, Luria said. Additionally, Apple wouldn't be at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as Trump noted that Samsung (KR:005930) and other makers of smartphones would also be slapped with 25% tariffs on devices made overseas as they're imported to the U.S."

    "descriptionText": "By Laila MaidanApple's stock has sold off on tariff fears, but the company has a healthy business underpinned by a sticky ecosystem and robust array of services offeringsOne thing Apple users can agree on is that it's hard to imagine trading an iPhone or a MacBook for a Samsung smartphone or a Lenovo laptop. That's probably the biggest thing Apple has going for it amid the tariff noise.Yet Apple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) has been under pressure lately. As large technology stocks have roared back in May, Apple shares have missed out. The stock is down 8% so far this month. It's the only member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" that's in the red over that period, according to FactSet data. It's also the worst-performing stock of the bunch on a year-to-date basis, down 22%.Friday's tariff-related scare added to the pain. Apple's stock closed 3% lower to clinch its eighth loss in a row.Don't miss: Apple's stock falls as Trump makes a tariff threat on iPhones. Here's why it's misguided.But even as President Donald Trump threatened Apple on Friday with a 25% tariff if it didn't bring its manufacturing into the U.S., analysts aren't flinching and don't think investors should either. But that point comes with a caveat that's like a pilot telling passengers they're about to experience some turbulence. That's true, too, of Apple's stock. The short-term ride might be unpleasant, but arrival is still on time. So, if you're already invested, it's probably not a good idea to get off midflight.That said, over a three- to five-year timeframe, there's a lot of reason to be confident in the company's growth prospects because the products are part of an admirably sticky ecosystem, according to Gil Luria, the head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. His view is that the services tacked on to Apple's hardware products will keep customers coming back. It's also true that many who buy one Apple product, like an iPhone, tend to buy another, like a MacBook, Luria noted. In short, the recent stock weakness isn't a statement on the health of the business. It's more of a relationship issue between Trump and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.\"If you get to a point where the president is posting in such a confrontational manner, that means the negotiation isn't going well,\" said Luria.It's a setback, but it's not bad enough to send Luria back to his model to rework his outlook for the company. While an additional 25% tariff would hurt the company's profitability, he believes there's still a chance that negotiations between Apple and the White House could stave off the worst. If Apple products did take an additional 25% tariff hit, that would hurt earnings in the nearer term. However, the costs could be spread out by partially raising prices and passing some costs along to parts suppliers, Luria said. Additionally, Apple wouldn't be at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as Trump noted that Samsung (KR:005930) and other makers of smartphones would also be slapped with 25% tariffs on devices made overseas as they're imported to the U.S.Ask the Moneyist: Is now a good time to buy an iPhone?Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, chuckled and called the tariff threat \"noise,\" adding that it doesn't impact how he views Apple. \"I don't think you can take too much away from these headlines,\" he said. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that Cook's relationship with the president isn't as strong as it may once have been, he noted. Under the first Trump administration, Cook was able to secure a tariff exemption.Valuationwise, Apple's stock is trading at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, below its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. But Apple could see the slowest sales growth among the group, with a two-year estimated compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 5.1% through 2026. What that all means, said Luria, is that, despite slowed sales, investors still have a lot of confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Apple's stock trades at a premium compared with the S&P 500 SPX, which has a forward P/E of 21.2 and a two-year estimated sales CAGR slightly above Apple's at 5.6%. Meanwhile, Apple's forward P/E is slightly below that for the S&P 500 information-technology sector, which stands at 26.8. Yet the IT sector has a two-year sales CAGR more than double Apple's, at 11.3%.Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, says Apple's bigger problem is that Siri's integration with Apple Intelligence has fallen behand. The company is at risk of losing market share to any contender able to release life-changing generative AI services. That's something Mortonson believes could happen through Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Pixel phones or through Google's partnership with Samsung Galaxy and the integration of generative AI into that smartphone.That risk means he wouldn't suggest investors be overweight the stock, and he believes a stock like Alphabet is a better bet given its cheaper forward P/E at 17.3 with a two-year estimated sales CAGR double Apple's, at 10.7%.The next important event for Apple will be its Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 9.

    "descriptionText": "Apple is staring down a major supply chain and pricing dilemma after President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the United States unless the tech giant begins manufacturing the devices domestically. Trump\u2019s remarks, posted on Truth Social and reiterated later to reporters at the White House, are the latest escalation in his push for US-based production by large multinationals.\u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d Trump wrote, warning that otherwise \u201ca Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple.\u201dThe president\u2019s comments come as Apple has been ramping up production in India, seeking to diversify away from its heavy reliance on Chinese manufacturing amid rising geopolitical tensions and pandemic-era disruptions. CEO Tim Cook recently said more iPhones sold in the US would be made in India, a shift that may now be politically fraught.Analysts say iPhone making in the US unfeasible; say threat a negotiation tacticApple shares dropped almost 3% on Friday trading following Trump\u2019s post, falling to $195.44. The prospect of steep tariffs raised concerns across financial markets, with analysts warning of significant cost implications and logistical hurdles should Apple try to comply.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives estimated that manufacturing iPhones in the US could push retail prices to $3,500, a dramatic increase from today\u2019s average $1,000. \u201cWe see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near-term given the upside down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note on Friday.Morningstar analyst William Kerwin echoed those sentiments, describing domestic iPhone manufacturing as unfeasible in the medium term. \u201cTo us, this is a negotiating tactic aimed at driving greater US investment from Apple, likely in the form of domestic chip investment and potentially production of lower-volume devices than the flagship iPhone,\u201d he said.Potential strategies for Apple under tariff threatFaced with this new pressure, Apple may explore various strategies to blunt the impact of a potential tariff hike.Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring suggested that Apple could cut less profitable models from its iPhone lineup, focusing instead on higher-margin units to reduce the blow. A \u201ctargeted iPhone mix shift could significantly minimize the tariff headwind,\u201d Woodring wrote in a note to clients last month.Another option floated by analysts involves stretching the product release cycle. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple could switch from an annual to a biennial launch schedule, simplifying supply chains and production timelines.Apple may also decide to confront the administration directly, publicly tying higher prices to Trump\u2019s trade stance. One proposal discussed in analyst circles is for Apple to add a \u201ctariff surcharge\u201d to each US sales receipt, making consumers aware of how much more they\u2019re paying because of the new tariffs.Constraints that limit Apple\u2019s US productionFor now, most analysts agree that relocating iPhone production to the US is impractical. Apple\u2019s manufacturing relies heavily on China-based partner Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers and taps into a dense web of suppliers, logistics firms, and engineers\u2014none of which are easily replicable in the US.\u201cThe idea of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\u201d Ives said, adding that even if the company decided to pursue the move, it would take five to ten years to make it a reality.The challenges are not new. In 2011, when President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the US, Jobs reportedly replied, \u201cThose jobs aren\u2019t coming back,\u201d referring to Asia\u2019s unmatched industrial infrastructure and labour scale.Some of Apple\u2019s suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, are expanding US operations under pressure. However, Foxconn appears unlikely to significantly boost its American footprint. The firm scaled back a highly publicized $10 billion Wisconsin plant and has instead committed $1.49 billion to its India operations.Likely bearing of 25% tariff on Apple\u2019s earningsUBS analyst David Vogt estimated that if a 25% tariff were applied to 70 million iPhones annually imported from China and India, Apple\u2019s earnings per share could take a hit of about $0.51. Wall Street currently expects Apple to earn $7.18 per share this fiscal year.As pressure mounts from Washington, Apple is left navigating a volatile mix of political demands, economic realities, and consumer expectations.

    "descriptionText": "Berber JinOpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave his staff a preview Wednesday of the devices he is developing to build with former Apple designer Jony Ive, laying out plans to ship 100 million AI \"companions\" that he hopes will become a part of everyday life.Altman told employees that they had \"the chance to do the biggest thing we've ever done as a company here,\" he said after announcing OpenAI's plans to purchase Ive's startup, named io, and give him an expansive creative and design role. He suggested the $6.5 billion acquisition has the potential to add $1 trillion in value to OpenAI, according to a recording reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.In the meeting, Ive noted how closely he worked with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs before his passing in 2011. With Altman, \"the way that we clicked, and the way that we've been able to work together, has been profound for me.\"Altman and Ive offered a few hints at the secret project they have been working on. The product will be capable of being fully aware of a user's surroundings and life, will be unobtrusive, able to rest in one's pocket or on one's desk, and would be a third core device a person would put on their desk after a MacBook Pro and an iPhone.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the device won't be a phone, and that Ive and Altman's intent is to help wean users off of screens. Altman said the device also isn't a pair of glasses, and that Ive had been skeptical about building something to wear on the body.Ive referenced \"a new design movement.\" Altman said it would amount to a \"family of devices,\" bringing up his fondness for how Apple has long integrated its hardware and software offerings.Altman told OpenAI staff that stealth will be important for their ultimate success to avoid competitors copying the product before it's ready.For months, Ive's team has been speaking with vendors who will be able to ship the device at scale. \"We're not going to ship 100 million devices literally on day one,\" Altman said, predicting that OpenAI would ship that large quantity of high-quality devices \"faster than any company has ever shipped 100 million of something new before.\" Altman said the goal is to release a device by late next year.The grandiose plans echo Altman's bold vision for OpenAI's expansion in many spheres, including for data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars, enterprise technology, chatbots, personal robots and beyond.Rolling out new devices, especially ones that will compete with deep-pocketed, multitrillion-dollar companies like Apple or Google, has long been among the most difficult of challenges in the tech industry. Humane, another startup made up of former Apple executives that Altman invested in, sold an \"Ai Pin\" that failed to catch on with consumers.And OpenAI is already bleeding cash. The startup told investors last fall it won't generate a profit until 2029, and it expects to lose $44 billion before doing so, the Journal has reported.While Apple and Google have struggled to keep pace with AI innovations, many investors see the two companies \u2014 whose software runs nearly all the world's smartphones \u2014 as the primary means through which billions of people will access AI tools and chatbots. Building a device is the only way OpenAI and other artificial-intelligence companies will be able to interact with consumers directly.Altman and Ive also offered details about how their collaboration grew in the last several years. Eighteen months ago, OpenAI's Vice President of Product Peter Welinder began working with Ive's team. The two sides became excited about a specific device last fall.The original plan was for Ive's startup to build and sell its own device using OpenAI's technology, but Altman said he eventually realized that wouldn't work. Altman said he knew the two companies would have to be combined because the device wasn't just an accessory but a central facet of the user relationship with OpenAI.\"We both got excited about the idea that, if you subscribed to ChatGPT, we should just mail you new computers, and you should use those,\" Altman said.Altman said he and Ive came to believe that existing devices wouldn't work.

    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns.

    "descriptionText": "By Joseph Adinolfi and Joy WiltermuthWorries about rising bond yields are coming home to roost, sending the Dow down 800 pointsInvestors have been warily eyeing rising Treasury yields since the start of May, with some fretting that the latest jump in borrowing costs could soon start hurting stocks.Those fears were realized on Wednesday, as a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields climbing to fresh highs. Borrowing costs tied to long-dated debt touched levels not seen since late 2023.That sent stocks reeling, with major indexes tallying their worst session since April 21, Dow Jones Market Data showed.\"Looks like we are sinking,\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said after the weak 20-year bond auction.The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was knocking on the door of the 4.6% level, and concerns about tariffs and \"the battle of the budget\" remain, he said.Republicans are working to pass President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" budget bill. The latest version of the legislation included tax and spending cuts but would do little to pare the U.S. budget deficit.\"When you have yields jumping up like this, it's a tough crosscurrent for stocks,\" Cardillo said.Stocks had shaken off some of their early losses heading into the afternoon, as gains for Big Tech names like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into the green.But around 1 p.m., the market suffered a one-two punch. Reports that OpenAI would buy an artificial-intelligence company founded by former Apple Inc. (AAPL) design chief Jony Ive appeared to weigh on shares of Ive's former employer.Around the same time, the weak 20-year BX:TMUBMUSD20Y auction helped revive concerns about waning foreign demand for U.S. debt. Suddenly, investors were starting to question how the U.S. would manage its debt burden over the long term.This, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy, was enough to weigh on stocks, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Management.See: Why the next 20-year Treasury auction is 'must-see TV' for investors after the Moody's downgrade\"It's a question of how much growth are we going to get, and what is the revenue stream for the U.S. government looking like to support the debt that they're issuing,\" he said.Mulberry also pointed out that pain in debt markets was a global phenomenon on Wednesday, as yields on bonds trading in Japan and Europe also spiked.Earlier, investors digested weak earnings from Target Corp. (TGT), along with a report from fellow retailer TJX Cos. (TJX), the parent of TJ Maxx, which Mulberry described as not as bad as Target's, but still not great. Shares of both companies were selling off.Meanwhile, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) fell further, heaping more pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was also weakening, signaling that the \"Sell America\" trade might be back on, at least for now. Meanwhile, gold (GC00) and bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed, with the latter hitting a fresh record high north of $109,000 per coin.The S&P 500 SPX finished 95.85 points, or 1.6%, lower at 5,844.61, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 270.07 points, or 1.4%, at 18,872.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 816.80 points, or 1.9%, to 41,860.44.-Joseph Adinolfi -Joy WiltermuthThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

As of now, it seems to me things are off to a bad start.\"Arnault, who first met Trump when the two men were real-estate developers in New York in the 1980s, also warned against adopting a confrontational tone.\"If we threaten him \u2014 if we say, for example, 'We're coming in and we're going to take this or that measure,' or, 'We no longer want our companies to invest in the United States' \u2014 we'll get the opposite result,\" Arnault said.After Trump raised tariffs on goods made in China, Apple accelerated its effort to make most U.S.-bound iPhones in India. Such a move would allow it to claim India as the \"country of origin\" and pay the lower duties facing that nation.Bessent, in his Friday interview with Fox, said the administration is trying to persuade Apple to build semiconductors in the U.S.\"I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities...is this external production, especially in semiconductors. A large part of Apple's components are in semiconductors,\" Bessent said. \"We would like to have Apple help us make the semiconductor supply chain more secure.\"Bessent said he met with Cook this week.Technology experts have said that while shifting some iPhone manufacturing to America is possible, building the full stack of iPhone components and assembling it in the U.S. would be challenging and costly. IPhones contain a patchwork of sophisticated parts, sourced from many countries and put together primarily in China. America doesn't have facilities that resemble the infrastructure developed in China, nor does it have skilled manpower to assemble iPhones at that scale.Apple shares declined slightly more than the market, but not to an extent that indicates investor concern that the company would be subject to the 25% tariffs on foreign-made iPhones. \"The market is obviously concluding that this is just a negotiation,\" said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson.He said he expects the eventual outcome for Apple will be for the company to make some additional components in the U.S., but not iPhones themselves.Write to Gavin Bade at gavin.bade@wsj.com, Meridith McGraw at Meridith.McGraw@WSJ.com and Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com",

The Nasdaq Composite fell 1% at 18,737.2. The S&P 500 dropped 0.7% to 5,802.8, marking the fourth straight day of declines, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 0.6% to 41,603.1. Among sectors, technology saw the biggest drop, while utilities paced the gainers. The three benchmarks are down more than 2% each this week. US markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Trump recommended a 50% tariff rate on the EU, effective June 1, saying that talks with the bloc had stalled. The announcement has \"reignited\" concerns about a transatlantic trade war, ING Bank said. Separately, Trump threatened to impose at least 25% tariffs on Apple if the tech giant sticks to its policy of manufacturing iPhones outside the US. Apple shares declined 3%. Producing iPhones in the US is not \"feasible\" due to pricing and supply chain challenges, Wedbush Securities said in a client note, calling the idea a \"fairy tale.\"\"Today's announced threat may be a goad to European leaders to negotiate more quickly with the US,\" Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report. \"In any case, the news reiterates our cautious guidance of recent weeks, namely, that new tariffs (and, as today, threats of tariffs) remain material risks to financial markets, especially when the announcements come as surprises.\"US Treasury yields were lower, with the 10-year rate decreasing 4.4 basis points to 4.51% and the two-year rate losing nearly one basis point to 3.99%.

Apple said it had asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to affect \"Fortnite\" in other geographies.On Monday, the same judge that presided over the 2021 case effectively demanded that Apple approve the reinstatement of \"Fortnite\" on the App Store or send a representative to court to prove it had a basis for not doing so, according to court records seen by The Wall Street Journal.Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on the reinstatement of \"Fortnite.\"Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",

Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

(\"Apple\" or \"the Company\") NASDAQ:AAPL . Investors who purchased Apple securities are encouraged to obtain additional information and assist the investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.Investigation DetailsOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced that it was indefinitely delaying promised updates to its Siri digital assistant. Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025.What's Next?If you are aware of any facts relating to this investigation or purchased Apple securities, you can assist this investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company's prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Following the judge's order, Gambini shells out the money to buy a brand new suit and tie, and thus satisfy the judge's edict to look \"lawyerly\" while defending his clients in the judge's courtroom.

    "descriptionText": "By Ben RoseAbout the author: Ben Rose is president of Battle Road Research, an independent equity-research firm.Apple CEO Tim Cook's response to President Donald Trump's made-in-America push calls to mind a scene in the movie My Cousin Vinny. Vincent Gambini (played by Joe Pesci), a novice defense attorney, is scolded by Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) for showing up in his Alabama courtroom without a suit and tie, with the judge taking particular offense to Gambini's long leather jacket. When Gambini returns to the courtroom for his next appearance he is dressed the same way, but this time the judge holds in him contempt of court. Gambini, in disbelief, says to the judge: \"You were serious about that?\"While Apple was entirely \u2014 some might say miraculously \u2014 spared from tariffs during Trump's first term, the president has vowed that now \"no one gets off the hook,\" not even America's most valuable company by market capitalization. And this time, he is serious. Apple will need to move some of its production to the U.S.During the first Trump administration, many U.S. companies that manufactured their products in China faced a 25% tariff. Some companies responded by moving production to other low-labor-cost countries in the region, such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and India, to avoid the tariff penalty. Even though it had received an exemption, Apple, no doubt mindful of the growing tension between Washington and Beijing, began to move a portion of its iPhone production to India, in an effort to diversify its supply chain and manufacturing.At the start of the president's second term, companies were unsure whether the president's goal was to negotiate better trade deals, reduce reliance on China, or move more manufacturing back to the U.S. This time around, Apple wasn't going to take any chances. Just 35 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, Apple unveiled plans to invest $500 billion (with a b) in the U.S. over the next four years to construct new manufacturing facilities, AI data centers, create 20,000 new jobs, and establish a manufacturing academy focused on workforce training.Having taken public steps to satisfy the president's wishes, Apple's executives likely breathed a further sigh of relief when U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared on April 13 that computers and semiconductors would receive a 90-day reprieve from the president's scorching level of 145% tariffs on goods from China. Apple and others would be subject to a separate set of tariffs to be determined at a future date. Perhaps calculating that Trump's ultimate goal was simply to move manufacturing out of China, Apple announced a significant expansion of its production operations in India, presumably with the view that the president would not mind where its iPhones are made \u2014 so long as they are not made in China.But like Vincent Gambini, Tim Cook is learning the hard way that the president is serious about Apple making its products in the U. S. \u2014 ASAP \u2014 rather than potentially taking its sweet time by further expanding production in India.The pushback from Apple and others is that labor rates in the U.S. will make their products uncompetitive in the U.S., with some suggesting American-manufactured iPhones would cost U.S. consumers as much as $3,500.Apple is at least partially right, since labor costs in China and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region are a fraction of what they would be in the U.S. In addition, Apple has invested billions of dollars in China, and has nurtured a reliable supply chain that meets its rigorous quality standards. Moving production to India or the U.S. is likely to result not only in higher costs, but a reduction in product quality. As a practical matter, not all of the components in Apple's products are made in America. So what is a practical solution to this standoff?Back to Vincent Gambini and Judge Haller. Following the judge's order, Gambini shells out the money to buy a brand new suit and tie, and thus satisfy the judge's edict to look \"lawyerly\" while defending his clients in the judge's courtroom. Apple's response might be to shell out the money to build or lease final assembly facilities in the U.S., while utilizing at least some amount of U.S.-based content, as well as contract manufacturers. It could also outsource prototyping, production, and bridge manufacturing to local companies that would welcome the work. In doing so, Apple would save a bundle on transportation costs from the Asia Pacific region, while at the same time demonstrate a good faith effort to more rapidly increase manufacturing and high tech jobs in the U.S. Otherwise, like Gambini and the judge, it will find out just how serious Trump was all along.Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's newsroom.

The two companies have been locked in a legal back-and-forth ever since.\"Fortnite is BACK on the App Store in the U.S. on iPhones and iPads... and on the Epic Games Store and AltStore in the E.U! It'll show up in Search soon!,\" Epic Games said in a post on X.The reinstatement comes days after Epic Games said Apple had blocked the \"Fortnite\" app it had resubmitted for review, preventing it from releasing to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union.Apple last week said it had asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to affect \"Fortnite\" in other geographies. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on the reinstatement of \"Fortnite.\"Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com",

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back \u2014 and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. \"The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,\" Ive said in the merger announcement video.\"Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'\" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. \"Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it.

Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

QuoteApple\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector\u2019s 25.5X, Alphabet\u2019s 17.06X, Dell Technologies\u2019 12.41X and HP\u2019s 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.Price/Earnings (F12M)AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Trades Below 200-day SMA\u00a0Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple\u2019s near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company\u2019s prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

The Nasdaq Composite underperformed, slipping 0.9 percent as big tech stocks bore the brunt of the pressure.Apple led the tech rout, falling over 2 percent after Trump took aim at the company in a post on Truth Social. He warned that iPhones sold in the United States should be manufactured domestically \u2014 or else face a 25 percent tariff. This marks the first time Trump has zeroed in on a specific company as part of his renewed push for tariffs this year.Semiconductor stocks also struggled. Shares of Micron and Qualcomm both fell 2 percent, while Nvidia gave up 1 percent.Adding to the market\u2019s jitters, Trump said trade talks with the European Union were \u201cgoing nowhere,\u201d and floated the idea of slapping a 50 percent tariff on EU goods beginning June 1, 2025.In April, Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffs had rattled investors and pushed the S&P 500 close to bear market territory. A temporary 90-day reprieve, along with tentative deals with the U.K. and China, had helped stocks bounce back, with the benchmark index just recently reclaiming its year-to-date gains.Investors had been betting on more trade breakthroughs during this pause. But Friday\u2019s comments revived fears that the worst may not be over.The losses capped a tough week for Wall Street, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all sliding more than 2 percent.All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were on track to end the week in the red.

    "descriptionText": "US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500\u2019s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody\u2019s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors \u201cbuy the dip\u201dRetail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody\u2019s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan\u2019s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET\u2014the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index\u2019s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody\u2019s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year.

    "descriptionText": "The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday \u2014 because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar.

President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H.

House Speaker Mike Johnson introduced changes to President Trump's tax-cut bill, including a more generous deduction for SALT with more changes to the package additional concessions.A rough estimate has shown that the proposed tax cut will generate $3 to $5 trillion extra burden on the U.S. government exchequer. The United States is currently facing a gigantic $36.2 trillion fiscal deficit. On May 16, after the closing bell, Moody\u2019s Investor Services downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa1 from Aaa.\u00a0Moody\u2019s is the third major rating agency after the S&P 500 Global and Fitch to downgrade the U.S. sovereign credit rating. The rating agency cited the growing burden of financing the federal government\u2019s outstanding budget deficit of a mammoth $36 trillion and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt under the high-interest rate regime.Given the concerns of the U.S. fiscal prudence, on May 21, the auction for 20-Year U.S. Treasury Notes had a lackluster demand from investors. Market participants shorted long-dated government securities.\u00a0As a result, yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note last traded around 5.09%, touching the highest level going back to October 2023. Similarly, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked to 4.59%, its highest level since mid-February.\u00a0Economic DataFor the week ended May 16, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels from the previous week.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "Apple NASDAQ:AAPL Chief Executive Tim Cook called Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week, asking him to change or veto a new bill that would require app stores to verify the age of users and link minors' accounts to their parents, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing unnamed people familiar with the call. Despite Apple's efforts, the bill passed the Texas legislature with veto-proof support. \"The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk,\" a spokesperson for Abbott was quoted as saying. To push back, Apple has hired more lobbyists and funded ads against the bill, the report added. The law, dubbed App Store accountability law, would make Apple and similar tech companies responsible for confirming a device owner's age and notifying parents when a child wants to download an app. \"If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,\" an Apple spokesman was quoted as saying. The bill is part of a broader wave of age-verification laws being introduced across the US, the report added. Apple didn't immediately reply to MT Newswires' request for comment.",

    "descriptionText": "By Laila MaidanInvestors should still watch rising bond yields, which could eat into appetites for high-growth tech stocksWhile technology stocks had a volatile reaction to two other major U.S. credit downgrades in recent years, Friday's latest rating cut from Moody's isn't expected to punch a dent in tech stocks this year.Moody's (MCO) adjustment to the U.S. government's credit rating was from Aaa to Aa1, a notch down on the firm's 21-notch rating scale. The firm cited the increase in government debt over the past 10 years, as well as interest-payment ratios that have reached levels significantly above countries with similar ratings, as the reasons.When S&P Global downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from AAA to a AA+ in 2011, the stock market had a big reaction because there were many unknowns, including how institutional investors would shift their positions based on their mandates. And when investors feel uncertain, they sell first and ask questions later, said Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer of Syz Group. Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

While advocates of his plan applaud the hard-line approach, as it promises to bring a new economic reality to the U.S. and its trading partners, investors are back to frowning at the oceans of uncertainty they are once again directly faced with.The Dow is currently down -560 points, roughly -1.3%, while the S&P 500 is -90, -1.5%. The Nasdaq, which has been reinvigorated by recent AI-related growth items, has fallen -400 points, -1.9%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -45, -2.1%. It was only earlier this week we were putting in top trading levels for the past month. It may take some major trade deals to turn this back around.\u00a0Trump is warning Apple AAPL will be facing additional +25% tariffs on iPhones made overseas \u2014 whether in China as they are currently or India, as Apple CEO Tim Cook has proposed \u2014 unless they are produced here in the U.S. Employing an American workforce to produce iPhones is, stated mildly, not in the cards for the company.

US debt now stands at $36.22 trillion, just about doubling in the past 10 years alone, Stifel said in a note. Citing the Congressional Budget Office, Stifel expects debt to rise to over $59 trillion in the decade ahead. The ICE US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's performance against the world's major currencies, slumped 0.7% to 100.43. Gold futures increased 1.5% to $3,235.51 per ounce. Moody's downgrade confirms that fiscal health issues remain significant, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note Monday. Debates around related government policies will likely intensify over the next three months, especially as Congress attempts to reconcile the budget, extend tax cuts, and increase the debt ceiling. \"The US Treasury market remains the largest and most liquid in the world, and we anticipate no imminent change to the importance of the US Treasury market to global investors,\" the WFII note said. US Treasury yields jumped intraday. The US 10-year was up 4.8 basis points to 4.49%, after hitting 4.54% earlier in the day. The 30-year rate jumped 5.5 basis points to 4.95%, after trading at around 5.03% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, in economic news, the Conference Board's measure of leading indicators fell by 1% in April, compared with expectations for a 0.9% decrease in a Bloomberg-compiled survey and a 0.8% decline in March. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures jumped 1.4% to $63.36 a barrel. In company news, Apple NASDAQ:AAPL is facing scrutiny from the White House and congressional officials over its plan to use Alibaba Group's NYSE:BABA artificial intelligence technology on iPhones in China, The New York Times reported Saturday, citing three people familiar with the matter. Apple's shares fell 1.2% intraday, among the worst performers on the Dow.",

    "descriptionText": "Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are well-known personal computer (PC) makers in a market that is expected to see year-over-year shipment growth of 2.1% in 2025, per IDC. Global PC shipment is expected to witness a CAGR of 0.4% between 2025 and 2029 to hit 422.6 million in 2029. Commercial shipment is expected to grow 4.3% year over year to 138 million and witness a CAGR of 0.8% between 2025 and 2029 to hit 142.6 million.\u00a0Meanwhile, U.S. shipment growth is expected to be 1.7% to hit 70.4 million in 2025, per Canalys. For 2026, the shipment is expected to grow 1.9% to 71.7 million. Commercial is expected to 6.3% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, while consumer is expected to remain flat year over year in 2025 and increase 1.1% in 2026.The growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) powered PCs and Microsoft Windows 10 end-of-service in October 2025 are key catalysts. Gartner expects AI PCs (PC with an embedded neural processing unit) global shipments to hit 114 million units in 2025, a jump of 165.5% from 2024.So, Apple or HP, which is a better buy under the current scenario?The Case for Apple StockApple\u2019s Mac business is benefiting from strong demand for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. In March, Apple expanded its Mac portfolio with the new MacBook Air powered by the M4 chip with up to 18 hours of battery life and a new 12MP Center Stage camera. Apple also announced the new Mac Studio featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The new chip is the most powerful created by Apple and features double Neural Engine cores, Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2 times the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion.Apple\u2019s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in the first quarter of 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 8.7%, up 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 14.1% year over year to hit 5.5 million. According to Gartner, Mac shares inched up 20 bps while shipments increased 7% year over year.The availability of Apple Intelligence globally with macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India, bodes well for Mac\u2019s prospects.The Case for HP StockGrowing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP\u2019s PC sales. The company had earlier suggested that AI PCs could be a key growth driver beginning this year. It forecasted that 40-60% of all PCs will be AI PCs in the next three years. To make the most of the growing opportunities in this category, HP has launched several AI PCs this year and plans to continue to expand its AI PC portfolio.However, HP faces meaningful downside risk if the U.S.-China tariff war escalates. The company relies heavily on China for manufacturing and assembling many of its PCs, printers, and related components. Higher import tariffs on Chinese-made goods would raise HP\u2019s production costs, forcing the company to either absorb the margin pressure or pass on costs to consumers, both negative outcomes.Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.2%, up 20 bps on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of calendar 2025. Shipment grew 6.1% year over year to hit 12.8 million.HPQ & AAPL\u2019s Earnings Estimate Revision Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ\u2019s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.39 per share, down 1.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 0.3% increase over fiscal 2025\u2019s reported figure.HP Inc.

    "descriptionText": "By Angela Palumbo and Mackenzie TatananniOpenAI said Wednesday that it was buying a start-up owned by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief design officer, for $6.4 billion. The all-stock deal to acquire artificial intelligence device-maker io includes OpenAI's current stake in the company.In a statement alongside Ive, CEO Sam Altman said io would merge with OpenAI \"to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco,\" while Ive and LoveFrom, his so-called creative collective, would assume \"design and creative responsibilities.\"In a video posted to OpenAI's website, Altman said the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI \"to create all sorts of wonderful things.\"Any products from the merged companies may still be a while off. The video signs off with a slide that says: \"We look forward to sharing our work next year.\"Apple stock was down about 2% on the news. That company has its own family of devices, including the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops and the iPad. Investors have been looking for signs from the tech giant that its own AI software, Apple Intelligence, can incentivize people to purchase its products. But the rollout of this software has been slower than Wall Street would like.The merger between io and OpenAI, with the promise to make a \"family of devices,\" powered by AI, seems to have made Apple investors even more wary.Barron's has reached out to Apple for comment.In an attempt to broaden its AI reach, Apple teamed up with OpenAI in 2024 to integrate ChatGPT capabilities into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By Keach Hagey and Berber JinJony Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and his design firm are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, where they will develop consumer devices and other projects that will shape the future look and feel of AI.OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, have been working on a new device that will move consumers beyond screens, according to people familiar with the matter. They have been collaborating for two years on a closely guarded project, considering options including headphones and other devices with cameras, the people said.The partnership between Ive, a visionary designer, and OpenAI, which has transformed how consumers seek information, could herald a new era of AI-powered consumer technology. It puts a seasoned designer at the creative helm of a fast-growing startup that aims to one day have a hand in everything from devices to AI-powered robots, AI models with humanlike intelligence and a global network of data centers.The former Apple employee's work at OpenAI will extend across all the company's ventures, from future versions of ChatGPT to audio features, its app and other products, according to people familiar with the matter.London-born Ive left Apple in 2019 to found LoveFrom, a design firm that has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb and the luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. Ive also leads io, a company founded last year to design and develop a new family of AI-powered products.As part of an unusual deal announced Wednesday, OpenAI will also acquire io in an all-equity deal that values it at $6.5 billion. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in the company late last year, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI's startup fund also invested at the time.The acquisition of the rest of Ive's io puts an executive who helped change the relationship between consumers and technology at the forefront of development of devices that move consumers away from screens.Io's staff of roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI, while LoveFrom continues to operate independently.OpenAI will be a customer of LoveFrom and LoveFrom will receive a stake in OpenAI, people familiar with the matter said. The companies expect the transaction to close this summer pending regulatory approval.\"I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the last 30 years has led me to this moment,\" Ive said.

Let's take a closer look at the benefits and the announcements of each.Benefits of Stock BuybacksStock buybacks, also known as share repurchase programs, are commonly deployed by companies to boost shareholder value.A stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves. Reducing the number of outstanding shares can boost earnings per share (EPS), also helping to put a floor under shares, reflective of consistent buying pressure.Still, it's worth mentioning that buybacks can sometimes bring out critics, as some believe the cash could be better deployed elsewhere, such as R&D. Nonetheless, buybacks are generally a net positive for shareholders, particularly those of mature companies with a much smaller growth runway.ANET Benefits from AIArista Networks' latest set of quarterly results beat our consensus EPS and sales estimates handily, with revenue of $2.0 billion showing nearly 30% growth year-over-year. The company's sales growth has been fueled by the AI frenzy, as the company is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus, and routing environments.The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with EPS expectations increasing across the board. Arista Networks unveiled an additional $1.5 billion repurchase program in the release.Apple Unveils Massive Stock BuybackDown 15% year-to-date, Apple shares have struggled in 2025, underperforming relative to the S&P 500 in a big way and driven lower by initial tariff headlines. Shares faced pressure as a result, but the recent de-escalation announcement between the US and China has brought back positivity.Apple unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting some of its cash to work. The earnings outlook for the tech titan remains under pressure, with analysts taking their EPS expectations lower across the board over recent months.The evolving EPS outlook of Apple is certainly going to be interesting, particularly so amid all the back-and-forth news we've received concerning tariffs and other economic developments. It's worth remembering that the company is no longer the growth machine it used to be, with EPS forecasted to climb 6% on 3% higher sales in its current fiscal year.AIT Generates Serious CashApplied Industrial Technologies exceeded both our consensus EPS and sales estimates, with EPS growing 4% YoY on the back of a 2% sales increase. The company's cash-generating abilities saw a notable boost throughout its latest period, with free cash flow of $115 million up 50% YoY.The cash-generating abilities have allowed the company to sport a shareholder-friendly nature, currently boasting a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. AIT unveiled a new repurchase program to buy up to 1.5 million shares, replacing the prior repurchase plan.Bottom LineCompanies commonly deploy repurchase programs to boost shareholder value, all of which we've recently seen from these companies listed above.All three have been aggressively buying shares over recent years, helping put in a floor while also aiding EPS. Though buybacks are criticized by some, they make great sense for mature companies with little growth left to squeeze.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",

Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays.

    "descriptionText": "By Britney NguyenPresident Donald Trump said Apple must pay a 25% tariff if it doesn't rely on domestic production of iPhones for the U.S. marketShares of Apple Inc. were down more than 2% shortly after Friday's open after President Donald Trump threatened the company with a tariff if it doesn't make iPhones for the U.S. market stateside. One analyst called Trump's dream of domestic iPhone production a \"fairy tale.\"\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) that I expect their [iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.\"However, analysts at Evercore ISI said in April they didn't see iPhone production moving into the U.S., \"as the higher labor costs alone would drive a >50% increase in iPhone manufacturing costs\" - double the tariff Trump is now threatening to put on Apple.\"This implies that even under a 50% global baseline tariff it would not make financial sense to produce the iPhone domestically,\" Evercore said last month.Earlier this month, the president said he \"had a little problem\" with the Apple chief during a meeting between the two in Qatar. Trump has taken issue with the iPhone maker's further expansion into India. Apple doesn't produce any smartphones in the U.S., but has been diversifying its supply chain away from China since pandemic-era lockdowns and as geopolitical tensions between the two countries have intensified. The company has moved production into countries including India and Vietnam, but the Trump administration is still pushing for the company to bring its manufacturing stateside.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.As Trump floated massive tariffs on goods imported from China earlier this year, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, pointed out that most of the components used in iPhones are made abroad.\"If U.S. tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come,\" Ives said in an April note. An iPhone made in the U.S. could cost $3,500, Ives said - more than double the current $1,000 price tag.Ives reiterated his point in a note on Friday, saying that building iPhones in the U.S. \"would result in an iPhone price point that is a non-starter for Cupertino and translate into iPhone prices of $3,500 if it was made in the US.\"He estimated that shifting production to the U.S. would take between five to 10 years, and called the idea \"a fairy tale that is not feasible.\"In April, analysts at Gimme Credit said moving some iPhone production to the U.S. \"cannot be done immediately.\"\"It would take meaningful time and money to build and develop the physical infrastructure,\" the analysts said. \"More importantly, it is doubtful that the U.S. could provide the necessary labor force, both in terms of quality and quantity.\"The analysts noted that Apple would likely still have to import some components from China.India produced about 20% of Apple's iPhones - or more than 40 million devices - in the past year ending in March, according to Bloomberg.

    "descriptionText": "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL \u2013 May 21, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digit year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digit. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation. However, expanding Apple Intelligence bodes well for the company's prospects.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

    "descriptionText": "By Ian SalisburyShares of online car retailer Carvana rallied some 5% on Tuesday after CEO Ernie Garcia argued that tariffs could boost used-car sales. Analysts agree: They expect Carvana's operating profits to more than double in 2025 and jump another 25% in 2026.But Carvana's high share price, at 58 times expected 2025 earnings, already reflects that optimism and requires a lot to go right in uncertain times. Investors might do better with another stock with a much cheaper valuation: Group 1 Automotive, which rallied 1.2% to more than $448 on Tuesday after Citigroup's Michael Ward raised his target price to $495 from $463.Group 1 owns more than 330 auto franchises. Wall Street sees relatively modest profit growth: 3.8% in 2025, 6.6% in 2026. But shares trade at less than 11 times 2025 earnings. About 50% of Group 1's revenue comes from new-vehicle sales, compared with 33% for used vehicles, notes CFRA. If tariffs steer shoppers toward used cars instead of new ones, that could cut into Group 1's biggest market.Still, Ward notes, 25% of Group 1's revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where U.S. tariff plans mean little. He says its multiple could expand as memories of the Covid-era industry's dislocations fade. \"Dealer stocks are valued at a 15% discount to pre-Covid levels despite better-than-expected financial performance during and after the crises,\" he wrote, giving an opportunity for Group 1's double-digit revenue growth in 2025-26.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsThe U.S. and China cut tariffs for 90 days: U.S. on China goods to 30%, China on U.S. goods to 10%. Stocks, Treasury yields, and the dollar rose; gold fell. The Nasdaq surged 4%, the S&P 500 more than 3%. April inflation fell to 2.3%, and investors unwound Federal Reserve rate-cut trades. Stocks fell after UnitedHealth Group suspended guidance, the CEO quit, an old one returned, and The Wall Street Journal reported it was under investigation for Medicare fraud. Oil slipped on upbeat comments from President Trump on Iran talks. On the week, the Dow industrials rose 3.4%; the S&P 500, 5.3%; and the Nasdaq Composite, 7.2%. After the Friday close, Moody's downgraded U.S. credit over rising debt, ending its last triple-A rating.CompaniesTrump headed to the Middle East, eager for deals. The trip began with Qatar offering him a used Boeing 747 as a new Air Force One and agreeing to buy 210 new Boeing jets; the Saudis and United Arab Emirates bought artificial-intelligence chips. Trump told drug companies to cut U.S. prices by as much as 80%. FedEx will pick up some Amazon.com deliveries that UPS shed. Samsung beat Apple to market with a thin smartphone. Coinbase Global revealed a hack just as it was set to join the S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial, which is being bought by Capital One.DealsMicrosoft and OpenAI are rewriting their partnership.

Apple\u2019s manufacturing relies heavily on China-based partner Foxconn, which employs hundreds of thousands of workers and taps into a dense web of suppliers, logistics firms, and engineers\u2014none of which are easily replicable in the US.\u201cThe idea of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\u201d Ives said, adding that even if the company decided to pursue the move, it would take five to ten years to make it a reality.The challenges are not new. In 2011, when President Barack Obama asked Apple co-founder Steve Jobs what it would take to make iPhones in the US, Jobs reportedly replied, \u201cThose jobs aren\u2019t coming back,\u201d referring to Asia\u2019s unmatched industrial infrastructure and labour scale.Some of Apple\u2019s suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, are expanding US operations under pressure. However, Foxconn appears unlikely to significantly boost its American footprint. The firm scaled back a highly publicized $10 billion Wisconsin plant and has instead committed $1.49 billion to its India operations.Likely bearing of 25% tariff on Apple\u2019s earningsUBS analyst David Vogt estimated that if a 25% tariff were applied to 70 million iPhones annually imported from China and India, Apple\u2019s earnings per share could take a hit of about $0.51. Wall Street currently expects Apple to earn $7.18 per share this fiscal year.As pressure mounts from Washington, Apple is left navigating a volatile mix of political demands, economic realities, and consumer expectations. Whether Trump\u2019s threat is a hard policy shift or a negotiation tactic, it has already forced a reckoning over the limits of globalization and the fragility of tech supply chains.",
    "shortDescription": "Apple is staring down a major supply chain and pricing dilemma after President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the United States unless the tech giant begins manufacturing the devices domestically.

    "descriptionText": "By Rolfe WinklerFor Tim Cook, the hits keep coming.On Friday, President Trump targeted Apple with new demands that the company make iPhones in the U.S., threatening 25% tariffs if the company doesn't comply. \"Rise and shine Tim Cook,\" Trump whisperer Laura Loomer posted on X, reminding the Apple CEO he is at the center of the president's trade bull's-eye.That is just one of the threats Cook has confronted in what has appeared to be a no good, very bad year for Apple. Aside from Trump, Cook is facing off against two U.S. judges, European and worldwide regulators, state and federal lawmakers, and even a creator of the iPhone, to say nothing of the cast of rivals outrunning Apple in artificial intelligence.Each is a threat to Apple's hefty profit margins, long the company's trademark and the reason investors drove its valuation above $3 trillion before any other company. Shareholders are still Cook's most important constituency. The stock's 25% fall from its peak shows their concern about whether he \u2014 or anyone \u2014 can navigate the choppy 2025 waters.What can be said for Apple is that the company is patient, and that has often paid off in the past.This past week, a key architect of the iPhone, Jony Ive, joined OpenAI to develop a next-generation device that weans consumers off screens. After he announced a deal to sell his startup io to OpenAI for $6.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported that a key goal is to deliver an AI-powered device that shifts the current computing paradigm in which humans stare at black rectangles all day. Later, OpenAI told employees it is aiming to make 100 million AI \"companion\" devices.It is hard to gauge the potential for a brand-new computing device from a company that has never made one. Yet the fact that it is coming from the man who led design of the iPhone and other hit Apple products means it can't be dismissed. Apple sees the threat coming: \"You may not need an iPhone 10 years from now, as crazy as that sounds,\" an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified in a court case this month.Apple isn't expected to show any AI breakthroughs at its annual developer conference in a couple of weeks. And Cook said on Apple's recent earnings call that a more personalized Siri assistant hasn't arrived yet because what the company has in the shop doesn't yet meet Apple's \"high quality bar.\"The company might not need to be first in AI. It didn't make the first music player, smartphone or tablet. It waited, and then conquered each market with the best. A question is whether a strategy that has been successful in devices will work for AI.Apple makes billions in revenue from its services business, carrying gross profit margins north of 70%, compared with less than 40% for hardware. A judge wrote in a recent ruling that Apple ignored her injunction to allow app developers to bypass its steep fees on app store purchases. \"Cook chose poorly\" in listening to advice to ignore her, she wrote.

These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash \u2014 the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. \"You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,\" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The \"real,\" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age \u2014 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later \u2014 and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. \"The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,\" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",

It is expected to create around 14,000 jobs and become one of the largest electronics-sector investments in the country.Foxconn disclosed the investment via a filing on the London Stock Exchange this week, noting that the funds will be routed through its Indian subsidiary, Yuzhan Technology India.Currently, Apple manufactures around 85% of its iPhones in China, with India accounting for roughly 15%. The company has been slowly increasing its Indian production share, partly to diversify its supply chain away from China amid rising geopolitical risks and to leverage India\u2019s more favourable trade ties with the United States.Escalation of frustrationTrump\u2019s threat follows a more measured statement he made last week on the same issueAt an event in Qatar last week, Trump revealed that he had directly confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company\u2019s growing operations in India, despite its pledge to invest $500 billion in the United States.\u201cI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI told him: \u2018Tim, you\u2019re my friend. You\u2019re coming here with $500 billion, but now you\u2019re building all over India. I don\u2019t want you building in India.\u201dHe accused Apple of taking advantage of preferential treatment in the US while concentrating its manufacturing overseas, especially in China. \u201cWe\u2019ve treated you really good,\u201d he said. \u201cNow you got to build for us.\u201dThe high costs of Apple\u2019s US manufacturingDespite political pressure, shifting iPhone assembly to the United States remains economically challenging. Industry analysts estimate that relocating production would cause labour costs to skyrocket\u2014from $290 per month per worker in India to about $2,900 under US wage laws. This would increase the cost of assembling each device from around $30 to $390.Such a move could slash Apple\u2019s profit per iPhone from $450 to just $60 unless the company raises its prices. Some estimates suggest that building the devices entirely in the US could push the retail price to nearly $3,000\u2014three times the current price point.This cost disparity has long been a key reason for Apple\u2019s international production strategy. While India offers relatively lower costs and improving infrastructure, bringing manufacturing stateside would be financially unsustainable without a significant increase in retail prices or a dramatic reduction in margins.",
    "shortDescription": "Apple\u2019s decision to expand its manufacturing footprint in India has triggered a sharp response from US President Donald Trump, who warned on Friday that iPhones sold in the United States must be made domestically\u2014or face heavy tariffs. The warning marks a new escalation in Trump\u2019s global tariff str\u2026",

    "descriptionText": "By Ben LevisohnOh, Donald.Just when the stock market was getting comfortable with your agenda again, you had to go and shake things up.There was your keyboard, so tempting, and you couldn't help posting new tariff threats on Apple and Europe, sparking a pre-Memorial Day slump. There was your \" big, beautiful bill,\" which finally passed the House of Representatives but spooked the Treasury market because it would increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion, including interest, over the coming decade. And don't forget the Supreme Court, which may or may not have given you the ability to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 index fell 2.6% this past week, its largest weekly loss since April 4.Still, it seems far too easy to blame the self-described Tariff Man for the stock market's bad week. It wasn't President Donald Trump who rushed in to buy so much stock that the S&P 500 rose 19.6% from its low on April 8 through May 8, erasing all its Liberation Day losses and then some. It wasn't Trump who pushed the S&P's relative strength index \u2014 a measure of market strength \u2014 to a level that suggested stocks had gotten overbought. And it wasn't Trump who forced investors to forget about tariffs and embrace the perceived power of deregulation, fiscal stimulus, and artificial intelligence to power the market higher.\"Just when you thought things couldn't get much better...they didn't,\" writes Frank Gretz of Wellington Shields.The blame falls on all of us, as we keep getting whipsawed by Trump's policies. And boy, have we been whipsawed. Ned Davis Research's DSI Global Sentiment Composite hit a low in April similar to the level reached at the bottom in 2022, but had surged 62 points in just 17 days, the fastest shift from bearish to bullish since the measure was begun in 2022.\"We can't predict the future tariff decisions to be made by an unpredictable president,\" writes Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis. \"And speculation should keep anxieties elevated and...herding upward or downward in response to the latest announcements.\"One group of investors hasn't been flip-flopping, however. That would be the short sellers betting against the market. The research team at S3 Partners notes short interest has increased since the start of the year \u2014 and continued to increase after April's early selloff. That suggests \"growing bearish sentiment despite market strength, or anticipation of a selloff,\" they write.If a selloff is going to come, it may be led by Big Tech. Just one week ago, investors were rushing back into AI stocks after Trump's visit to the Middle East, which featured a relaxation of rules to open those markets to U.S. tech companies. Now they're having second thoughts. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund dropped 2.5% this past week, led by Apple, which fell more than 7% after Trump threatened 25% tariffs on the iPhone.The group is still up about 17% since the April low, suggesting that there's still a lot of love about Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and the rest. Expecting the Mag Seven to save the day, however, may be wishful thinking. Stifel strategist Barry Bannister notes that Big Tech, despite its reputation for providing defensive secular growth, is far more cyclical than is realized. He expects sticky inflation and slowing wage growth to hurt consumer spending \u2014 and ultimately tech companies' sales. And a decline in the amount of money spent on AI could hit the fixed-investment component of gross domestic product, ending a five-year boom similar to what was seen during the second half of the 1990s.If Bannister is right, investors should use the recent strength to move into staples, healthcare, utilities, and what he dubs \"quality\" stocks. \"Big Tech is not 'defensive,' in our view, and is at risk in the 2H25 slowdown we expect,\" he writes.We're not suggesting anyone short the Mag Seven, or even the market. But we do think that investors should have the courage of their convictions, or at least their current portfolio construction. A high-volatility market is one that forces investors to consider both the possibility of big drops and gains. And it requires planning for multiple worst-case scenarios, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.That means having exposure to Treasuries, which have traditionally performed well in your run-of-the-mill recession; gold, for the possibility of stagflation; energy stocks, for a war in the Middle East; and even Bitcoin, in case of a run on the dollar. None is perfect, and they won't all make money at the same time.

    "descriptionText": "With Q1 results from Nvidia NVDA\u00a0less than a week away, the chip giant\u2019s stock has rebounded over +20% this month. The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let\u2019s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company\u2019s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia\u2019s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion.\u00a0Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4.\u00a0NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Meta Platforms \u2014 along with social-media companies X and Snap \u2014 also have played a role in the lobbying fight, advocating that what is known as \"age-gating\" should be the responsibility of app stores rather than individual apps.The Texas bill is turning heads because its success in the second-biggest state with a Republican legislature could foreshadow adoption across the country, potentially creating new costs for Apple and Google, as well as for some app makers.The law requires those running app stores, primarily Apple and Google, to verify the age of a device owner. If the owner is a minor, their app-store account would have to be tied to a parent's account. The parent would be notified when their child wants to download an app and have to approve or deny the download.Proponents argue that such laws will give parents more control over their children's use of smartphones, and that children aren't legally allowed to agree to apps' terms of service in the first place.Critics say such a law could impose costs on a swath of apps whose content isn't controversial. They also say the bills are allowing Meta and other apps to shunt responsibility for online safety onto others.One reason the laws are being crafted to have app stores verify ages, and not individual apps that are viewed as problematic, is that the latter approach would likely be struck down on free speech grounds, say those who have helped shepherd the bills.Meta has 13 lobbyists working in Texas, according to the state's Ethics Commission. Apple has six and Google has seven.An Apple spokesman said that the company wants to strengthen online safety for children but that the Texas bill threatens user privacy. \"If enacted, app marketplaces will be required to collect and keep sensitive personal identifying information for every Texan who wants to download an app, even if it's an app that simply provides weather updates or sports scores,\" he said.Meta has said that verifying ages at the app store-level is easier and helps preserve privacy, by only having children's ages stored in one place instead of on every app they access.A spokesman for Abbott said \"safety and online privacy for Texas children remains a priority for Governor Abbott. The Governor will thoughtfully review this legislation, as he does with any legislation sent to his desk.\"The age-verification bills are the latest threat to Apple's lucrative apps business. Last month, a judge forced the company to allow app developers to avoid Apple's steep commissions on app-store sales, a move the European Union is also pushing for.It is also the latest sign that Cook is playing a personal role lobbying for the company. When it comes to tariffs, he is known to call President Trump directly to advocate for the company's position. He was spotted visiting the White House on Tuesday. He also personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund.Apple lobbyists successfully blocked a similar effort in Louisiana last spring, but that bill has returned this year and is advancing.Some states are moving ahead with app-store bills anyway.\"The more we can help parents understand what their children are really interacting with and give them tools to help them make good parenting decisions, then I think we're all better off,\" said Angela Paxton, the Texas state senator who sponsored the legislation.Write to Rolfe Winkler at Rolfe.Winkler@wsj.com, Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at meghan.bobrowsky@wsj.com",

    "descriptionText": "By Gavin Bade, Meridith McGraw and Rolfe WinklerWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump fired new salvos in the global trade war on Friday, threatening a 50% tariff on imported goods from the European Union and new duties on iPhones and other smartphones made overseas.Trump said the EU had been \"very difficult to deal with\" on trade in a Friday morning social-media post. Less than a half hour earlier, he threatened Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, with a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones made overseas.\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.,\" the president wrote.Later on Friday, in Oval Office comments, Trump said those tariffs will include \"Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair.\" Trump appeared to be referring to companies that manufacture smartphones outside of the U.S. He added that the tariffs would likely be imposed in late June.The threats build on the president's effort to pressure CEOs to move more manufacturing to America and punish allies whose trade policies the White House argues are unfair. Cook met with Trump at the White House this week, according to a White House official.The White House didn't immediately provide additional comment. Apple declined to comment. An EU representative declined to comment. Apple shares declined 3% on Friday.Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU imports, which was later paused for 90 days to allow for negotiations. A 10% baseline levy remains, and some specific EU products, like cars, are subject to higher tariff rates.The U.S. president has long criticized European nations on trade, and he said in his Friday morning social-media post that trade discussions with the bloc had made little progress. \"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" he wrote. He said the 50% tariff would go into effect on June. 1.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he is \"not looking for a deal.\" Minutes later, he said the EU likely wants an agreement to avoid the tariffs, and added, \"We're going to see what happens, but right now it's going on on June 1.\" Trump listed Europe's nontariff barriers, regulations and lawsuits against U.S. firms as prime irritants driving his threat.European officials had expressed cautious optimism in recent days that talks were progressing after the two sides exchanged documents outlining some of the trade issues they are seeking to discuss. However, they acknowledged they remain far apart in their positions.The EU has been unwilling to move on some of Trump's demands, particularly the value-added tax, which the administration views as an unfair trade practice, but EU Economy Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said the tax is off the table in negotiations. This week, Dombrovskis needled the Trump team at a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting by saying their trade deals would be a \"suboptimal\" outcome for the global economy and suggesting that U.S. allies had to compromise with the U.S. on trade language in a joint statement.EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 ef\u010dovi\u010d spoke with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, hours after Trump's initial threat. In a social-media post after the call, he said the EU is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides, but added that trade between the U.S. and EU \"must be guided by mutual respect, not threats.\"\"We stand ready to defend our interests,\" he added.During the meeting of finance ministers in Canada this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told EU officials they have a \"collective action problem,\" warning that progress on reaching a trade deal with Europe had slowed because each nation has different priorities for an agreement, according to a U.S. official.Bessent on Friday hit out at Europe again, saying on Fox News that \"with the exception of the EU, most [nations] are negotiating in good faith.\"Last week, Trump chided Cook for Apple's plans to shift final assembly for many U.S.-bound devices to India, and he reiterated his demands that the company bring manufacturing back to America. He called the CEO his \"friend,\" but suggested that Apple's plan to invest some $500 billion in America wasn't enough.Bernard Arnault, CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, this week urged European lawmakers to take a more pragmatic, deal-focused approach to trade negotiations with the U.S.\"The United States is the No. 1 market in the world,\" Arnault told French senators during a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday. \"It's very important for Europe to reach an agreement with the United States. As of now, it seems to me things are off to a bad start.\"Arnault, who first met Trump when the two men were real-estate developers in New York in the 1980s, also warned against adopting a confrontational tone.\"If we threaten him \u2014 if we say, for example, 'We're coming in and we're going to take this or that measure,' or, 'We no longer want our companies to invest in the United States' \u2014 we'll get the opposite result,\" Arnault said.After Trump raised tariffs on goods made in China, Apple accelerated its effort to make most U.S.-bound iPhones in India. Such a move would allow it to claim India as the \"country of origin\" and pay the lower duties facing that nation.Bessent, in his Friday interview with Fox, said the administration is trying to persuade Apple to build semiconductors in the U.S.\"I think that one of our greatest vulnerabilities...is this external production, especially in semiconductors.

According to data from JPMorgan\u2019s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET\u2014the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index\u2019s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody\u2019s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities\u2014a new monthly record\u2014highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",

The S&P 500 index ended the week down 2.6%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite both fell 2.5%.\"I'm not so worried about the stock action,\" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management. \"A 2% to 3% drop is just normal trading compared to what investors have gotten used to in the last couple of months.\"More worrying is the steady rise in Treasury bond yields since Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. government and the House of Representatives passed a tax bill that could add to the country's large budget deficit.The 30-year Treasury bond yield finished the week at 5.036%, its highest level since 2023, while the 10-year yield ended the week at 4.508%, about the same as its high point during the worst of the market turmoil in April. Bond yields rise when prices fall. In contrast, the S&P 500 is still about 16% above its lowest point in April.Stock investors are relatively sanguine because \"they now know that Trump will pivot on trade,\" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, referring to the president's softer stance since late April. Stock prices would have dropped far more dramatically had Trump made his comments about Europe in March, he said. \"The market has finally figured out not to overreact to every salvo.\"Still, the fresh tariff threats from the White House are aimed at core pillars of global commerce: one of the world's most valuable companies and one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners. European stocks fell about 0.9% and investors sought shelter in haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, weighing on the dollar. Gold prices rallied.Senior U.S. and EU trade officials held a prearranged call on Friday, with neither side changing its position significantly in comments afterward. G-7 finance and central bank chiefs issued a vague statement Thursday that made no mention of levies, and only one mention of \"trade, \" after a summit that featured both Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and EU representation.On Apple, Trump said in a Friday post that he has told Apple CEO Tim Cook \"that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.\"Elevated Treasury bond yields indicate that traders are also worried that diminishing demand for U.S. government bonds will increase the country's borrowing costs. That would bring knock-on effects on large and small businesses by raising the cost of corporate loans and slowing economic activity.In another cause for concern, the value of the dollar is dropping even as bond-yields rise. That could indicate the U.S. currency is losing some of its appeal as a haven for foreign savers and corporations.Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com",

Since we have been through this before, he expects a more muted reaction this time.Below is a chart that shows how the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500's technology sector, fell by 6.2% in the first session following the S&P Global downgrade on Aug. 5, 2011. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down by 7.8% for the same session, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

U.S. officials fear the arrangement could expose sensitive data or bolster a Chinese firm's global ambitions, potentially derailing Apple's broader AI rollout.For Alibaba, this latest regulatory headwind comes amid a broader slowdown: revenue growth has decelerated as the company grapples with stiff competition from Xiaomi (XIACF), Huawei and a softening e-commerce environment. The stock's recent 15% drawdown from its year-to-date peak underscores investor unease around regulatory risk and execution challenges in its core markets.Why It Matters: A stalled AI partnership with Apple could delay Alibaba's push into high-margin services, while raising fresh doubts about U.S.China tech cooperation and Alibaba's near-term growth outlook.Analyst sentiment on Alibaba Group Holding is showing subtle strain. While the total number of ratings edged up to 44, the number of Underperform calls jumped to 7more than triple the previous months. At the same time, Buy ratings dipped to 14, their lowest in five months. This shift suggests growing caution despite a still-broad base of support.",

In March, Apple expanded its Mac portfolio with the new MacBook Air powered by the M4 chip with up to 18 hours of battery life and a new 12MP Center Stage camera. Apple also announced the new Mac Studio featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The new chip is the most powerful created by Apple and features double Neural Engine cores, Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2 times the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion.Apple\u2019s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in the first quarter of 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 8.7%, up 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 14.1% year over year to hit 5.5 million. According to Gartner, Mac shares inched up 20 bps while shipments increased 7% year over year.The availability of Apple Intelligence globally with macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India, bodes well for Mac\u2019s prospects.The Case for HP StockGrowing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP\u2019s PC sales. The company had earlier suggested that AI PCs could be a key growth driver beginning this year. It forecasted that 40-60% of all PCs will be AI PCs in the next three years. To make the most of the growing opportunities in this category, HP has launched several AI PCs this year and plans to continue to expand its AI PC portfolio.However, HP faces meaningful downside risk if the U.S.-China tariff war escalates. The company relies heavily on China for manufacturing and assembling many of its PCs, printers, and related components. Higher import tariffs on Chinese-made goods would raise HP\u2019s production costs, forcing the company to either absorb the margin pressure or pass on costs to consumers, both negative outcomes.Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.2%, up 20 bps on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of calendar 2025. Shipment grew 6.1% year over year to hit 12.8 million.HPQ & AAPL\u2019s Earnings Estimate Revision Goes SouthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ\u2019s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.39 per share, down 1.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 0.3% increase over fiscal 2025\u2019s reported figure.HP Inc. Price and ConsensusHP Inc. price-consensus-chart | HP Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for AAPL\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 5.48% growth over fiscal 2024.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. QuoteAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, HPQ\u2019s earnings lagged the consensus mark thrice while beating in the remaining one. Apple\u2019s average surprise of 4.68% is better than HP\u2019s average negative surprise of 1.16%.AAPL and HPQ Stock\u2019s Performance and ValuationYear to date, Apple shares have lost 17.1%, underperforming HP, shares of which have dropped 11.2%.AAPL and HPQ PerformanceHP shares are also cheaper compared with Apple. While HPQ has a Value Score of B, Apple has a Value Score of D, suggesting stretched valuation.\u00a0In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, HPQ shares are trading at 0.51X, lower than Apple\u2019s 7.60X.HPQ and AAPL ValuationConclusionApple\u2019s strong Mac portfolio, supported by the latest models, is positive for the iPhone maker\u2019s prospects. However, HP\u2019s reliance on China for PC manufacturing amid volatility in the relationship between the United States and China is a major headwind. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making the share a stronger pick against HP, which has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

The second is litigation with videogame developer Epic Games that threatens its ability to charge a fee on transactions in Apple's App Store.The payment from Google \u2014 estimated at $20 billion to $24 billion \u2014 is the bigger deal, representing around 6% of Apple's annual revenue but 16% of its earnings per share, according to Evercore's Amit Daryanani.Now the Department of Justice has proposed that Google should be prohibited from providing Apple with \"anything of value\" for search placement as part of an antitrust lawsuit against the search-engine company.\"We estimate 50% of the total payment from Google is for U.S. revenue sharing,\" wrote Daryanani. \"The DOJ would not be able to challenge the non-US payments.

Let's take a closer look at the benefits and the announcements of each.Benefits of Stock BuybacksStock buybacks, also known as share repurchase programs, are commonly deployed by companies to boost shareholder value.A stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves. Reducing the number of outstanding shares can boost earnings per share (EPS), also helping to put a floor under shares, reflective of consistent buying pressure.Still, it's worth mentioning that buybacks can sometimes bring out critics, as some believe the cash could be better deployed elsewhere, such as R&D. Nonetheless, buybacks are generally a net positive for shareholders, particularly those of mature companies with a much smaller growth runway.ANET Benefits from AIArista Networks' latest set of quarterly results beat our consensus EPS and sales estimates handily, with revenue of $2.0 billion showing nearly 30% growth year-over-year. The company's sales growth has been fueled by the AI frenzy, as the company is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus, and routing environments.The stock also sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with EPS expectations increasing across the board. Arista Networks unveiled an additional $1.5 billion repurchase program in the release.Apple Unveils Massive Stock BuybackDown 15% year-to-date, Apple shares have struggled in 2025, underperforming relative to the S&P 500 in a big way and driven lower by initial tariff headlines. Shares faced pressure as a result, but the recent de-escalation announcement between the US and China has brought back positivity.Apple unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting some of its cash to work. The earnings outlook for the tech titan remains under pressure, with analysts taking their EPS expectations lower across the board over recent months.The evolving EPS outlook of Apple is certainly going to be interesting, particularly so amid all the back-and-forth news we've received concerning tariffs and other economic developments. It's worth remembering that the company is no longer the growth machine it used to be, with EPS forecasted to climb 6% on 3% higher sales in its current fiscal year.AIT Generates Serious CashApplied Industrial Technologies exceeded both our consensus EPS and sales estimates, with EPS growing 4% YoY on the back of a 2% sales increase. The company's cash-generating abilities saw a notable boost throughout its latest period, with free cash flow of $115 million up 50% YoY.The cash-generating abilities have allowed the company to sport a shareholder-friendly nature, currently boasting a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. AIT unveiled a new repurchase program to buy up to 1.5 million shares, replacing the prior repurchase plan.Bottom LineCompanies commonly deploy repurchase programs to boost shareholder value, all of which we've recently seen from these companies listed above.All three have been aggressively buying shares over recent years, helping put in a floor while also aiding EPS. Though buybacks are criticized by some, they make great sense for mature companies with little growth left to squeeze.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",

Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

    "descriptionText": "NEW YORK CITY, NY / ACCESS Newswire / May 22, 2025 / Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC is investigating potential claims on behalf of purchasers of Apple Inc. (\"Apple\" or \"the Company\") NASDAQ:AAPL . Investors who purchased Apple securities are encouraged to obtain additional information and assist the investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.Investigation DetailsOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced that it was indefinitely delaying promised updates to its Siri digital assistant. Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025.What's Next?If you are aware of any facts relating to this investigation or purchased Apple securities, you can assist this investigation by visiting the firm's site: bgandg.com/AAPL.

    "descriptionText": "By Steven RosenbushSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. \u2014 The race to build useful artificial-intelligence agents that can perform complex actions for people is moving on to a new set of challenges.The large language models at the core of these agents are good enough for many tasks. But there is a growing emphasis on connecting the LLMs inside agents to a plethora of tools that they will need to get their jobs done.An advanced LLM might fail at complex multiplication, for example, while the cheapest, oldest model can ace the test if it has a calculator tool.But there is another hurdle: Agents will need permission to access apps, APIs and websites if they are ever going to call an Uber or book a flight, the kind of expectation that has been established over the past year.Humans type passwords or use facial and fingerprint recognition to sign into their accounts, but AI agents require new methods of authorization to address the intermediary role between humans and the services they want to use, according to Alex Salazar, chief executive of startup Arcade.dev.The promise of agentsIn a recorded presentation shown at Apple's developer conference last June, one of the company's machine-learning and AI leaders shared a hypothetical example in which she asked Siri to tell her when her mom's flight was going to land. Siri would cross-reference flight details that her mom emailed with real-time flight tracking to determine an up-to-date arrival time.Next, she imagined that she wanted Siri to tell her the details of lunch plans with her mom, which Siri would ascertain by checking her calendar or text messages. And it would figure out how long it would actually take to get to lunch from the airport.Apple has yet to deliver, but the AI ecosystem is working on the \"plumbing\" that will make such complex AI agents possible.The effort got a boost last November when Anthropic, the startup behind the chatbot Claude, introduced an open-source standard known as Model Context Protocol. \"Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools,\" the user guide says.\"Tool-calling agents are the emerging phase of agent AI development,\" Salazar told me. His 12-person startup on the outskirts of San Francisco is developing tools to tackle getting agents signed into websites, APIs and apps.The company, which Salazar co-founded last year with Chief Technology Officer Sam Partee, announced in March that it had raised $12 million of seed funding in a round led by Laude Ventures with participation by Flybridge Ventures, Hanabi Capital and the venture capitalist Andy Rachleff.Adoption curveGetting agents all the necessary tools and access is a significant obstacle.Device manufacturers will likely start integrating AI agents with core applications such as email and calendars, according to Salazar.

    "descriptionText": "The bond market is the older, wiser sibling of the stock market, and it doesn't often have a moment. But when it does, watch out.Investors were rattled Wednesday after an auction revealed weaker demand for 20-year Treasuries than expected. In other words, buyers are demanding higher returns to lend the government money, which reveals that they see those loans as riskier than before.The price of longer-term bonds has been falling more than shorter-term ones, suggesting that inflation may be faster in the future and that the Federal Reserve will have to keep interest rates higher in the future. The deficit-expanding budget bill making its way through Congress implies that the government will have to borrow even more money, which will increase supply faster than demand.The bond market has recent form in foiling President Donald Trump, playing a key role in his decision to pause tariffs for 90 days last month.The bigger problem is that U.S. government bonds are usually the safest investment possible. They don't look that safe anymore.That's the reason stocks fell back yesterday \u2014 because sentiment is contagious. Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a record high Wednesday and continued rising overnight, probably because two of the crypto bull arguments prevailed--even though they contradict each other. Crypto can be both a safe haven, and its sensitivity to risk sentiment means it can make big gains. Gold is also still trading close to record highs.But the market isn't panicking, it's just readjusting. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is higher than it was, but not too elevated by historical standards. Stocks are about flat on the year so far.It's normal for actions in parts of the market to reverberate to other asset classes. But bonds are the bedrock. When they cause a tremor, it can feel like an earthquake for stocks and Bitcoin.- Brian Swint***The Bond Rout Worsens, With U.S. 30-Year Yield Above 5%The bond market's May meltdown has taken a turn for the worse. Long U.S. bond yields pushed through the 5% ceiling on Wednesday, while Japanese bond yields briefly traded at record levels as their prices dropped. A disappointing 20-year U.S. Treasury auction exacerbated the situation.- The 30-year Treasury yield, at 5.089% reached a 52-week high and the highest level since October 2023. Bond yields move inverse to price, and it's the second time this week the 30-year has traded above 5%. That level has generally been the cap on the 30-year for about two decades. - Japan's government bonds have arguably fared worse. Its 30-year bond yield surged to 3.1872%, a record intraday level, according to data dating back to 2006. Yields on Japanese 40-year bonds also hit an intraday record. Long-dated U.K. government bond yields are at their highest levels since mid-April. - Structural issues and macroeconomic concerns are driving the U.S. bond rout. Price sensitive investors like hedge funds have dominated the market lately, subjecting government debt to bigger price moves. In Washington, the tax and spending bill could add $3.3 trillion in federal debt through 2034. - Tariffs are another pain point. They're widely expected to drag on U.S. economic growth. Normally, that would send yields lower as investors buy bonds in a flight to safety. But, a slower economy also has the potential to lower tax receipts, further stressing the deficit situation. What's Next: Revenue from companies paying the U.S. import tax was expected to only modestly offset this debt growth. No measurable progress on trade talks recently has heightened investors' jitters. The overall average tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to Yale's Budget Lab.- Karishma Vanjani***Bitcoin Notches New High as Crypto-Friendly Bills AdvanceBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, hit a new all-time high above $111,000 late Wednesday as various legislative efforts around digital assets continued to advance, including a Senate bill to regulate stablecoins and a Texas bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state, headed for the governor's signature.- Bitcoin reached $111,875 overnight, passing its previous record set on Inauguration Day, according to data from CoinDesk. Ether, the second biggest crypto, rose to $2,691, while the popular altcoin XRP climbed 4% to $2.44. - Stablecoins are cryptos pegged to a fiat currency, typically the U.S. dollar. The Senate legislation aims to regulate only stablecoins, not Bitcoin, but the bill's advancement toward a full floor vote nevertheless boosted overall sentiment for digital assets. - If approved by Senate lawmakers, the stablecoin bill would need to be reconciled with a version approved by the House Financial Services Committee before a final version is sent to the White House. - Texas is joining a growing movement embracing Bitcoin as an investment strategy. President Donald Trump has vowed to be crypto-friendly and has promoted the idea of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, funded with the Treasury's forfeited Bitcoin. What's Next: Crypto enthusiasts see the potential for wider acceptance of stablecoins and a bigger role for cryptocurrencies in the financial system, analysts told MarketWatch. If enacted, the Senate's Genius Act would be the first legislation in the U.S. regulating the roughly $250 billion stablecoin market.- Callum Keown and Janet H. Cho***OpenAI Is Bringing the iPhone Designer In-HouseOpenAI has been working with iPhone designer Jony Ive for two years, and now they are solidifying the tie-up with a $6.4 billion deal giving Ive and his team design and creative responsibilities at the artificial intelligence firm best-known for ChatGPT. The deal signals OpenAI is working on consumer devices.- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Ive's design firm, called io, would merge with OpenAI to work more closely with the research, engineering, and product teams in San Francisco. Ive left Apple in 2019 to found design firm LoveFrom, which has worked for Ferrari, Airbnb, and luxury Italian fashion firm Moncler. - Ive, a chief architect of the iPhone, and LoveFrom are taking over creative and design control at OpenAI, including collaborating on a closely-guarded device to move consumers beyond screens, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar. - As part of Wednesday's deal, OpenAI will acquire io in an all-equity transaction, and io's roughly 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists and product development specialists will become part of OpenAI. OpenAI acquired a 23% stake in io late last year, people told the Journal. - Apple investors have been looking for signs that its AI software, Apple Intelligence, can be an incentive for people to purchase devices such as the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops, and the iPad. But Apple AI's rollout has been slower than Wall Street would like. What's Next: OpenAI aspires to be a more consumer-centric company focused on mass-market products and impact. Altman recently hired Facebook and Instacart veteran Fidji Simo, an operations-focused executive, to help the company become a profitable and publicly traded company.- Angela Palumbo, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Janet H. Cho***AT&T Joins Verizon in Building Fiber Network Through M&ALumen's fiber optic broadband business was seen as a prize M&A target after Verizon Communications struck a deal to buy Frontier Communications last year. AT&T has emerged with that prize, announcing a $5.75 billion all-cash deal for Lumen's residential business, which includes one million customers in 11 states.- AT&T CEO John Stankey said it is increasing its buildout of the fiber broadband business and expects to roughly double where AT&T Fiber is available by the end of 2030, to about 60 million fiber locations. Lumen had been a speculated target of Verizon's, even after the Frontier deal. - Stankey said the Lumen business, which doesn't include its enterprise fiber business or its mass market copper cable business, will represent a \"significant investment\" in U.S. infrastructure. Metro areas covered include Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. - AT&T expects the deal to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory approval. Just last week, the Federal Communications Commission approved Verizon's $20 billion Frontier purchase after it agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. What's Next: AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 financial and operational guidance and said it is still committed to repurchasing shares under its previously announced $10 billion authorization, with plans to repurchase at least $3 billion by year-end and the remainder during 2026.- Janet H. Cho***Classes and final exams are wrapping up on college campuses, and 2025 graduates are preparing to enter an increasingly difficult labor market as questions linger about the future trajectory of the economy.Young people are also managing their finances in new ways. Generative artificial intelligence can take on the tedious task of budgeting, and the growing buy-now-pay-later industry grants the power to purchase almost anything in installments.MarketWatch spoke with money experts who offered advice on how to use the latest finance tools responsibly, and to remind graduates not to forget these tried and true personal finance habits.For more on this, read here.- Genna Contino***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert Steiner, Callum Keown This content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By Ian SalisburyShares of online car retailer Carvana rallied some 5% on Tuesday after CEO Ernie Garcia argued that tariffs could boost used-car sales. Analysts agree: They expect Carvana's operating profits to more than double in 2025 and jump another 25% in 2026.But Carvana's high share price, at 58 times expected 2025 earnings, already reflects that optimism and requires a lot to go right in uncertain times. Investors might do better with another stock with a much cheaper valuation: Group 1 Automotive, which rallied 1.2% to more than $448 on Tuesday after Citigroup's Michael Ward raised his target price to $495 from $463.Group 1 owns more than 330 auto franchises. Wall Street sees relatively modest profit growth: 3.8% in 2025, 6.6% in 2026. But shares trade at less than 11 times 2025 earnings. About 50% of Group 1's revenue comes from new-vehicle sales, compared with 33% for used vehicles, notes CFRA. If tariffs steer shoppers toward used cars instead of new ones, that could cut into Group 1's biggest market.Still, Ward notes, 25% of Group 1's revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where U.S. tariff plans mean little. He says its multiple could expand as memories of the Covid-era industry's dislocations fade. \"Dealer stocks are valued at a 15% discount to pre-Covid levels despite better-than-expected financial performance during and after the crises,\" he wrote, giving an opportunity for Group 1's double-digit revenue growth in 2025-26.Write to Ian Salisbury at ian.salisbury@barrons.comLast WeekMarketsThe U.S. and China cut tariffs for 90 days: U.S. on China goods to 30%, China on U.S. goods to 10%. Stocks, Treasury yields, and the dollar rose; gold fell. The Nasdaq surged 4%, the S&P 500 more than 3%. April inflation fell to 2.3%, and investors unwound Federal Reserve rate-cut trades. Stocks fell after UnitedHealth Group suspended guidance, the CEO quit, an old one returned, and The Wall Street Journal reported it was under investigation for Medicare fraud. Oil slipped on upbeat comments from President Trump on Iran talks. On the week, the Dow industrials rose 3.4%; the S&P 500, 5.3%; and the Nasdaq Composite, 7.2%. After the Friday close, Moody's downgraded U.S. credit over rising debt, ending its last triple-A rating.CompaniesTrump headed to the Middle East, eager for deals.

The move is OpenAI\u2019s most significant acquisition to date and signals a determined push into developing physical consumer devices powered by AI.The purchase gives OpenAI access not only to io\u2019s team of around 55 engineers and designers but also to the creative vision of Ive, the British-born designer behind Apple\u2019s most iconic products including the iPhone, iPod, and MacBook Air. The acquisition also formalises a relationship that has been in the making for nearly two years, as Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have quietly explored new device ideas together.\u201cI have a growing sense that everything I\u2019ve learned over the last 30 years has led me to this place and to this moment,\u201d Ive said in a joint interview with Altman.

The team, now under OpenAI\u2019s umbrella, will focus on building what Altman and Ive describe as \u201ca family of devices\u201d for the age of artificial general intelligence.The duo did not share specifics about the hardware under development but indicated that the first product would not simply be an iteration of the smartphone or laptop, but an entirely new computing form factor designed to complement AI\u2019s growing capabilities. \u201cPeople have an appetite for something new,\u201d Ive said, hinting at user fatigue with current devices.Altman added, \u201cAI is such a big leap forward in terms of what people can do that it needs a new kind of computing form factor to get the maximum potential out of it.\u201dThe first device from the collaboration is slated for release in 2026.Who is Jony Ive?Once described by Steve Jobs as his \u201cspiritual partner\u201d, Jony Ive\u2019s return to the heart of consumer technology marks a significant comeback for one of the most influential designers of the modern era. The British-born designer spent decades at Apple, where he worked closely with Steve Jobs to shape products that would define a generation, including the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Apple Watch. Ive left Apple in 2019 after a storied tenure, having played a central role in establishing the visual and tactile language of today\u2019s smartphones and personal devices.Sam Altman@sama\u00b7Followhttps://twitter.com/sama/status/1925242282523103408thrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.excited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.Watch on TwitterView replies10:58 pm \u00b7 21 May 2025https://help.twitter.com/en/twitter-for-websites-ads-info-and-privacy0ReplyCopy linkRead more on TwitterAt the time of his departure, Apple CEO Tim Cook suggested that Ive and the company would continue to collaborate, but no joint products ever materialized.

    "descriptionText": "Wednesday, May 21, 2025A couple things happened mid-day that sent a steady flat-to-down session falling into the red and staying there. Market indexes closed off their lows, but appeared to be trending back down in the final minutes before the close. The Dow slip -816 points, -1.91%, the S&P 500 -95, -1.61%, the Nasdaq -270, -1.41% and the small-cap Russell 2000 -55 points, -2.63%.One occurrence was a sell-off in bonds, likely having something to do with the U.S. government planning to add to the overall deficit with a major tax cut bill working its way through Congress. The three credit rating agencies have already downgraded the U.S. from AAA, and now this bond option has led to spiking Treasury yields: +4.59% on the 10-year, +4.01% on the 2-year, and back up over +5% on the 30-year bond.The other event was more localized in the realm of AI and concerning the original designer of the iPhone, Jony Ive. Ive\u2019s AI startup io is going to Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI for a cool $6.4 billion, and without many details the market priced in a discount at Apple AAPL, which closed -2.3% on the day. What this move signals in a broader sense, however, is that access to AI design and implementation is becoming increasingly competitive.Q1 Earnings After the Close: URBN, SNOW, ZMUrban Outfitters URBN posted solid beats on its Q1 report after today\u2019s closing bell, with earnings of $1.16 per share easily outperforming the 81 cents expected. Revenues of $1.33 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks consensus of $1.29 billion. Comps rose +4.8% year over year, led by Anthropologie. Company subscribers rose by nearly +60%. The retailer made no mention of tariff impacts on future gains. Shares are up +9% after hours. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here.)Data storage firm Snowflake SNOW also outpaced estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with earnings of 24 cents per share beating expectations by 2 cents on quarterly sales of $1.04 billion, which improved over the $1.00 billion analysts were anticipating. Product revenue guidance was placed much higher for Q2: $997 million versus $962 million previously expected. Shares gained +7% on the news in late trading.Zoom Communications ZM makes it 3-for-3 following Wednesday\u2019s close: earnings of $1.43 per share \u201czoomed\u201d past the Zacks consensus $1.30, with revenues eking out a slight beat: $1.17 billion versus $1.16 billion. Earnings guidance was lifted while revenues were kept in-line, as gains in Enterprise outperformed estimates. The videoconferencing services firm had jumped higher on the news, but have moderated somewhat.What to Expect from the Stock Market ThursdayFinally, tomorrow morning we see some economic reportage, including Weekly Jobless Claims, S&P flash Services and Manufacturing PMI, and Existing Home Sales. Expectations are for jobless claims to remain steady at the slightly higher levels we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks, lower PMI results with Services remaining above the 50 threshold but Manufacturing dipping below it, and home sales coming in slightly higher month over month.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

    "descriptionText": "By Joseph Adinolfi and Joy WiltermuthWorries about rising bond yields are coming home to roost, sending the Dow down 800 pointsInvestors have been warily eyeing rising Treasury yields since the start of May, with some fretting that the latest jump in borrowing costs could soon start hurting stocks.Those fears were realized on Wednesday, as a disappointing auction of 20-year Treasury bonds sent yields climbing to fresh highs. Borrowing costs tied to long-dated debt touched levels not seen since late 2023.That sent stocks reeling, with major indexes tallying their worst session since April 21, Dow Jones Market Data showed.\"Looks like we are sinking,\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said after the weak 20-year bond auction.The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was knocking on the door of the 4.6% level, and concerns about tariffs and \"the battle of the budget\" remain, he said.Republicans are working to pass President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" budget bill. The latest version of the legislation included tax and spending cuts but would do little to pare the U.S. budget deficit.\"When you have yields jumping up like this, it's a tough crosscurrent for stocks,\" Cardillo said.Stocks had shaken off some of their early losses heading into the afternoon, as gains for Big Tech names like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into the green.But around 1 p.m., the market suffered a one-two punch. Reports that OpenAI would buy an artificial-intelligence company founded by former Apple Inc. (AAPL) design chief Jony Ive appeared to weigh on shares of Ive's former employer.Around the same time, the weak 20-year BX:TMUBMUSD20Y auction helped revive concerns about waning foreign demand for U.S. debt. Suddenly, investors were starting to question how the U.S. would manage its debt burden over the long term.This, combined with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy, was enough to weigh on stocks, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Chicago-based Zacks Investment Management.See: Why the next 20-year Treasury auction is 'must-see TV' for investors after the Moody's downgrade\"It's a question of how much growth are we going to get, and what is the revenue stream for the U.S. government looking like to support the debt that they're issuing,\" he said.Mulberry also pointed out that pain in debt markets was a global phenomenon on Wednesday, as yields on bonds trading in Japan and Europe also spiked.Earlier, investors digested weak earnings from Target Corp. (TGT), along with a report from fellow retailer TJX Cos. (TJX), the parent of TJ Maxx, which Mulberry described as not as bad as Target's, but still not great. Shares of both companies were selling off.Meanwhile, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) fell further, heaping more pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was also weakening, signaling that the \"Sell America\" trade might be back on, at least for now. Meanwhile, gold (GC00) and bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed, with the latter hitting a fresh record high north of $109,000 per coin.The S&P 500 SPX finished 95.85 points, or 1.6%, lower at 5,844.61, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP was off by 270.07 points, or 1.4%, at 18,872.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 816.80 points, or 1.9%, to 41,860.44.-Joseph Adinolfi -Joy WiltermuthThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The all-stock deal to acquire artificial intelligence device-maker io includes OpenAI's current stake in the company.In a statement alongside Ive, CEO Sam Altman said io would merge with OpenAI \"to work more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco,\" while Ive and LoveFrom, his so-called creative collective, would assume \"design and creative responsibilities.\"In a video posted to OpenAI's website, Altman said the acquisition was based on the mission of figuring out how to create a family of devices that would allow people to use AI \"to create all sorts of wonderful things.\"Any products from the merged companies may still be a while off. The video signs off with a slide that says: \"We look forward to sharing our work next year.\"Apple stock was down about 2% on the news. That company has its own family of devices, including the iPhone, Apple Watch, laptops and the iPad. Investors have been looking for signs from the tech giant that its own AI software, Apple Intelligence, can incentivize people to purchase its products. But the rollout of this software has been slower than Wall Street would like.The merger between io and OpenAI, with the promise to make a \"family of devices,\" powered by AI, seems to have made Apple investors even more wary.Barron's has reached out to Apple for comment.In an attempt to broaden its AI reach, Apple teamed up with OpenAI in 2024 to integrate ChatGPT capabilities into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively.Write to Angela Palumbo at angela.palumbo@dowjones.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "By George Glover and Reshma KapadiaPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would impose a 50% tariff on the European Union starting June 1 and threatened 25% tariffs on Apple iPhones if they weren't made in the U.S., reminding the market that the trade war is still very much on.Trump announced the levies in a post on Truth Social, citing the EU's \"powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies.\"He said that he was \"recommending a straight 50% tariff\" on the trading bloc, to take effect June 1. The duties won't apply to any products that are manufactured in the U.S., Trump added.Europe's flagship Stoxx 600 index plummeted after Trump said he would impose the levies. It was down 1.8% at last check. Paris's CAC 40 tumbled 2.8% and Frankfurt's Dax dropped 2.3%. U.S. stocks also fell.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and the European Commissioner For Trade Maro\u0161 ef\u010dovi\u010d are set to speak on a call later on Friday. The European Commission's spokesperson on trade declined to respond to a Barron's request for comment about Trump's Truth Social post.The latest threats come as trade talks have dragged out on multiple fronts and analysts like Owen Tedford at Beacon Policy Advisors has worried that Trump could look to make an example of a token country to pressure other priority countries to commit to some sort of framework agreement faster.\"The EU is particularly problematic for the Trump administration because they are not caving to pressure,\" says Henrietta Treyz, head of research at political consultancy Veda Partners. The two sides aren't closer to a resolution on longstanding issues, including standards for agriculture and commodity purchases and a digital services tax.The escalation is similar to the approach the administration tried with China and then walked back with its recent pause. \"He has created an untenable tariff that effectively bans trade between the two nations,\" says Treyz, who expects tariffs on EU to rise, probably to 20% to 30%. \"By threatening 50% today, should he land at 20% or even 30%, it's possible the market sees that as 'de-escalation' and doesn't respond as negatively to the shock.\"\"Dialing tariffs up or down is one way the administration believes it can bring forth change in global supply chains and trade,\" says Juhi Dhawan, a macro strategist for Wellington Management via email, who expects the tariffs to be a tool used throughout the Trump presidency.The takeaway for investors: The relative calm around trade may have been misplaced.

The company increased adjusted earnings to $20.07 to $20.12 per share from the previous guidance of $19.16 to $19.36 per share.This was above the analyst\u2019s expectation of $19.40 per share. Nuclear stocks bucked the trend after a Reuters report claimed that Trump would soon sign orders that would benefit the nuclear energy sector.This includes faster approvals for new reactors and strengthening fuel supply chains.Oklo shares rallied 24% while Nuscale gained 16%. Constellation Energy Tariffs back on the menuTrump brought back the tariff talks on Friday.\u00a0He threatened Apple with 25% tariffs for every iPhone made outside and sold in the US.\u00a0In a Truth Social post, Trump said Apple needs to manufacture iPhones in the US if they want to sell them in the US.\u00a0This marks the first instance where Trump is threatening a single company over tariffs.The US president wasn\u2019t done, as he also said that the US would put a 50% tariff on the EU from June 1.According to Trump, the EU \u201chas been difficult to deal with,\u201d and the trade negotiations have been going nowhere.\u00a0Along with the US markets, European markets also slipped after Trump\u2019s tariff announcements.\u00a0European stocks fell sharply, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index down 1.9%. Germany\u2019s DAX dropped 2.3%, France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 2.8%, and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 lost 1.3%.Meltdown in the bond marketThe US 30-year bond yield had spiked over 5.1% earlier in the week. The bond market was spooked after concerns over spiralling US debt, as Moody\u2019s downgraded US sovereign debt along with a new tax bill from the US government, which is expected to add more to the debt.Trump\u2019s tax bill was passed narrowly in the House of Representatives on Thursday by a 215-214 vote. The bill will now undergo debate in the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are already pushing for important changes.The bill is expected to add $4 trillion to the US debt.The tax plan is drafting cuts on Medicaid and food stamps, which have concerned lawmakers expressing concerns over reducing programs that help low-income Americans.The cuts are expected to further dent consumer sentiment as income inequality is expected to increase.",

Total sales grew 5% year-over-year throughout the above-mentioned period, with adjusted EPS of $1.65 up 8% from the same period last year.The company\u2019s stellar cash-generating abilities have allowed it to reward shareholders nicely, with the tech titan announcing a 4% boost to its quarterly dividend payout. Apple also unveiled a massive $100 billion additional repurchase program in its latest quarterly report, putting even more of its cash to work.The tech titan generated $20.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.Due to its heavy manufacturing exposure in China, the recent de-escalation of trade tensions is a massive positive. Apple previously warned it may pass the higher costs onto consumers through iPhone price hikes, so the recent news is excellent for both parties.Shares jumped on the news, gaining nearly 20% since the announcement.Vistra Increases Payout AgainVistra safely operates a reliable, efficient, power generation fleet of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities. Shares have been scorching hot over the last year, gaining nearly 70% thanks to demand stemming from the AI infrastructure buildout.The company announced a 3% increase to its quarterly payout, continuing a trend of higher payouts over the years. VST presently sports a 13% five-year annualized dividend growth rate, with its payout ratio sitting sustainably at 12% of its earnings. Below is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s dividends paid on a quarterly basis.Importantly, Vistra reaffirmed its current year guidance in its latest release in early May, providing a big sigh of relief to investors. The Q1 earnings cycle has largely been dictated by commentary for the upcoming periods, and VST cleared the critical hurdle.Bottom LineDividends bring many great perks to investors, such as passive income and the ability to achieve maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.Companies typically boost payouts when business is running smoothly, overall sending a positive message concerning the longer-term picture as well. In addition, consistently higher payouts owe to a company\u2019s cash-generating abilities, undoubtedly a huge positive.And for those seeking companies looking to pay their shareholders a higher paycheck, both companies above \u2013 Apple AAPL and Vistra VST \u2013 fit the criteria.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

In a fiery Truth Social post on Friday, the former U.S. President warned that if iPhones sold in America aren't made on American soil, Apple could be hit with a 25% tariff. Trump claimed he had already told Tim Cook to stop shifting production to India and \"anyplace else,\" suggesting a potential policy reversal if he's reelected.Investors didn't take it lightly. Apple stock sank 3.4% in the premarket trading at 7.49am, dragging Nasdaq (QQQ) futures into the red. The sell-off highlights just how sensitive markets remain to tariff talk especially when it comes to tech giants with deep global supply chains. Despite Apple's multi-billion-dollar U.S. investment pledges, the company still relies heavily on China and has recently ramped up iPhone manufacturing in India a strategic hedge that now faces political headwinds.Apple hasn't commented yet, but the message from Trump is loud and clear: bring jobs back or pay the price. A 25% tariff would hit Apple's margins or force it to pass costs to consumers neither of which would sit well with shareholders. For now, this is just talk. But with the 2024 race heating up and reshoring back in the spotlight, Apple investors may want to start scenario planning.",

Specifically, Apple said that certain features initially announced in June 2024, including Siri's ability to tap into a user's personal information to answer queries and have more precise control over apps, will now be released sometime in \"the coming year.\" On this news, Apple's stock price fell $11.59 per share, or 4.85%, to close at $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025. Then, on March 12, 2025, Morgan Stanley published a report in which analyst Erik Woodring lowered his price target on Apple from $275 to $252, asserting that the delay in introducing advanced Siri features would impact iPhone upgrade cycles throughout 2025 and 2026. Woodring presented evidence that roughly 50% of iPhone owners who did not upgrade to the iPhone 16 attributed their decision to such delays. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped $11.16 per share, or 5.05%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $209.68 per share on March 13, 2025."

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Alphabet GOOGL.Here are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:Apple's CarPlay Ultra Gains Adoption: Buy or Hold AAPL Stock?Apple next-generation infotainment system CarPlay Ultra is now available with new Aston Martin models in the U.S. and Canada. The latest system will be available for existing vehicles with a software update. CarPlay Ultra is also expected to be available with new models from Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global infotainment industry is expected to see a CAGR of 7.2% between 2025 and 2032 to hit $58.18 billion by 2032. CarPlay, along with Android Auto, has been the most popular choice of automakers. The latest CarPlay Ultra offers information for all of the driver's screens, including maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure.Apple is continuously upgrading features of its service offerings that revolve around the iPhone. The company recently introduced an update to Apple Maps that helps users search and discover top-ranked restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more, with the addition of rankings and insights from expert sources.Nevertheless, Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone, particularly in China, due to stiff competition from Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. China sales decreased 2.3% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. iPhone sales increased 1.9% year over year to $46.84 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in regions where Apple Intelligence was available.Apple shares have dropped 16.6% year to date (YTD), underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology as well as its closest peers, including Dell Technologies , HP and Alphabet . YTD, shares of Dell Technologies, HP and Alphabet dropped 0.8%, 10.8% and 12%, respectively.Apple Intelligence Expansion to Boost Apple's Sales GrowthApple expanded availability of Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 updates in new languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified) \u2014 as well as localized English for Singapore and India \u2014 and are accessible in nearly all regions around the world. Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features while expanding to more countries in December 2024.The availability of Apple Intelligence boosts the capabilities of Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and be more productive. For iPad, Apple Intelligence offers features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions and the Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Apple's vision OS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users.Can Strong Services Boost Apple's Prospects?Although Apple's business primarily revolves around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company's strong growth driver. In the fiscal second quarter, Services revenues grew 11.6% year over year, and Apple expects the March-end quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to increase by low double digits on a year-over-year basis.Apple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.

The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.AAPL Estimates Show Downward TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple's fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 0.8% to $7.12 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.48% growth from the figure reported in fiscal 2024.Apple's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 4.68%.Apple Shares OvervaluedThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.Apple is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.89X compared with the sector's 25.5X, Alphabet's 17.06X, Dell Technologies' 12.41X and HP's 8.26X, reflecting a stretched valuation.AAPL shares are now trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.Apple Stock: Buy or Hold?Apple suffers from stiff competition in China and higher tariffs that are expected to increase costs by $900 million. Hence, we believe that Apple's near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation.

    "descriptionText": "By Britney NguyenPresident Donald Trump said Apple must pay a 25% tariff if it doesn't rely on domestic production of iPhones for the U.S. marketShares of Apple Inc. were down more than 2% shortly after Friday's open after President Donald Trump threatened the company with a tariff if it doesn't make iPhones for the U.S. market stateside. One analyst called Trump's dream of domestic iPhone production a \"fairy tale.\"\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple (AAPL) that I expect their [iPhones] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.\"However, analysts at Evercore ISI said in April they didn't see iPhone production moving into the U.S., \"as the higher labor costs alone would drive a >50% increase in iPhone manufacturing costs\" - double the tariff Trump is now threatening to put on Apple.\"This implies that even under a 50% global baseline tariff it would not make financial sense to produce the iPhone domestically,\" Evercore said last month.Earlier this month, the president said he \"had a little problem\" with the Apple chief during a meeting between the two in Qatar. Trump has taken issue with the iPhone maker's further expansion into India. Apple doesn't produce any smartphones in the U.S., but has been diversifying its supply chain away from China since pandemic-era lockdowns and as geopolitical tensions between the two countries have intensified. The company has moved production into countries including India and Vietnam, but the Trump administration is still pushing for the company to bring its manufacturing stateside.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.As Trump floated massive tariffs on goods imported from China earlier this year, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, pointed out that most of the components used in iPhones are made abroad.\"If U.S. tech companies are faced with this reality, it will negatively change the tech landscape for decades to come,\" Ives said in an April note.
