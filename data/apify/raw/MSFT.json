    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns.

The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily in AI, the combined spending of Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0is slated to be over $300 billion in 2025, with total corporate investment on AI expected to be over $500 billion in the U.S. alone.That said, let\u2019s see if the rally in NVDA can continue with Nvidia set to release its Q1 report on Wednesday, May 28.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s AI Expansion & Spending Enhancing productivity and efficiency, the AI boom has made it a very relevant time to consider big tech stocks as their ultra-growth prospects have a steroid-like catalyst. On the other hand, there are concerns that increased spending on AI could weigh down shareholder returns, especially if the wave fizzles out or an economic downturn occurs.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts the company\u2019s AI-related investments will grow by over 300% in the next three years as it focuses on ramping up its Blackwell GPU production, the most sought-after and highest-performing AI chips on the market. Coinciding with this, Nvidia\u2019s capital expenditures have spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion.\u00a0Nvidia also has a significant stake in cloud computing and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave CRWV, owning 24.18 million CRWV shares in its latest 13F filing. At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4.\u00a0NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL \u2013 May 23, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Salesforce CRM and Microsoft MSFT.Buy This Megacap Tech Stock Down -2% Ahead of Earnings?Salesforce stock has lagged solidly behind the Tech sector over the past five years. Wall Street is worried about CRM's slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28.The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service.CRM's growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond. Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce's offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over\u2014its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce's transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM's Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce's new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program \"agents\" for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development.Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said \"nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,\" and all of its \"top 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.\"The company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, \"achieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation.\" The goal is to infuse generative AI across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce's AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce's earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The tech company's EPS estimates have remained largely unchanged over the past year as well.CRM is projected to grow its EPS by 9% this year and 11% next year, following 24% growth last year. The company has topped our EPS estimate in 19 out of the past 20 quarters.CRM is projected to grow its revenue by 8% and 9%, respectively, adding $6.5 billion to the top line between FY25 and FY27.Time to Buy the Tech Giant on the Dip?CRM has skyrocketed 5,500% during the past two decades, blowing away MSFT's 1,700% and Tech's 720%.Salesforce has jumped 280% in the last 10 years, roughly matching the Tech sector's 290%, but falling miles behind Microsoft's 860%.The more mundane performance is fueled by its 60% gain in the past five years, lagging Tech's 115% and Microsoft's 150%.CRM stock is down 16% YTD vs. Tech's 2% dip. The recent underperformance provides investors a chance to buy Salesforce stock 25% below its average Zacks price target and 20% below its December record.The stock recently got rejected by its 200-day moving average. Yet, it remains above its 50-week moving average as it attempts to hold its ground at its 2020 breakout levels, while trading at neutral RSI levels.Salesforce's improved earnings outlook has it trading at a 75% discount to its 10-year median at 33X forward 12-month earnings and in line with its industry.CRM's PEG ratio, which factors in its longer-term earnings growth outlook, sits at 2.6, marking an 85% discount to its 10-year highs and only a slight premium to its industry.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

    "descriptionText": "IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company\u2019s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power.

    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash \u2014 the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. \"You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,\" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The \"real,\" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age \u2014 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later \u2014 and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. \"The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,\" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",

Bottom LineFor now, Intuit stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) following its favorable Q3 report. That said, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if a buy rating is on the way as earnings estimate revisions could trend higher in the coming weeks, considering Intuit\u2019s elevated revenue guidance.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

At the same time, Nvidia has recently announced multi-billion-dollar agreements outside of the U.S. and China, as the chip supplier to Saudi Arabia\u2019s new AI venture, Humain.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Growth ExpectationsBased on Zacks' estimates, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales are thought to have increased 64% to $42.64 billion compared to $26.04 billion a year ago. On the bottom line, Q1 EPS is expected to rise 39% to $0.85 versus $0.61 a share in the prior period. Sequentially, Nvidia\u2019s Q1 sales would mark 8% growth but a 4% decline from earnings of $0.89 a share in Q4.\u00a0NVDA Technical Analysis Regarding Nvidia\u2019s latest rally, NVDA continued a bullish ascension after retaking its previous 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $111 a share in early May and then surged past its former 200-day SMA of $125.Technical traders will be looking for NVDA to remain above its 200-day SMA, which is currently at $126 a share (Red Line). However, a post-earnings selloff that extends below the current 50-day SMA (Green Line) of $114 would signal a bearish downturn with NVDA soaring from a recent 52-week low of $86 a share in early April. \u00a0Monitoring Nvidia\u2019s P/E Valuation At current levels, Nvidia stock trades at 30.9X forward earnings, which is not an overly stretched premium to the benchmark S&P 500\u2019s 22.5X. Notably, NVDA is at the middle of the Mag 7 in terms of P/E valuation, offering a discount to Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla TSLA\u00a0but being above Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, and Meta. Seeing as Nvidia stock has been in a league of its own in terms of market gains of over +1,300% in the last five years, it\u2019s noteworthy that NVDA trades well below its high of 122.1X forward earnings during this period and is nicely beneath its median of 55X. \u00a0Bottom Line Ahead of its Q1 report next week, Nvidia stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). After such a sharp rally over the last month, there could be better buying opportunities ahead as investors will be closely assessing Nvidia\u2019s CapEx spend and guidance, with the chip giant\u2019s mind-boggling sequential growth starting to fade.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

The rebound has outperformed the broader indexes and led the Mag 7, with most of Nvidia\u2019s big tech peers utilizing the company\u2019s custom chips for their AI endeavors.Investing heavily i\u2026",

    "descriptionText": "Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works \u2014 camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI \u2014 as an alternative portal to the web \u2014 is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem \u2014 how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the \"AI Ultra\" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was \"not budging,\" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - \"We're in center position,\" Daly said. \"My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in.\" - \"I am a person of action,\" Hammack said. \"But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands.\" Bostic was more definitive. \"I don't have a recession in my outlook,\" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. \"I think I've done enough,\" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has \"already turned around,\" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said \"I did what needed to be done.\"- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to \"hang tight and hold out\" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help.

GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, \"fix the build error on apple platforms,\" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. \"How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?\" one developer asked on GitHub.\"We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,\" another developer on GitHub said. \"Is the ROI even worth it?\"The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: \"We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.\"As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.\"By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,\" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. \"We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.\"Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The return of around -1.3%, in fact, matched the \"humiliating place stock returns were\" during the market's trough in February 2009, during the global financial crisis, the bank said.Sharp-eyed readers will note, of course, that stocks bottomed out the following month and embarked on the longest bull run in financial market history, with the S&P 500 delivering annualized returns of 17.8% for each of the next 10 years.U.S. Treasuries might not be ready for that kind of roaring gain. But after Moody's stripped the government of its coveted AAA-status last week and 30-year bond yields topped 5.15% earlier this week, the highest since 2007, investors are starting to see value.Around $25 billion in new money found its way into bond portfolios in the latest week, BofA's flow report indicated, outpacing the $16 billion moved into cash. Stock funds, meanwhile, suffered their first outflows in two months, losing $4.1 billion even as the S&P 500 rallied to within 3% of its all time high.Oscar Wilde once noted that a cynic is the sort of person that knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. As Treasuries sold off this week, there appeared to be plenty of cynics focused on the government bonds' levels and the impact of U.S. fiscal profligacy, discounting the value in the trade as a result.Long-dated yields are moving lower in early Friday trading, and could rally even further next week if minutes from the Federal Reserve's May policy meeting hint another rate cut or a tamer-than-expected reading of the April's personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, inflation gauge.\"[There is] nothing more contrarian in 2025 than being long the long-end, \" BofA writes. \"And while the 2020s spending of Biden's Build Back Better + taxation of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill don't a AAA-rating make, we say return of bond vigilantes to (the 5% level on 30-year Treasury yields) is a cyclical buy opportunity.\"Write to editors@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

The agency cited a May 7 ruling by the Ninth Circuit, which upheld a lower court's decision denying the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction against the transaction. The FTC said it determined that continuing administrative litigation would not serve the public interest. The dismissal effectively ends the Commission's efforts to unwind Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of the game publisher behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, it said. The case is now closed, with no further action expected from the agency, the FTC said. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.",

    "descriptionText": "US stocks eased on Tuesday as investors took a breather following a robust multi-week rally. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, pressured by weakness in technology stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered just under the flatline in choppy trade.Technology led the market lower, with the sector down nearly 0.9%. Shares of Nvidia fell 1%, and other tech heavyweights, including Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, also registered declines. The pullback in tech weighed on the broader market, pausing the momentum from recent sessions.Home Depot bucked the trend, rising 2% after affirming its full-year guidance. The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500\u2019s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody\u2019s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors \u201cbuy the dip\u201dRetail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody\u2019s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan\u2019s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET\u2014the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index\u2019s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody\u2019s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities\u2014a new monthly record\u2014highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back \u2014 and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. \"The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,\" Ive said in the merger announcement video.\"Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'\" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. \"Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.\"The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An \"AI device\" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, \"you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.\"So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it \"The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now.\" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens. But screens are sticky for a reason: Users can scroll quickly through their emails, texts, and Amazon cart. They immediately offer videos of a child's latest high jinks. And they show off TikTok and Instagram to their fullest.Without a screen, Altman and Ive's product needs a different user interface. It will have to be non-graphical, like voice on smart glasses and the failed AI Pin. There's the possibility Altman and Ive come up with something else entirely, but, for now, no one knows. Altman and Ive's video concludes by saying \"We look forward to sharing our work next year.\"Work, of course, isn't necessarily a product and, by then, the AI landscape may be completely different.Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT -backed Builder.ai collapsed followed an internal inquiry, which found that the company's former executives allegedly reported \"bogus\" sales to the board, The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing people close to the matter. The provisional accounts submitted by the technology startup to its auditor showed that the company revised its 2024 revenue estimates to about $55 million from a previously reported estimate of $220 million. It also reduced its previously reported 2023 total sales revenue of $180 million to about $45 million, the report said, citing the people. The prior revenue figures were submitted to the board when founder Sachin Dev Duggal was CEO, the report said. Duggal resigned as CEO along with Builder.ai's Chief Revenue Officer Varghese Cherian in early 2025, according to the report. The people familiar with the matter said that sales, which were previously booked, remained outstanding for an extended period of time due to Duggal's departure, raising concerns regarding revenue recognition. This eventually led to hiring of a law firm by the board to investigate the matter. The law firm shared its findings, which showed that there may have been a coordinated effort to inflate revenue at the company, the report said. Builder.ai said Tuesday it would enter insolvency proceedings and appoint an administrator to oversee the company's affairs. Builder.ai didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.",

The month that followed was volatile for the sector.The chart below shows how the fund and index reacted to Fitch's U.S. credit downgrade on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2023. The Technology Sector SPDR fell 2.3% the following day and was down about 4% by the end of the week. The Nasdaq fell by 2.6%, the following day and was off 3% by the end of the week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The month following was also volatile for the sector.Moody's downgrade last week wasn't a huge surprise, said Monchau. The firm had lowered its U.S. sovereign-credit rating outlook from stable to negative in November 2023, so this move was to be expected. Still, the market reacted swiftly as stocks opened lower on Monday morning with the S&P 500 down by 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.4%, before both indexes erased their losses and closed up on the day. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund fell 0.8% on Monday morning but pared most of its losses.Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year had an intraday high of 4.57% on Monday and the 30-year spiked above 5%, before settling back down near 4.45% and 4.91% respectively.The rising bonds yields are what pose a bigger risk to tech stocks, mainly because higher returns on government bonds increase their relative appeal versus stocks. Despite a less favorable U.S. credit rating, government bonds still pose less risk than stocks, hence why they are used as the risk-free rate that's benchmarked against other assets. Simply put, investors increasingly choose lower-risk government bond yields of 4.5% to 5% over choppy growth stocks with outlooks far into the future.However, tech stocks have a bit of wind in their sails this time thanks to the excitement around artificial intelligence. Hyperscalers are still planning on big spending when it comes to AI-infrastructure development. Meanwhile, five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, including Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and Microsoft Crop. (MSFT), had solid first-quarter earnings, and Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) results are on deck next week.Although many of the big tech companies largely gave vague guidance, investors seem a bit more comforted after President Donald Trump announced a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China.Big Tech hasn't erased its 2025 losses. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS is still down by about 3.5% this year. But in a May 16 note, analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the seven stocks collectively to still outperform the rest of the market, based their earnings-growth expectations, though by a smaller margin than they have over the past couple of years.-Laila MaidanThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Wall Street is worried\u00a0about CRM\u2019s slowing growth and the possible negative impact artificial intelligence could have on the entire cloud software industry.The business software powerhouse is fighting back by investing heavily in AI efforts (Agentforce), boosting profitability, and paying dividends. Salesforce\u2019s earnings outlook has held up over the last year, and its valuation has improved significantly.Investors might want to buy Salesforce stock down 20% from its highs heading into its Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings release on Wednesday, May 28.\u00a0The Bull Case for Salesforce StockSalesforce is a pioneer across business software, customer relationship management, and software-as-a-service. CRM\u2019s growing portfolio supports sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond.\u00a0Companies big and small rely heavily on Salesforce\u2019s offerings that quickly become embedded into their businesses and are critical to day-to-day operations and beyond.The business software power grew its revenue by an average of roughly 29% for 10 years between 2012 and 2022. Salesforce prolonged its impressive YoY growth through some major acquisitions. But its days of 25% to 30% YoY growth are over\u2014its sales climbed 9% last year (fiscal 2025) and 11% in FY24.Salesforce\u2019s transformation into a more mature growth technology company like Microsoft (MSFT) and others forced it to focus on the bottom line. It has trimmed costs through job cuts and other efficiency efforts to boost its earnings over the long haul.Salesforce is returning value to shareholders via buybacks. Plus, CRM showcased its transition into a new era by declaring its first-ever dividend in 2024, joining the likes of Meta and Alphabet.CRM\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Push and Growth OutlookOn the AI front, Salesforce launched its Agentforce AI tool in October 2024. Salesforce\u2019s new AI-powered platform allows customers to use existing software tools to easily program \u201cagents\u201d for automating tasks like customer service, marketing campaigns, and customer/business procurement and development. Salesforce said last quarter that it landed 5,000 Agentforce deals since October, including more than 3,000 paid agreements.CRM boasted that its Data Cloud & AI annual recurring revenue climbed 120% YoY last year (FY25). Digging deeper, Salesforce said \u201cnearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI & Data Cloud customers,\u201d and all of its \u201ctop 10 wins in Q4 included Data and AI.\u201dThe company highlighted that Agentforce handled 380K conversations, \u201cachieving an 84% resolution rate, with only 2% of the requests requiring human escalation.\u201d The goal is to infuse generative\u00a0AI\u00a0across its entire product portfolio.Salesforce\u2019s AI push is critical as businesses across the U.S. and beyond race to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.Salesforce\u2019s earnings outlook has held up since its fourth quarter release, landing it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

QuoteEarnings Whispers for SalesforceOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Salesforce this earnings season.

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Likely to Influence Salesforce\u2019s Q1 ResultsSalesforce appears well-positioned to report strong first-quarter results, driven by its strategic focus on digital transformation and cloud solutions. With businesses globally undergoing digital overhauls, Salesforce's commitment to aligning its product offerings with customer needs is likely to have boosted its revenues for the quarter.The growing demand for generative AI-enabled cloud solutions has been a major catalyst for Salesforce. By embedding generative AI tools across its products, the company not only enhances customer engagement but also strengthens its competitive position in the customer relationship management space. This forward-thinking approach might have significantly contributed to its top-line growth during the to-be-reported quarter.Salesforce\u2019s ability to deepen relationships with leading brands across industries and expand its reach in key geographic markets remains a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company\u2019s increasing footprint in the public sector is likely to have provided a further boost, unlocking new growth opportunities during the first quarter.The acquisitions of Spiff, Own and Zoomin have been pivotal in enhancing Salesforce's capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. These additions are likely to have driven higher subscription revenues, particularly across its core cloud services. Salesforce\u2019s key cloud offerings, including Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data, are expected to have delivered robust growth.Our first-quarter revenue estimates for Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data cloud services are pegged at $2.14 billion, $2.34 billion, $1.84 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. We expect revenues of approximately $9.21 billion and $518.8 million for the Subscription and Support segment and the Professional Services division, respectively.The ongoing cost restructuring initiative is likely to have boosted Salesforce\u2019s profitability in the first quarter. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 33.1%, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of cost restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.CRM\u2019s Price Performance & ValuationOver the past year, Salesforce shares have risen 1.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 10.4%. Compared to its peers, CRM stock has also underperformed other enterprise software makers, including SAP SE SAP, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT. Over the past year, shares of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have gained 53.1%, 26.7% and 6%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let\u2019s look at the value Salesforce offers investors at the current levels. CRM stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.48X compared with the industry\u2019s 9.25X.CRM stock also trades at a discounted multiple compared with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/S multiples of 8.38X, 6.77X and 10.87X, respectively.Investment Thesis for Salesforce StockSalesforce is the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management industry, consistently outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Gartner\u2019s annual rankings reaffirm its top position year after year. Its ability to maintain this dominance stems from its expansive product suite, seamless integrations and innovative approach to enterprise solutions.Strategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in strengthening its market position. The $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack in 2021 significantly enhanced its collaboration capabilities, making Salesforce a comprehensive enterprise software provider. More recently, the $1.9-billion acquisition of Own Company in 2024 bolstered its data protection and AI capabilities, a move that aligns with growing enterprise priorities around security and automation.Salesforce\u2019s AI initiatives further cement its leadership. Since introducing Einstein GPT in March 2023, the company has expanded its AI-driven functionalities across its entire ecosystem. This technology enhances automation, streamlines workflows and improves customer interactions, giving Salesforce a significant advantage as AI adoption accelerates across industries.Additionally, Salesforce is positioned to benefit from the continued rise in worldwide IT spending. Gartner projects global IT spending to reach $5.61 trillion in 2025, implying a 9.8% year-over-year increase. Enterprise software spending is expected to grow even faster, rising 14.2% year over year. As digital transformation remains a top priority for businesses, Salesforce is well-positioned to capture a substantial share of these increasing budgets.Conclusion: Hold CRM Stock Ahead of Q1 ResultsThe company\u2019s leadership in customer relationship management, aggressive AI expansion and increasing enterprise IT spending trends create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Its ability to deliver earnings growth despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties makes the stock worth holding.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "It didn\u2019t really need much boosting, but Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT stock got more good news in a week when the market is looking for direction. The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union\u2019s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its\u00a0 market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a \u201cclear and complete resolution\u201d to its rivals\u2019 concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft\u2019s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it\u2019s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it\u2019s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That\u2019s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it\u2019s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft\u2019s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft\u2019s productivity applications.That\u2019s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a \u201cwalled garden\u201d effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company\u2019s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock\u2019s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock\u2019s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average. Also, Microsoft\u2019s estimated earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11.35% is below its three-year average of 15.9%. From a technical standpoint, the move lower on May 21 dropped the stock below its 50- and 200-day simple moving averages, which may be a sign that a reversal is in place.While short-term volatility exists, Microsoft's strong fundamentals and market position suggest a favorable outlook for investors. Analysts continue to bid the stock higher. The Microsoft analyst forecasts on MarketBeat give MSFT stock a Moderate Buy rating with a $512.63 price target that marks a 13% upside from its price on May 21.Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineThis article is from the free weekly Barron's Tech email newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox.Burying the Lead. At Google I/O, the search giant's annual developers conference, Alphabet-unit Google unveiled its answer to new AI search engines like Perplexity and ChatGPT, which are nipping at its heels. But Google Search's new \"AI Mode\" was buried beneath a blizzard of other announcements, some more important than others.Let's sort through it.Grinding Its Way to AI Relevance. Despite a decade of heavy investment into AI, Google wound up racing from behind when OpenAI's ChatGPT leapfrogged it in November 2022. While we still await some of the most advanced products that were announced at I/O, Google's underlying AI technology seems to be catching up through heavy investment and rapid iteration.Handicapped. AI Mode is an important step in Google's battle to stave off new competition from AI search engines. It pairs the benefits of AI with the power of Google Search's unparalleled web index. But the implementation shows how the search giant is handicapped in this battle.Accessing AI Mode requires an extra click, which will likely reduce usage. In designing the new interface element, Google had to be careful not to break the search experience that users know so well \u2014 type and hit return. Perplexity and ChatGPT don't have a legacy interface to serve, and they can make the AI search experience more natural.Making AI Is Hard, but It's Easier Than Making Products. AI announcements at I/O included AI Mode, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini Live, Gemini in Chrome, Veo 3, Imagen 4, Flow, Beam, Canvas, Agent Mode, and that doesn't include experimental products like Project Aura and Project Astra.Without looking it up, can anyone tell me what all these things do, and why I should use them? The product branding feels removed from the use case, potentially leading to customer confusion.This gets back to Google's longtime problem with turning tech into products. As tracked by the website KilledByGoogle.com, Google has shut down 296 products over the years. It has had 13 messaging apps, four of which are still going.Google's challenge is bringing all these strands together in a way that makes a simple pitch to users, the same way Search did in 1997.Making Agents Happen. One loud-and-clear message from both Google I/O and Microsoft's Monday Build conference is that AI \"agents\" are where these companies see the future. Agents are apps that work on top of an AI language model, automating a series of tasks from simple commands. Microsoft is pitching them to its business customers, while Google unveiled Agent Mode for consumer use.For Google, it's vital to maintain control of these AI personal assistants. Once let loose in a browser, these agents can go everywhere a human goes, including searching on Google. The issue is AI agents don't care about Google's advertising. At some point in the not-too-distant future, a large portion of web traffic may be AI agents. All ad-supported services, including Google Search, should find that troubling.But if Google is the one providing the agents, it can monetize them, making up for the loss of human traffic on the web.This Week in Barron's Tech- Nvidia Is Opening Its AI Server Platform to Chip Rivals. Broadcom Isn't on the List. - Jensen Huang Says 'Deeply Painful' China Ban on Nvidia's H20 Chips Will Cut Sales by $15 Billion - Netflix Nears $500 Billion Market Cap.

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineThis past week's biggest tech event occurred not on U.S. shores, but in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.President Donald Trump arrived for an official visit with a high-powered retinue of tech leaders that included AI frenemies Elon Musk and Sam Altman to discuss, what else, artificial intelligence.Like many countries that can afford it, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it controls its own AI future with onshore \"sovereign AI\" data centers. It was one of the main reasons for Trump's visit. Saudi leaders needed Trump's OK to get the highest-powered AI chips from U.S.-based Nvidia. Nvidia, for its part, has been pointing to sovereign AI as a growth driver since its November 2023 earnings call.\"National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative,\" CEO Jensen Huang said on that call, about a year after ChatGPT launched the current AI boom. \"People realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture, for somebody else to then resell AI back to them.\"Back then, the first sovereign AI that Huang mentioned was in India, a multicultural tapestry of 22 official languages joined by another 100 that are still in use. It's in India's self-interest that AI language models from other countries don't wipe out its millennia of rich cultural history and to ensure that its nascent tech scene has access to the latest technology. Thus the need for domestic AI data centers under the national government's control, or sovereign AI.Pegged around Trump's Tuesday visit, Saudi Arabia announced its vehicle for sovereign investment into AI, called Humain, whose chairman is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's part of his $100 billion \"Project Transcendence,\" aimed at making Saudi Arabia an international tech hub.For now, Humain will only use AI chips from start-up Groq, which already operates a data center in Saudi Arabia. But over the next five years, Humain says it will build out massive Saudi data centers populated by the most advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\"Our partnership with Nvidia is a bold step forward in realizing the Kingdom's ambitions to lead in AI and advanced digital infrastructure,\" Tareq Amin, CEO of Humain, said in an Nvidia blog post. Investors cheered the announcements, sending AI names like Nvidia and AMD higher this past week.While it's hard to pin down future revenue tied to these sovereign AI programs, BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya said that the new deals could eventually be 10% to 15% of annual AI infrastructure revenue. In the long term, that would add up to a total of roughly $50 billion a year for Nvidia, AMD, and others, Arya estimates.The announcements this past week are a sign of how political dynamics have changed with the second Trump presidency. In its waning days, the Biden administration announced new export rules to keep advanced AI processors out of China's hands.Those rules were designed to force sovereign AI companies like Humain to agree to a strict set of conditions to gain access to the best tech from Nvidia.The test case was G42, a technology arm attached to a United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund. After agreeing to strict U.S. terms, it got the first approval to build a major AI data center on the Arabian peninsula, in partnership with Microsoft.But countries like Saudi Arabia saw the restrictions as too harsh, and Huang believed it would slow down Nvidia's growing sovereign AI business. Trump listened to them.On the eve of the rules taking effect, Trump's Department of Commerce canceled them in preparation for his Mideast trip, replacing the process with case-by-case approval at the president's discretion. The Saudis were the first to get the thumbs-up. (There were no such announcements during Trump's trips to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this past week, though they may still come.)China still casts a shadow over any deal. The Saudis gave assurances that Humain wouldn't buy AI accelerators or anything else from prohibited Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies. Should Humain knowingly allow a Chinese entity to use its cloud for training models, it would risk access to advanced technology.But that still doesn't go quite as far as what G42 originally agreed to. It promised not to engage in any sort of commerce with Chinese entities, a pledge not publicly made by the Saudis this past week.The U.S. also insisted that G42 allow Microsoft to run operations at its Abu Dhabi data center, and submit to U.S. security audits to make sure its actions matched its assurances. Neither of those arrangements have been mentioned by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.Trump's new stance on AI exports is ultimately a good news/bad news situation for U.S. firms. Easier AI export terms are a positive for Nvidia, AMD, and other U.S. data center hardware companies.But Biden's policy was designed to quickly move countries into compliance with stringent U.S. rules around China. Trump's country-by-country approach may actually slow things down in the end.This Week in Barron's Tech- CoreWeave Stock Jumps on Strong Revenue - Cisco Reports Solid Earnings.

    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.Get Your Asset Mix RightThere may be nothing more critical for your portfolio than figuring out the right mix of stocks, bonds, and other holdings. Once you have the mix, you can drill down into funds, stocks, or other investments, making tweaks to address changes in the market and your personal experience.Advisors can help you find the right allocation. Free online tools like Vanguard's Investing Style Quiz can be useful, or consider paid tools like Morningstar Investor.Don't ignore your psychology. You might think you're an aggressive investor \u2014 until the markets tank and your portfolio falls 30%, making you question whether it was a good idea to own so much tech. As Mike Tyson said, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.Greg Dukes, senior vice president at MFA Wealth in Pittsburgh, revisits client portfolios every six months. The importance of this practice hit home during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when the S&P 500 lost more than 50% and some clients were surprised to discover they had an aggressive asset allocation.An aggressive mix for an investor who is still working could be 85% stocks/15% bonds and cash, or as much as 90% stocks for young people with many decades until retirement.Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon might want to double down on tech, Dukes says. If you think that AI will continue to fuel market growth in the coming years, you could layer in an exchange-traded fund such as Vanguard Information Technology, which has big holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, Dukes says.A typical moderate mix is 60% stocks/40% bonds, while a conservative mix would skew toward more fixed income, with 30% in stocks and 70% in bonds.It's rarely appropriate for a retiree to have an aggressive allocation. One exception might be an investor who has a large portion of expenses covered by a pension, and who can stomach temporary equity losses better than someone who relies on their portfolio to pay the bills.Retired investors could have a riskier sleeve within their larger equity portfolio. A good place to hold growth-oriented stocks is in a post-tax Roth IRA account, Dukes notes. Since taxes are paid upfront on contributions, growth is tax-free. And if the money isn't needed during the retiree's life, it's a great vehicle to pass along tax-free to heirs.Avoid most actively managed funds and stick with index funds. Reams of research show that a very low percentage of funds beat their benchmarks over long periods, especially after taxes.Index funds are inherently tax-efficient; since they hardly ever make changes, capital gains are minimal and your income would come from dividends. Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash \u2014 the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. \"You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,\" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The \"real,\" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure.

Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg.

    "descriptionText": "Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works \u2014 camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI \u2014 as an alternative portal to the web \u2014 is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem \u2014 how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the \"AI Ultra\" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was \"not budging,\" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - \"We're in center position,\" Daly said. \"My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in.\" - \"I am a person of action,\" Hammack said. \"But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands.\" Bostic was more definitive. \"I don't have a recession in my outlook,\" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. \"I think I've done enough,\" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has \"already turned around,\" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said \"I did what needed to be done.\"- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm. A recession could change all that by pushing prices lower in some parts of the U.S.- Existing-home sales are down 2.2% through March despite a 5.5% gain in the number of properties for sale, says National Association of Realtors senior economist Nadia Evangelou. Sellers expect 2021's sky-high prices and buyers want 2011's post-bubble deals, says eXp Realty CEO Leo Pareja. - Nationally, sellers cut prices on nearly one in five listings last month, a larger share than any April since at least 2017, according to Realtor.com. (Barron's owner News Corp owns Realtor.com operator Move.) That's shifting the market to one that favors buyers. - During this spring's home buying season, many shoppers opted to \"hang tight and hold out\" through market and mortgage rate fluctuations, says Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research & Consulting. Zillow expects home values to drop 1.4% this year as more sellers enter than buyers. - While recession fears have calmed somewhat since the U.S.-China trade war de-escalation, in a recession, some areas of the U.S. housing market could see prices fall as much as 10%, says Ivy Zelman, co-founder of housing analytics firm Zelman & Associates. Actual results depend on local housing dynamics. What's Next: A recession could bring the opportunity buyers are waiting for. Homes nationally are overvalued by 11%, according to Fitch Ratings. Price declines would remove some of the hot air introduced during the pandemic's home-price explosion.- Shaina Mishkin***Dear Quentin,I am in a quandary, and I hope you can help. My last surviving brother, 82, is a widower and a veteran on disability, with 70% of his expenses paid. He also inherited some stocks from his late wife. He has 2 children, including a son in his mid-50s, who moved to Atlanta when his mom got sick. We both feel he's not quite trustworthy.His daughter is in her late 40s, has two children, 13 and 3, and lives within an hour of her dad. For about two years during her mother's illness, she would drive up nearly every weekend to help her mom by shopping, making dinners, cleaning, and tending the garden. When her mother died, she didn't come up as often. When she did, she said she was helping her dad pay bills.About a year in, we learned all was not what it seemed. This \"good daughter,\" during her many trips to her father, had siphoned about $70,000 from her father's accounts, using her mother's old credit card. She will not explain why she did it or what the money was for. He did not press charges of theft or elder abuse, but they no longer speak.He has a large old house, valued at about $170,000, and many valuable antiques. I will be the executor of his estate. At first, he didn't want to give her anything. We've moved on to the son getting half and the daughter getting half, but there is $70,000 in a trust for her children for college. If they choose not to go to college, the trust will remain till they reach 21. Should she still get an inheritance?- Sister/AuntRead the Moneyist's response here.- Quentin Fottrell***- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Rupert SteinerThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "The contest in Silicon Valley to dominate artificial intelligence is playing out on a new court: superstar researchers.While the scramble to attract top talent and keep them happy has always been a hallmark of the tech industry, since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, recruiting has escalated to professional athlete levels, a dozen people who have been involved in recruiting AI researchers told Reuters.\u201cThe AI labs approach hiring like a game of chess,\u201d said Ariel Herbert-Voss, CEO of cybersecurity startup RunSybil and a former OpenAI researcher who entered the talent fight after launching his own company. \u201cThey want to move as fast as possible, so they are willing to pay a lot for candidates with specialized and complementary expertise, much like the game pieces. They are like, do I have enough rooks? Enough knights?\u201dCompanies including OpenAI and Google, eager to get or stay ahead in the race to create the best AI models, court these so-called \u201cICs\u201d \u2013 the individual contributors whose work can make or break companies.Noam Brown, one of the researchers behind OpenAI\u2019s recent AI breakthroughs in complex math and science reasoning, said when he explored job opportunities in 2023, he found himself being courted by tech\u2019s elite: lunch with Google founder Sergey Brin, poker at Sam Altman\u2019s, and a private jet visit from an eager investor. Elon Musk will also make calls to close candidates for xAI, his AI company, said two people who have spoken to him. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, Brown said, he chose OpenAI because OpenAI was willing to put resources \u2013 both people and compute \u2013 behind the work he was excited about.\u201cIt was actually financially not the best option that I had,\u201d he said, explaining that compensation is not the most important thing for many researchers. That hasn\u2019t stopped companies from throwing millions of dollars in bonuses and pay packages at star researchers, according to seven sources familiar with the matter.A few top OpenAI researchers who have indicated interest in joining former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever\u2019s new company, SSI, were offered retention bonuses of $2 million, in addition to equity increases of $20 million or more, if they stayed, two sources told Reuters. Some have only been required to stay for a year in order to get the entire bonus. SSI and OpenAI declined to comment. Other OpenAI researchers who have fielded offers from Eleven Labs have received bonuses of at least $1 million to stay at OpenAI, two sources told Reuters. Top OpenAI researchers regularly receive compensation packages of over $10 million a year, sources said.Google DeepMind has offered top researchers $20 million per year compensation packages, awarded off-cycle equity grants specifically to AI researchers, and has also reduced vesting on some stock packages to 3 years, instead of the normal 4 years, sources said.

    "descriptionText": "Nebius Group N.V . NBIS will report its first-quarter 2025 results on May 20, before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 45 cents. The estimate has remained unchanged in the past seven days but has been revised downward by 4 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pinned at $63.8 million.Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is positioning itself as a specialized AI infrastructure company. Its core operation is Nebius, which is an AI-powered cloud platform designed for intensive AI and ML workloads in both owned and colocation data center capacity. It resumed trading as a public company in October 2024.What Our Model Predicts for NBIS\u2019 Q1Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NBIS this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NBIS has an Earnings ESP of -7.87% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nebius Group N.V. Price and EPS SurpriseNebius Group N.V. price-eps-surprise | Nebius Group N.V. QuoteFactors to Focus on Ahead of NBIS\u2019 Q1 EarningsNebius is focused on boosting its data center footprint and its GPU deployments as part of its strategy to ramp up installed capacity across the United States and Europe. Establishing facilities in the United States means lower latency while serving domestic clients and boosting the advantages of the AI-native cloud. In March 2025, NBIS also announced the setting up of a new data center in New Jersey. This data center will \u200dboast a total capacity of 300 MW, and the first phase is expected to be completed by the summer of 2025. The same day, it also announced incremental capacity additions at its existing colocation facility in Kansas City. The additional capacity is expected to come online by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As it expands AI infrastructure in Europe, NBIS also announced a new colocation deployment in Keflavik, Iceland.It is focusing on establishing more GPU clusters across the United States amid soaring demand for high-quality AI infrastructure. NBIS is also focused on strengthening its global sales and marketing efforts with a specific focus on the US market. These factors are likely to have aided the top-line performance. In the last reported quarter, NBIS unveiled its new AI cloud platform and migrated all its customers onto it. The company also introduced an Inference-as-a-Service platform called AI Studio. Given these factors, along with contracts in place, NBIS expects its March run rate revenue to be at least $220 million.Apart from its core cloud platform, other notable offerings by Nebius include Toloka, an AI development platform; TripleTen, an edtech service; and Avride, an autonomous vehicle platform. Contract wins for its Avride autonomous technology platform business augur well. Efforts to diversify the client base for its Toloka platform and transition to a new platform, which is tuned for complex GenAI tasks, are likely to have aided in driving revenues from this business. Revenues for the full year 2024 grew 140% for Toloka.Nonetheless, a challenging global macroeconomic environment and increasing lead times as customers become more selective are expected to weigh on the top-line expansion. NBIS is investing significantly in expanding capacity, which is expected to keep margins under pressure, at least in the near term.Nebius is a relatively new entrant in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. These behemoths already have a global-scale AI cloud, whereas NBIS is still expanding its infrastructure. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market.NBIS Stock PerformanceNebius shares have lost 19.5% over the past three months, underscoring broader and company-specific challenges. The stock has also underperformed the Zacks Computer & Technology sector decline of 5.1% and the Zacks Internet Software Services industry\u2019s gain of 4.3%.Price PerformanceThe company has underperformed its peers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Alphabet and Amazon shares have plunged 11.3% and 10.3%, respectively, in the same time frame, while Microsoft has gained 10.7%.NBIS' ValuationIn terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 2.59X, lower than the Internet Software Services industry\u2019s ratio of 4.12, but it could mean more risk than opportunity.Investment Thesis for NBIS StockGiven Nebius' ongoing investments in its core AI infrastructure platform and promising growth in Toloka and Avride platforms, long-term potential remains.

The updated May 5 proposal \"does not adequately\" protect governance safeguards, which are about whether the startup \"would continue to have a legally enforceable obligation to advance the charitable mission above all else,\" the letter said. The group, in its April 17 letter to the attorneys general, raised concerns regarding OpenAI's proposed restructuring that would hand over control of the development and deployment of artificial general intelligence to a for-profit enterprise from a nonprofit charity. The Monday letter also said that under the May 5 updated proposal, the only difference is that OpenAI-nonprofit would have \"some\" form of control over OpenAI-public benefit corporation, where directors would not have a \"primary fiduciary duty\" to carry forward the startup's charitable mission \"above all else.\"\"As the Attorneys General of OpenAI-nonprofit's state of incorporation and the location where its charitable assets are held, you have the authority and responsibility to protect OpenAI-nonprofit's charitable mission and assets,\" the group wrote. The group said that it is not minimizing the \"significance\" of the proposed changes, but it emphasizes to \"underscore the singular importance\" of ensuring that the startup continues to have a \"legally enforceable obligation\" towards the charitable mission. Microsoft referred MT Newswires to OpenAI for comment. \"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, is today a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a nonprofit that oversees and controls the for-profit,\" an OpenAI spokesperson referred MT Newswires to the startup's May 5 blog. \"That will not change,\" OpenAI said in the blog. \"We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware. We look forward to advancing the details of this plan in continued conversation with them, Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners,\" OpenAI also added in the blog. The offices of the attorneys general did not respond to MT Newswires' requests for comment.",

But after Moody's stripped the government of its coveted AAA-status last week and 30-year bond yields topped 5.15% earlier this week, the highest since 2007, investors are starting to see value.Around $25 billion in new money found its way into bond portfolios in the latest week, BofA's flow report indicated, outpacing the $16 billion moved into cash. Stock funds, meanwhile, suffered their first outflows in two months, losing $4.1 billion even as the S&P 500 rallied to within 3% of its all time high.Oscar Wilde once noted that a cynic is the sort of person that knows the price of everything, but the value of nothing. As Treasuries sold off this week, there appeared to be plenty of cynics focused on the government bonds' levels and the impact of U.S. fiscal profligacy, discounting the value in the trade as a result.Long-dated yields are moving lower in early Friday trading, and could rally even further next week if minutes from the Federal Reserve's May policy meeting hint another rate cut or a tamer-than-expected reading of the April's personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, inflation gauge.\"[There is] nothing more contrarian in 2025 than being long the long-end, \" BofA writes. \"And while the 2020s spending of Biden's Build Back Better + taxation of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill don't a AAA-rating make, we say return of bond vigilantes to (the 5% level on 30-year Treasury yields) is a cyclical buy opportunity.\"Write to editors@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL \u2013 May 16, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Here are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:META vs. MSFT: Which AI Superpower Is a Better Buy?Meta Platforms and Microsoft have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft\u2019s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers\u2019 return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META\u2019s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms\u2019 focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI\u2019s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META\u2019s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies.Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month.Microsoft is now extending Copilot\u2019s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft. Since April 2, Microsoft shares have appreciated 18.6% while Meta Platforms returned 12.8%.META & MSFT\u2019s Earnings Estimate Revisions PositiveThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for META\u2019s 2025 earnings is pegged at $25.52 per share, up by 2.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 6.96% increase over fiscal 2024\u2019s reported figure.Meta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for Microsoft\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 2% to $13.30 per share over the past 30 days, suggesting 12.71% growth over 2024.Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteBoth META\u2019s and MSFT\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. Meta Platforms\u2019 average surprise of 17.3% is better than Microsoft\u2019s surprise of 5.21%, reflecting good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: META is Cheaper Than MSFTBoth Meta Platforms and Microsoft are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Meta Platforms shares are trading at 8.57X, lower than Microsoft\u2019s 10.9X.ConclusionAlthough both Microsoft and Meta Platforms are leveraging AI to boost their prospects Microsoft is better positioned compared with META given strong adoption of Copilot, Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business.Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Meta Platforms, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ORCL.Can Saudi AI Deals Boost AMD Over NVIDIA, and Is It a Buy?Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is ruling the data center sector, and is giving stiff competition to NVIDIA Corp. by acquiring some of its major clients. Now, with AMD inking a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain, the query arises on AMD\u2019s potential to surpass NVIDIA in the long term and its investment appeal. Let\u2019s analyze.Saudi AI Push Is Beneficial for Both AMD & NVIDIASeveral semiconductor companies were wary of moribund economic growth affecting spending on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The companies were concerned about the impact of ongoing geopolitical tensions on AI investments. However, the concerns have ebbed since Saudi Arabia and U.S. chip companies signed new deals.AMD announced a $10 billion partnership with Saudi AI firm Humain to expand its AI infrastructure over the next five years, aiming to counter the effects of U.S. export restrictions to China. However, AMD isn\u2019t the only one set to benefit from Saudi AI initiatives.

Ferguson is beginning to shut down some efforts started by his predecessor Lina Khan, including dropping a case on Thursday that had accused PepsiCo NASDAQ:PEP of price discrimination that favored Walmart NYSE:WMT .The FTC lost an appeal on May 7 seeking to reverse a judge's decision declining to block the Microsoft-Activision deal, which closed in 2023.Microsoft President Brad Smith said on Thursday that the FTC's decision to drop the case was \"a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C.\"When challenging a new merger, the FTC typically asks a judge to temporarily block the deal to give the agency time to challenge it in its own administrative court. But deals that are temporarily blocked are often abandoned.Though the FTC lost its case seeking to block the deal temporarily, the agency could have sought to unwind the acquisition at a trial that was scheduled for July.The Activision Blizzard transaction marked the largest-ever acquisition in the video gaming market. The FTC claimed the tie-up would allow Microsoft to fend off competitors to the Xbox console and to its subscription and cloud-based gaming business.",

    "descriptionText": "Alphabet's NASDAQ:GOOG Google kicks off its annual developer conference on Tuesday with a flurry of announcements showcasing its huge investment in artificial intelligence, while seeking to fend off concerns over the future of its business.The I/O conference in Mountain View, California has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's long-time stronghold organizing and retrieving information on the internet.In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed NASDAQ:MSFT OpenAI's ChatGPT.Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta NASDAQ:META .Now, with consumer usage of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking how aggressive Google is in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue.Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple NASDAQ:AAPL executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari web browser for the first time.In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics.A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years.The analysts pointed to a behavioral shift drawing consumers towards AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines.Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser.Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs.Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries.Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a \"universal AI agent.\"At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time.The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat.Meanwhile, Google is growing other revenue streams to monetize AI.

    "descriptionText": "By Nate WolfAfter a year of lagging behind its Magnificent Seven peers, Microsoft stock has plenty of room to rise in the year ahead, Wall Street analysts say.On Thursday, analysts at both Citi and Evercore issued positive outlooks for Microsoft, citing the strength of the tech giant's Azure cloud-computing arm, the payoff from its enterprise artificial-intelligence investments, and the cost savings of recent job cuts.Citi, which has a Buy rating on the stock, lifted its target price to $540 from $480 \u2014 a roughly 20% increase from Wednesday's close of $450.44. Evercore maintained its $500 price target and Outperform rating ahead of the investment bank's Microsoft 360 Day event on May 20.The stamps of approval from Wall Street are welcome news for Microsoft as it battles to keep pace with other megacap tech stocks.Over the past year, the company's 12-month price-to-earnings ratio has gained just 7%, compared with 29% for Roundhill's Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, according to data from FactSet.Trimming costs could help. Microsoft said Tuesday it will reduce its workforce by around 3%, equaling several thousand employees. A company spokesperson told Barron's the cuts would \"best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.\"Citi analysts see the layoffs as a positive, estimating they could save Microsoft roughly 4%, or $2.5 billion a year, in operating expenses.Meanwhile, the days of massive capital spending growth associated with AI infrastructure might finally be over, Evercore's analysts noted. They predict year-over-year capital expenditure growth has likely peaked. All that past investment now has the potential to pay off down the road.\"While the cost burden related to new AI infrastructure is being felt today, the revenue associated with these investments will be recognized for years to come,\" the Evercore analysts wrote.The AI boom could be particularly helpful for Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business, which had seen growth fluctuate in past quarters.At the start of the month, Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, buoyed by 33% year-over-year growth for Azure. And both groups of analysts now estimate Azure revenue will grow more than 30% through the company's next fiscal year.With growth in its core business areas stabilizing and expenses under control after a surge in AI investment, Microsoft could be in line for a strong finish to the calendar year.The tech giant is already off to a solid start.

Sharma said Microsoft plans to add more popular models soon.\"One of the most important parts to be able to build an app and seamlessly use the most popular models is making sure your reserved capacity that you have with Azure OpenAI starts to work across the most popular models,\" Sharma said.Microsoft also said on Monday that it was creating a way for AI agents to have the same kind of digital identifier as human employees inside a company's systems.\"The concept of treating agents as digital employees is the kind of groundbreaking change that will both open some impressive new capabilities but also raise concerns about the impact that AI is going to make in the workplace,\" said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.",

[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI started in 2019 with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft.\u00a0Over the next several years, that investment grew to over\u00a0 $13 billion , giving\u00a0Microsoft access to OpenAI\u2019s\u00a0 ChatGPT generative AI program .\u00a0In that time, Microsoft built its network of AI agents (i.e., Copilots) that ran on top of ChatGPT.This relationship vaulted Microsoft to the forefront of the AI race, and shareholders were the beneficiaries.\u00a0MSFT stock has delivered a\u00a0 total return of over 140% in the last five years.However, since 2023, the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has become more strained, starting with OpenAI\u2019s decision to fire Sam Altman in December 2022 . At that point, the company\u2019s partnership was yielding positive benefits for both sides . But it also crystallized the idea that the partnership would have to evolve or end.Breaking Up Is Hard to DoIn January 2025, OpenAI and Microsoft seemed to be heading for a messy breakup . At that time, Microsoft confirmed that it was no longer going to be OpenAI\u2019s sole cloud provider . However, OpenAI was making a \u201c new, large commitment \u201d to Microsoft\u2019s AI cloud computing platform, Azure .OpenAI was planning to place its business under the control of a for-profit business . That plan has now been abandoned.\u00a0However, the company\u2019s goals of being a\u00a0public company haven\u2019t ended, and it will now\u00a0be financed by none other than Microsoft .That\u2019s right. While the terms of the new funding aren\u2019t completely clear, it appears that OpenAI will be using some of the $13 billion from Microsoft to fund an initial public offering (IPO) . But the plot thickens. Microsoft is expected to have an undefined level of equity in OpenAI\u2019s new business. However, reports are saying that Microsoft may be willing to reduce its equity stake if OpenAI allows Microsoft to have access to new technology developed by OpenAI after the 2030 cutoff .This would be a key concession from OpenAI and it would be yet another reason for long-term investors to be bullish on MSFT stock . [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:MSFT] The OpenAI News Allows MSFT Shareholders to Focus on the Bigger PictureMicrosoft stock is up about 3% in a week when the bulls returned to Wall Street.

With AI expected to define technology trends for the next 10-20 years, Alibaba's early positioning and continued investment in this area represent a significant long-term growth driver.Attractive Valuation Presents Compelling Entry PointDespite strong performance metrics and promising growth vectors, Alibaba trades at a significant discount to peers. The stock's forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio of 11.07X is less than half the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry average of 22.29X, suggesting BABA shares are substantially undervalued relative to growth potential.BABA\u2019s P/E F12M Ratio Depicts Discounted ValuationThis valuation disconnect becomes even more apparent when considering Alibaba's performance against competitors. While shares have gained an impressive 42.3% year to date, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 2.2%, 3% and 0.7%, respectively, the company still trades at a much lower multiple than comparable tech giants.BABA Beats Peers & Sector Year to DateThis performance stands in stark contrast to global e-commerce bigwigs like Amazon AMZN and eBay EBAY, highlighting Alibaba's relative strength. BABA also faces rising competition from the leading cloud players, namely Amazon, Microsoft MSFT and Google. Shares of Amazon have lost 6.5% year to date, while eBay and Microsoft have returned 15% and 8.5%, respectively.Alibaba's commitment to shareholder returns further enhances its investment case. The company's board approved an annual dividend of $1.05 per ADS (a 5% increase) plus a special dividend of 95 cents per ADS, bringing total cash dividends to $2.00 per ADS ($4.6 billion). Combined with $11.9 billion in share repurchases, Alibaba returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2025, affirming management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects.Investment Outlook: Positioned for Long-Term GrowthWith its core e-commerce business delivering solid performance, accelerating cloud and AI segments showing triple-digit growth, and international commerce operations expanding rapidly (22% revenue growth this quarter), Alibaba presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company's financial strength, with a strong net cash position of $50.5 billion, provides ample resources to fund strategic investments while continuing to reward shareholders.While Alibaba faces competition from global e-commerce and cloud computing players, its discounted valuation, strong financial results, and strategic positioning in high-growth areas like AI make BABA stock a smart buy for investors seeking both value and growth potential in 2025. BABA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the number of customers that contributed more than $1 million in the trailing 12-month product revenue increased from 455 as of Jan. 31, 2024, to 580 as of Jan. 31, 2025.As of Jan. 31, 2025, SNOW had 11,159 customers, increasing from 9,384 customers as of Jan. 31, 2024. The clientele included 745 of the Forbes Global 2000 and accounted for 45% of SNOW\u2019s fiscal 2025 revenues of $3.6 billion, up 29% from fiscal 2024. This strong momentum is expected to have carried into the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Snowflake expects product revenues in the range of 955-$960 million. The projection range indicates year-over-year growth of 21-22%.Snowflake\u2019s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, including the introduction of Cortex AI and its integration with models from OpenAI and Anthropic, continue to drive customer engagement. More than 4,000 customers are utilizing Snowflake\u2019s AI and ML technology on a weekly basis, which is expected to have positively impacted the company\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.SNOW Outperforms Sector and IndustrySnowflake shares have surged 18.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s decrease of 1.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry\u2019s increase of 7.2%. The outperformance in SNOW stock is driven by its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base.\u00a0YTD PerformanceSNOW Stock is Currently OvervaluedSNOW stock is not so cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, SNOW is trading at 12.81X, higher than the Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 6.18X.Price/Sales (F12M)SNOW Benefits From Expanding PortfolioSnowflake\u2019s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. Products like Apache Iceberg and Hybrid tables, Polaris, Cortex Large Language Model and ML functions are helping Snowflake win new clients.\u00a0Building on this momentum, in April 2025, Snowflake enhanced its AI Data Cloud by integrating core capabilities with Apache Iceberg tables. This enabled seamless open lakehouse strategies, improved query performance, comprehensive security, and data sharing while advancing open-source contributions.Further strengthening its offerings in May 2025, SNOW announced the expansion of its AI Data Cloud with automotive-specific solutions, driving digital transformation and AI innovation across the automotive industry.SNOW\u2019s Expanding AI Partnerships Drive GrowthSNOW\u2019s strong partner base, which includes major players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, ServiceNow, Fiserv, EY, LTMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, is expected to have been a major growth driver of its success.In April 2025, SNOW announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft to integrate OpenAI\u2019s models into Snowflake Cortex AI through Azure OpenAI Service, empowering enterprises to build AI-powered apps. This collaboration also brings Snowflake Cortex Agents to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams, enhancing productivity with AI-driven insights.Snowflake\u2019s partnership with NVIDIA enables businesses to build customized AI data applications using Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, driving enhanced AI performance and integration.SNOW\u2019s partnership with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has expanded to drive customer-focused innovation, enhance industry-specific solutions, deepen product integrations, and increase collaborative sales and marketing efforts to serve more than 6,000 joint customers, including major Fortune 500 companies.SNOW Shares \u2013 Buy, Sell or Hold?Snowflake benefits from a rich partner base, expanding clientele and an innovative portfolio, but is weighed down by competitive pressures and rising costs.\u00a0Snowflake also expects a tougher year-over-year revenue comparison in the to-be-reported quarter due to lapping the leap year, which will impact the company\u2019s top-line growth.Snowflake also expects the first quarter of fiscal 2026 non-GAAP operating margin to be impacted by approximately $15 million in expenses related to its annual sales kickoff event. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.Currently, SNOW carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that investors should wait for a better entry point to accumulate the stock.

CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39.\u00a0With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let\u2019s address this question by evaluating the company\u2019s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV\u2019s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV\u2019s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO.\u00a0Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter\u2019s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement\u2019s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave\u2019s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point. However, existing investors can hold the stock as its growth prospects remain intact.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "It didn\u2019t really need much boosting, but Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT stock got more good news in a week when the market is looking for direction. The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union\u2019s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its\u00a0 market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a \u201cclear and complete resolution\u201d to its rivals\u2019 concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft\u2019s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it\u2019s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it\u2019s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That\u2019s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it\u2019s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft\u2019s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft\u2019s productivity applications.That\u2019s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a \u201cwalled garden\u201d effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company\u2019s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock\u2019s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock\u2019s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average.

CEO Christian Klein said its products were important for helping to manage tariffs, so the general uncertainty wasn't hurting demand.Second, it's only at the front end of moving products and clients to the cloud, as well as adding artificial intelligence capabilities to its software. That means there is still untapped potential for greater productivity and returns there.With 86% of its sales coming from repeat customers, SAP has a knack for keeping its current clients. But also, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Moerdler noted that \"two-thirds of the net new cloud customers were new to SAP, which shows the strength of their offerings.\"At the same time, the sky probably isn't the limit, even for high-powered tech giants. SAP's peers such as Oracle, Microsoft, or Google-owner Alphabet haven't risen nearly as much recently, and SAP trades at a hefty premium. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at about 56, compared with 37 for Oracle, 35 for Microsoft, and 18 for Alphabet.Nevertheless, most analysts still rate the shares a Buy, with an average price target of EUR300. The stock traded at about EUR265 on Friday. The event with Wall Street analysts will shed some more light on whether that valuation is justified.Write to Brian Swint at brian.swint@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

    "descriptionText": "IonQ, Inc. IONQ has captured investor attention with a sharp 21.2% rise in its stock price following its first-quarter 2025 earnings release on May 7. This impressive rally outpaced gains in the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500, highlighting renewed enthusiasm around the company\u2019s bold expansion into commercial quantum systems and secure communication infrastructure. While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq\u2019s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella\u2019s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ\u2019s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\u00a0Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ\u2019s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ\u2019s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors.\u00a0Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ\u2019s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company\u2019s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ\u2019s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption.

Despite reporting a net loss of $149.6 million or -$1.49 per share, CoreWeave\u2019s rapid top-line expansion alluded to its future earnings potential, with Q1 sales skyrocketing 420% from a year ago to $981.6 million.Adding to bullish investor sentiment was that Nvidia NVDA\u00a0disclosed a major stake in CoreWeave in a 13F filing, with the chip giant owning 24.18 million CRWV shares. As a key partner and investor, Nvidia provides high-performance GPUs for CoreWeave's AI cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, CoreWeave announced it has secured a $4.1 billion deal with OpenAI, with some of its other noteworthy customers being Microsoft MSFT\u00a0and Meta Platforms META.CRWV spiked more than +35% this week and has now soared over +100% since its IPO, hitting an all-time high of $84 a share today.Cisco Systems \u2013 CSCOComputer networking giant Cisco Systems CSCO\u00a0continued to display its strong operational performance after eclipsing top and bottom-line expectations for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Fueling Cisco\u2019s growth is that the company has catered its networking, security, and data center solutions for AI workloads.This led to Cisco\u2019s Security segment revenue climbing 54% to $2.01 billion, with the company reporting over $600 million in AI infrastructure orders during the quarter. Overall, Cisco\u2019s Q3 sales rose 11% to $14.15 billion compared to $12.7 billion a year ago and topped estimates of $14.05 billion.

    "descriptionText": "Anxiety is running high as Trump's policies upend markets. These moves can protect your portfolio and help secure your retirement. s By Elizabeth O'BrienRetirement planning always involves peering into a crystal ball, but the outlook seems murkier than ever.The stock market has made a head-spinning round trip, recouping the nearly 20% losses that followed President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2. But the policy uncertainty that fueled the gyrations remains, along with larger questions about America's changing role in the world and what that means for investors.Retirement planning requires making assumptions \u2014 about how long you'll live, what kind of returns the markets will deliver, what inflation rate will prevail, how policy decisions will shape your finances. Now, the range of outcomes seems greater than at any time in at least a generation. Short-term forecasting has grown harder, too, as investors wonder if they should respond to every policy announcement and social-media post from the White House, or tune out the frantic news feeds.For investors who are tempted to react to every new development, some restraint is in order. \"This is not the time to treat your portfolio like it's a global macro hedge fund,\" says David Schneider, a Certified Financial Planner and founder of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York City.The bigger question is how to build a portfolio \u2014 whether it's for income, growth, or a mix of both. Those with decades to go in the workforce can be more aggressive \u2014 owning more stocks and other assets with higher volatility. Older adults who are retired or approaching retirement may need more stability and income.Here are some ways to insulate yourself from volatility and create a resilient retirement portfolio.Be Realistic About the Next DecadeEven before the Trump administration put its stamp on the global economy, investment firms had dialed back their forecasts for the coming decade. With valuations looking stretched, it seemed unlikely that the blockbuster 20%-plus stock returns of 2023 and 2024 would continue. A Morningstar roundup in January of predictions from investment firms forecast a range of 3.4% to 6.7% returns for U.S. equities over the next decade, and 3.7% to 5.3% for U.S. bonds. Those gains would be below historical stock averages, implying that investors should expect lower overall returns.The big debate now is whether Trump has upended the math. Trump's trade war is expected to lead to lower economic growth and create inflationary pressure on goods. And there's consternation over the end of \"American exceptionalism\" \u2014 the notion that the U.S. is the best place to invest, resulting in higher stock prices and lower bond yields.Worry is also creeping back into markets after the U.S. lost its last AAA credit rating following a downgrade by Moody's. Long-term Treasury yields have spiked with the 30-year bond above 5%, signaling weakening appetite for U.S. government debt.The bull case is that Trump will strike trade deals, the economy will get a lift from Federal Reserve rate cuts, and fiscal stimulus will be coming as the GOP pushes through tax cuts and deregulation. Throw in growth drivers like artificial intelligence and a domestic manufacturing bump, and the economy could keep rolling.Given the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook, focus on what you can control: your household balance sheet, income prospects, and building a portfolio that can carry you through retirement. A financial planner can help put it all together. Some planners charge by the hour or project, if you don't want an ongoing relationship and the 1% annual fee on a portfolio that many advisors charge.Bear in mind: Market expectations go hand-in-hand with longevity. Many people underestimate how long they might live \u2014 and, by extension, how long their money needs to last. A man who makes it to 65 will live to age 83, on average, while a 65-year-old woman will live to nearly 86, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There's also 46% chance that one member of a 65-year-old couple will live to 95.We can't all be above average (this isn't Lake Wobegon), but many financial firms urge investors to add a few years to their retirement plans, arguing that medical advances and other factors will prolong longevity. Lengthening life spans warrant consideration of a 35-year planning horizon in retirement, says Michael Conrath, chief retirement strategist at J.P.

Actively managed ETFs may be less tax-efficient, but they may still be better than mutual funds that often generate capital gains, even in years when the funds lose value.There are so many low-cost index funds that, if you're paying higher fees, there should be a good reason, says Adam Recker, senior managing director and head of equities at the Mather Group in Dallas. Don't pay 1% a year in fees for a closet index fund \u2014 one that purports to offer active management but closely tracks an index like the S&P 500. A worker contributing $10,000 a year to a 401(k) that charges 1% in fees will experience $222,000 in lost growth over 35 years compared with an account with 0% fees, according to a recent study from J. Price McNamara, an employee-benefits attorney.Diversify and Go AbroadDiversification offered scant rewards in recent years. All the action was in the S&P 500 and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which accounted for over half of the S&P 500's market-cap gain in both 2023 and 2024.But the story is changing: International stocks are beating the U.S. this year, the Mag Seven is no longer such a superstar, and there's a strong case for branching out beyond U.S. megacap tech \u2014 including small-caps, value, international, and other areas.A major consideration now is the dollar's slide, down 6% this year against a basket of major currencies. The dollar's loss of value has many causes. Some strategists see the greenback's slide as the start of a global shift to other markets and assets. If it continues, the case for diversification will grow, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, noting as of mid-May that European stocks are up 10% for the year, or 18% in dollar-denominated terms.Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, which oversees $447 billion in assets under management, says the firm now has a neutral position on U.S. equities, down from an overweight until early May. She recommends holding U.S. stocks in about the same proportion as the MSCI ACWI index, which has 64% in the U.S.That might seem like too little U.S. exposure, but exchange-traded funds such as iShares MSCI ACWI still tilt heavily to U.S. tech, with top holdings like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.com. Adding a bit more foreign exposure to your mix is like buying insurance against American exceptionalism withering, but that still leaves plenty of room to capitalize off U.S. growth companies. \"If you're an investor, you're buying companies, and our companies are remarkable,\" Nixon says.Many advisors recommend that investors devote between a quarter and a third of their equity portfolio to non-U.S. stocks. Consider adding some quality factors, focusing on companies with higher profitability and lower debt levels. The iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor, for instance, owns developed-world stocks like ASML Holding, Nestl\u00e9, Allianz, and Shell. Its 10-year annualized return of 6.6% beat the 5% annualized return of the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF.Diversification can help psychologically, too \u2014 if at least some of your holdings are in the green, you're less likely to panic and sell holdings. Gold, for instance, is up nearly 25% this year. Many advisors recommend around 5% of your portfolio in gold, which could be a bulwark against dollar weakness and geopolitical turmoil. ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares offer a convenient, liquid way to invest.While the classic 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds has many fans, a growing number of advisors recommend throwing in alternatives for uncorrelated returns. David McInnis, managing partner at Aristia Wealth Management in Alpharetta, Ga., suggests a 60/30/10 split, with 10% in alternatives like market-neutral and long-short funds and private credit. Some names he likes are AQR Style Premia Alternative fund and BlackRock Systemic Multi-Strategy. These are high-fee mutual funds, perhaps best suited for skittish investors; while they may be good at holding up when stocks fizzle, keep in mind their long-term returns aren't close to U.S. equities.Cash: Stay in the Goldilocks ZoneAmid high uncertainty, it's tempting to run for cover in cash. Avoid the temptation to bail out of the markets. Cash may be a portfolio savior in a market downturn, but you'll regret holding lots of cash in a snapback. Market recoveries can happen so fast that you're sure to lose out with bad timing.How much cash should you hold? Most advisors recommend that retirees keep at least a year's worth of portfolio withdrawals in cash \u2014 the amount you need to pull out to fund your expenses, after accounting for Social Security, pensions, and other income. This way, you aren't forced to withdraw money from a declining balance to pay the bills. Just as important, you won't have to sweat volatility if you know your near-term needs aren't subject to the vagaries of the market.One positive for cash now: The opportunity cost of holding it has shrunk. With high-yield savings accounts and money-market funds still yielding 4%, you won't be as penalized for holding a healthy cash cushion. \"You have to have enough so you can sleep at night,\" Schneider says. He generally keeps three-to-five years' worth of retired clients' living expenses in cash and high-quality bonds.Alternatives to cash may generate a bit more yield and can supplement withdrawals or expenses you might have over the next five years. Investments might include short-term bond ETFs like JPMorgan Limited Duration Bond and iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond.Also consider some inflation protection with Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. The \"real,\" or inflation-adjusted, yield on TIPS is around 2%, and the break-even inflation rate is 2.3%, says Brian Jacobs, investment strategist at Aptus Capital Advisors in the San Francisco Bay area. If inflation runs higher than that, TIPS will return more than Treasuries with similar maturities.A 60/40 investor could devote 10% to 15% of their fixed-income portfolio to TIPS, says Nixon. The tax treatment of TIPS can be complicated, so it's simpler to own them in tax-deferred retirement accounts. ETFs like Pimco 1-5 Year U.S. TIPS offer easier exposure. TIPS funds, unlike individual TIPS held to maturity, can lose money when rates rise. In 2022, the US TIPS index lost 11.8% as the Fed hiked rates by about four percentage points. Funds like Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities aim to minimize interest-rate risk.Bolster Other Income and Social SecurityWhile you can't control the market, you can control how much you spend and, to some extent, how long you work.If you're able to work even a few months more, it can take some pressure off your portfolio. Not only are you not drawing down your assets, but you are padding your nest egg. If you can delay Social Security, it can boost your benefit by 8% a year between your full retirement age \u2014 67 for everyone born in 1960 and later \u2014 and age 70.Once retired, taking less from your portfolio in a down market can help blunt the impact of stock losses. The so-called 4% rule holds that retirees can withdraw 4% of their portfolio every year, adjusted upward for inflation, and not run out of money over a 30-year retirement. While it was tested across many different scenarios and should hold up in a bear market, one strategy for belt-tightening is to forgo the annual inflation boost in years following market losses.When it comes to your portfolio, the best time to act is before things get choppy. \"The way to make peace with uncertainty is, one, have a plan ahead of time, and two, control the things we can control,\" Recker says.Write to Elizabeth O'Brien at elizabeth.obrien@barrons.comTo subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe",

    "descriptionText": "Some might be old enough to remember what it was like to switch from the Yellow Pages to Google. Another quantum leap forward is just around the corner.Alphabet, Google's parent company, does a lot of things well. Its YouTube and cloud computing are profitable businesses, and its Gmail and productivity apps are ubiquitous. There's plenty more in the works \u2014 camera sharing, 3-D conferencing, and artificial intelligence-driven video generation were demonstrated at the company's I/O Keynote Tuesday.But all that is peripheral to Google Search, which is still the dominant launchpad into the internet. And Alphabet intends to keep it that way--there's a reason why it's willing to pay Apple $20 billion a year to keep Google as the default search on iPhones.AI \u2014 as an alternative portal to the web \u2014 is an existential threat to that dominance. Google's doing everything it can to stay ahead of the curve and avoid obsolescence. But for the first time in decades, it has serious competition from the likes of ChapGPT, DeepSeek, and others. With about 90% of global searches currently, Google has a serious chunk of market share to lose.Even if Google wins the AI race, there's another problem \u2014 how to monetize it. Not only is AI more expensive to run, it's also not quite as easy to sell ads if you're accessing the web through an Amazon Alexa device or a virtual reality headset. That's one reason Google pitched the \"AI Ultra\" subscription plan yesterday, which would give access to the most advanced AI models. At a lofty $250 a month, that could be a tough sell for consumers who are used to the internet being free.Alphabet already trades at much lower valuation than, say, Microsoft or Tesla. It may yet win the AI war, but there's a risk that its cash cow will end up in the dustbin with an outdated six-inch thick phone book.- Brian Swint***Alphabet Unveils New Gadgets, Features Including AI SearchAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the Google I/O Keynote by detailing more than a dozen artificial intelligence models and research breakthroughs and over 20 AI products and features since the last I/O update, including AI mode for search and AI smart glasses.- The 'AI Mode' conversational chatbot for Google's search engine is available to all U.S. users. It still takes an extra step to access it from the search bar, but it's a symbolic move toward AI-driven search. AI start-ups ChatGPT and Perplexity have pressured Google's traditional search market. - Pichai announced its Gemini live camera and screen-sharing feature on Android and iOS, allowing users to point their cameras at an object and ask questions that Gemini will answer. And Google Beam 3-D videoconferencing is on the way later this year. - Google is working with eyeglass retailer Warby Parker to build AI-powered glasses with Android XR that are intended to be worn all day. Facebook parent Meta Platforms has already introduced Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and augmented-reality Orion glasses. - The next version of Google's AI video generation model, Veo 3, can also generate audio, sound effects and dialogue, and is available now. A clothing try-on feature coming in a few months lets shoppers upload their pictures to see what the outfits they want to buy would look like. What's Next: Accessing Google's new models and features isn't cheap. Google's new AI Ultra subscription plan with the highest usage limits will cost $249.99 a month and include Gemini models, the Flow AI filmmaking tool, a higher usage limit Notebook LM, and 30 terabytes of storage.- Angela Palumbo, Tae Kim, and Janet H. Cho***House Lawmakers Wrestle Over Tax Bill Despite Trump DemandsDespite President Donald Trump's demand that GOP lawmakers get on board with the tax bill, far-right members and blue state Republicans are still squabbling over things like Medicaid cuts that threaten the bill's passage.- House Speaker Mike Johnson can lose only three votes if all Democrats stick together in opposition. GOP Freedom Caucus members want deeper cuts to Medicaid than the bill proposes, while moderates from blue states want a larger federal deduction for state and local taxes. Trump told the blue state Republicans to drop it. - Rep. Mike Lawler (R, N.Y.), one of those blue state members, told reporters he was \"not budging,\" and Rep. Nick LaLota (R, N.Y.) also wants changes. House leadership recently proposed raising the SALT cap to $40,000, up from $30,000. Trump wants to extend his 2017 tax cuts. - Medicaid is a bigger sticking point. Trump, on Capitol Hill in closed-door meetings to promote the bill, excoriated members (using an expletive) not to tamper with the program. Instead, he instructed them to focus on weeding out alleged waste, fraud, and abuse. - The current proposal would expand work requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid, the health insurer to more than 70 million low-income and disabled Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said changes would save roughly $301 billion over 10 years by reducing enrollees. What's Next: The House Rules Committee plans to advance the bill in a vote today, and Johnson aims to pass the House bill before this Memorial Day weekend. That would kick-start work on the bill in the Senate, where it is expected to change significantly before a final vote this summer.- Joe Light and Janet H. Cho***Fed Presidents Warn Don't Expect Recession or Rate CutsThere's no U.S. recession in the forecast but no rate cut either, according to three Federal Reserve Bank presidents speaking at the Atlanta Federal Reserve's financial markets conference on Amelia Island Tuesday evening.- San Francisco's Mary Daly, Cleveland's Beth Hammack and Atlanta's Raphael Bostic each described a cautious approach shaped by uncertainty, not urgency. - \"We're in center position,\" Daly said. \"My reaction function is to stay in center position and be prepared to move agilely, but not abruptly or quickly when we don't need to, because we don't have enough information to really bring those confidence bands in.\" - \"I am a person of action,\" Hammack said. \"But right now, I think the best action we can take is to sit on our hands.\" Bostic was more definitive. \"I don't have a recession in my outlook,\" he said. What's Next: The three presidents all emphasized the limits of backward-looking data and the growing importance of anecdotal intelligence. Daly and Hammack added their banks are experimenting with machine learning and textual analysis to detect sentiment shifts faster than traditional economic indicators can capture.- Nicole Goodkind***Musk Is Cutting Back Political Spending and Focused on RobotaxisElon Musk is back in the headlines, confirming Tesla's plans to start a robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, next month, answering yes to a Bloomberg journalist's question whether he would be at the helm of the electric-vehicle maker in five years, and announcing he would cut his political spending.- Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2024 election to boost President Donald Trump and GOP priorities, told the Qatar Economic Forum he was going to spend less for now. \"I think I've done enough,\" he said. He might step back in at some point in the future. - Tesla's robotaxis will start with 10 vehicles with a goal of expanding to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rollout will go slowly at first before it is scaled up. Musk told CNBC he expects hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars on the road by the end of 2026. - Musk shrugged off concerns about Tesla sales, which fell 13% in the first quarter from a year ago and have shown continuing weakness, particularly in Europe. The auto business has \"already turned around,\" he told the Bloomberg forum in Qatar, and they see no problem with demand. - Musk donated more than $270 million to back Trump last year, and created controversy as Trump's advisor on slashing the federal government. He spends one to two days a week in Washington, and will be having dinner with Trump and meeting with cabinet officials this week, he told the Qatar audience. What's Next: Analysts have worried that Musk's political activities have tarnished Tesla's brand appeal, something Musk also brushes off, joking with the Qatar audience that people now buy Teslas because Musk is crazy. Asked if he regretted his political endeavors, Musk said \"I did what needed to be done.\"- Liz Moyer and Al Root***Home Prices Are Dropping But Buyers Aren't Budging, YetFor the real estate market, the bad news is that while the number of homes listed for sale this spring has jumped, costs remain prohibitive and buyers aren't returning with the same enthusiasm.

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineThis past week saw two tech titans fighting for attention with dueling developer conferences: Microsoft Build and Google I/O. Microsoft was talking to a business audience, and Alphabet's Google to its consumer base, but both companies were showing off AI \"agents.\" Early results show that the agents may not be ready to take on much responsibility.An agent is software that uses an AI language model to accomplish a series of complex tasks from a simple prompt, to some extent acting independently. Microsoft has launched an agent in its software development platform, GitHub, that can act like a junior-level developer. GitHub allows teams to write software code together and fix bugs in an organized way.The agent is still in development, but potential problems have emerged in the days since launch. Microsoft engineers have assigned bug fixes to the agent as a test, and the results are uneven, according to public repositories of the coding process. (Some of Microsoft's software is open source, so the records are public.)In one case, the AI agent made a bug fix in some software for iPhones late on Monday. On Tuesday morning, a Microsoft engineer came to work and discovered that there was an error in the agent's code. That engineer tried to get the agent to fix the problem with simple prompts like, \"fix the build error on apple platforms,\" as is intended by Microsoft.But those prompts failed to solve the issue, and other Microsoft engineers jumped in to try to get the agent's code to work. The prompts became increasingly more complex, and farther away from how Microsoft would like this agent to work. In all, 11 prompts to the agent from four different Microsoft employees didn't fix the problem.Early on Wednesday, non-Microsoft developers on GitHub got wind of this and other issues with GitHub's coding agent. \"How concerned should I be about AI agents being let loose on codebases like this?\" one developer asked on GitHub.\"We've all seen the pressure from Microsoft to include AI features and use AI in all kinds of ways. It's not just about making the product better, it's about keeping up with the AI hype cycle,\" another developer on GitHub said. \"Is the ROI even worth it?\"The skeptical comments are being met with enthusiastic thumbs-ups from other GitHub developers.Another Microsoft engineer jumped into the fray with an explanation: \"We're experimenting to understand the limits of what the tools can do today and preparing for what they'll be able to do tomorrow.\"As AI revenue piles up in Microsoft's Azure cloud unit, the company is making massive investments into AI software and services for its business customers. Microsoft has touted the capabilities of current AI agents.\"By testing in public repositories, we're gathering valuable feedback from both maintainers and the broader community about its capabilities and limitations,\" Microsoft told Barron's in a statement. \"We're rapidly incorporating this feedback to improve the agent's effectiveness in complex codebases, with developers always deciding what code gets merged.\"Write to Adam Levine at adam.levine@barrons.comThis content was created by Barron's, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.Here are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:META vs. MSFT: Which AI Superpower Is a Better Buy?Meta Platforms and Microsoft have evolved as artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses with significant investments in developing AI infrastructure and applications. While Meta Platform plans to invest between $64 billion and $72 billion, driven by Generative AI and core business needs, Microsoft expects capital expenditures to increase in the coming years to support growth in its cloud offerings and investments in AI infrastructure and training. Microsoft\u2019s investment in Open AI has been a catalyst in driving the adoption of Generative AI.According to IDC, the global AI infrastructure market is expected to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028. AI adoption is expected to grow exponentially as hyperscalers, cloud service providers, private companies and federal governments plan to deploy and leverage AI. The massive opportunity bodes well for both Meta Platforms and Microsoft.So, META or MSFT, which is a stronger pick now?The Case for Meta Platforms StockMeta Platforms focus on improving advertisers\u2019 return on ad spending is a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers.The launch of the new Generative Ads Recommendation model for ads ranking that is being used in Facebook Reels has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta Platforms also saw 30% more advertisers using AI creative tools. Improvements in META\u2019s recommendation system have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads over the past six months.Meta Platforms\u2019 focus on making Meta AI the leading personal AI with a deepening emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment is a key catalyst. The launch of Meta AI\u2019s standalone app is a noteworthy development in this regard. Growing sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses as well as Quest is noteworthy for META\u2019s prospects.The Case for Microsoft StockMicrosoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI in its applications. The company has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year. The Azure AI Foundry application and agent development hub has now been adopted by developers at more than 70,000 enterprises and digital-native companies.Microsoft's Azure AI Agent Service has been utilized by more than 10,000 organizations to build, deploy and scale agents. The company's Phi small language models have gained significant traction, with 38 million downloads to date. In the development space, GitHub Copilot's code review agent has handled more than eight million requests, while GitHub Copilot itself has surpassed 15 million users, representing more than fourfold growth year over year.Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to expand its global footprint with hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide and usage is increasing threefold compared to the previous year. Microsoft Copilot has proven instrumental in enhancing employee productivity and creativity, with data from the Work Trend Index research showcasing potential time savings of up to 10 hours per month.Microsoft is now extending Copilot\u2019s capabilities across its entire product spectrum, including Windows, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Edge. The adoption of Copilot Studio has been particularly strong, with more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of the Fortune 500, implementing the technology.META Shares Outperform MSFTMeta Platforms shares have outperformed Microsoft year to date. While META shares appreciated 12.5% Microsoft returned 7.5%. However, higher tariff announced on Liberation Day has negatively impacted Meta Platforms shares as compared with Microsoft.

Meta Platforms\u2019 average surprise of 17.3% is better than Microsoft\u2019s surprise of 5.21%, reflecting good quality of earnings beat on a consistent basis.Valuation: META is Cheaper Than MSFTBoth Meta Platforms and Microsoft are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D.In terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, Meta Platforms shares are trading at 8.57X, lower than Microsoft\u2019s 10.9X.ConclusionAlthough both Microsoft and Meta Platforms are leveraging AI to boost their prospects Microsoft is better positioned compared with META given strong adoption of Copilot, Azure AI services and a rise in AI Copilot business.Currently, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), making the stock a stronger pick compared with Meta Platforms, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The regulator is now asking for industry feedback on those commitments.The European Union executive had started investigating how Microsoft offers its software to customers following a complaint from rival Slack Technologies. Germany's Alfaview also complained.Nanna-Louise Linde, Microsoft's vice president of European government affairs, said in a blog post on Friday that the commitments \"represent a clear and complete resolution to the concerns raised by our competitors and will provide European customers with more choices.\"Sabastian Niles, president and chief legal officer of Slack's owner Salesforce, said that the company would carefully scrutinize Microsoft's offer.\"The European Commission's announcement of a market test further affirms that Microsoft's anticompetitive practices with Teams have harmed competition and require a binding, enforceable, and effective remedy,\" he said.Write to Edith Hancock at edith.hancock@wsj.com",

The company has also pledged to offer platforms that compete with Teams better interoperability with Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to facilitate using competing products.Microsoft also said that if the commitments become binding it will align its worldwide suites offers and pricing with its EU plans, the commission said. The regulator is now asking for industry feedback on those commitments.The European Union executive had started investigating how Microsoft offers its software to customers following a complaint from rival Slack Technologies. Germany's Alfaview also complained.Nanna-Louise Linde, Microsoft's vice president of European government affairs, said in a blog post on Friday that the commitments \"represent a clear and complete resolution to the concerns raised by our competitors and will provide European customers with more choices.\"Write to Edith Hancock at edith.hancock@wsj.com",

Microsoft 365 Copilot and Windows have been modernized for the agentic era with a native Model Context Protocol registry, letting agents access diverse data sources and execute actions across applications.NVIDIA NASDAQ:NVDA CEO Jensen Huang noted Azure's supercomputer power has accelerated 40 in two years, while Kevin Scott said new reasoning models enable agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks and OpenAI's Sam Altman called this a rare technological shift. Build also introduced Microsoft Discovery, a science-focused platform for reasoning and research. Why It Matters: Enterprises can now deploy scalable, customizable AI agents across environments, reducing development friction and accelerating digital transformation as demand for automated software solutions soars.",

The retailer maintained its outlook for 2.8% growth in full-year sales, with CFO Richard McPhail stating the company has no plans to raise prices despite the renewed threat of tariffs.The session followed a modest uptick on Monday that extended the S&P 500\u2019s winning streak to six consecutive sessions, its longest since a nine-day stretch earlier this month. While gains were incremental, they capped a sharp rebound that has left the benchmark index just 3% below its all-time high.The rally has persisted in spite of persistent macro headwinds, including concerns over the economic fallout from elevated tariffs and renewed recession fears. Investors also largely shrugged off Moody\u2019s downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating, which highlighted rising fiscal pressures and a deteriorating debt outlook.Retail investors \u201cbuy the dip\u201dRetail investors surged into the market on Monday, shrugging off Moody\u2019s downgrade of the US credit rating with record-setting dip-buying activity. According to data from JPMorgan\u2019s trading desk, individual investors purchased a net $4.1 billion worth of equities by 12:30 pm ET\u2014the highest intraday total ever recorded at that time and a statistically extreme move, exceeding 11 standard deviations from the norm. By the close of trading, net retail purchases reached $5.4 billion.Retail traders accounted for 36% of total market volume during the session, also a record, JPMorgan noted. Their aggressive buying helped lift the S&P 500, which had been down nearly 1% at its lows, to a marginal 0.09% gain, marking the index\u2019s sixth straight day of gains.The buying spree followed Moody\u2019s decision to cut the US sovereign credit rating by one notch from Aaa to Aa1, citing escalating fiscal deficits and the rising cost of debt amid elevated interest rates. While institutional investors have grown increasingly cautious, concerned about recession risks and capital flight amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven protectionist stance, retail buyers have continued to lean into volatility.The \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d approach has become entrenched among retail investors this year. In April, amid escalating tariff tensions, they poured $40 billion into equities\u2014a new monthly record\u2014highlighting a willingness to step in even as macroeconomic uncertainty and political headwinds persist.",

    "descriptionText": "OpenAI is venturing into hardware with its $6.5 billion acquisition of Sir Jony Ive's io, aiming to launch AI-powered companions by 202627 that blend unobtrusive design with real-world awareness.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities calls physical AI the next critical trend and sees the Ive partnership as a strategic play to marry leading AI models with Apple NASDAQ:AAPL -grade industrial design. Prototypes, according to Ming-Chi Kuo, pack cameras and microphones for environmental detection in a screen-less form factor roughly the size of an iPod Shufflewearable around the neck and leveraging connected PCs or smartphones for displays. Kuo's industry checks point to mass production in 2027, with assembly outside China to minimize geopolitical risk.The deal injects design heft into Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT - and SoftBank-backed OpenAI, which paid $5 billion in stock and expanded its existing 23% io stake valued at $1.5 billion. Altman and Ive emphasize stealth to prevent rivals from cloning their concept and reference Alan Kay's dictum that serious software players must craft their own hardware. This pivot follows Google's NASDAQ:GOOG I/O AI showcase and underscores OpenAI's bid to shift the narrative back in its favor.Why It Matters Investors should note that integrating cutting-edge AI with premium hardware could unlock higher margins and create stickier consumer offerings, elevating OpenAI's competitive moat against Big Tech's software-only strategy.Investors will look for prototype demos at year-end events and monitor official launch timing as the company refines specs ahead of a late-2026 debut.",

In April, CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs.Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries.Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a \"universal AI agent.\"At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time.The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat.Meanwhile, Google is growing other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by \"millions\" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.",

    "descriptionText": "By Adam LevineOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and announced that his company is acquiring io, a start-up led by Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer. The merger unites the premier AI company with a hardware team assembled by one of the world's premier designers. The goal? To make a new device for the AI era.The merger quickly led to talk about the end of smartphones, and Apple stock finished Wednesday down 2.3%. (Apple shares are flat in mid-day trading Thursday.)Investors should take a step back \u2014 and consider the history. Well-funded and big-name partnerships often end in failure. And, with a few exceptions, ex-Apple employees don't have a great record of success after leaving Apple.Ive departed Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm, LoveForm. All of LoveForm's work has been in the ultra-luxury class. So far, its product designs are a jacket that starts at $2,000, a $60,000 limited edition turntable, and some work for Ferrari.LoveForm has also designed a logo and emblem for King Charles of the United Kingdom, and it has a partnership with Airbnb.LoveForm will provide design services to OpenAI, but this deal doesn't include buying that company, which will continue in its current form. Instead, OpenAI is buying a LoveForm spinoff named io. Led by Ive and three other ex-Apple employees, io is a product-focused group with hardware and software engineers.What form their device will take is still a mystery, but io does have a prototype. \"The first one we've been working on, I think has just completely captured our imagination,\" Ive said in the merger announcement video.\"Jony called one day and said 'This is the best work our team has ever done,'\" Altman, not known for soft-sells, said in the video. \"Jony recently gave me one of the prototypes of the devices for the first time to take home and I've been able to live with it. And I think it is the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen.\"The pair offered no further details on what the product would look like or do.We can speculate: An \"AI device\" is a group of new form factors that will perhaps one day replace the smartphone as people's primary device. Meta, Google-parent Alphabet, and Snap are working on glasses that will have augmented reality lenses and work with voice commands. Meta and Snap already have products in the category with limited functionality. Google just debuted an experimental version of its AI glasses in a bug-filled live demo at its I/O developers conference. Apple's version is something like Vision Pro, but much less expensive and bulky.Indeed, Apple knows that AI poses a threat to its hardware. During his testimony at Google's antitrust trial earlier this month, Apple executive Eddy Cue said that because of AI, \"you may not need an iPhone 10 years from now.\"So far, though, AI-driven products have had a poor track record. One attempt in this new category, the Humane AI Pin, already failed. Humane was started in 2018 by two ex-Apple employees and boasted investments from Microsoft, SoftBank, Qualcomm, Tiger Global, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, LG, and Altman.The result in 2024 was a wearable device that operated with voice commands, offloading most of the functionality to AI in the cloud. Influential product reviewer Marques Brownlee called it \"The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed...For Now.\" The device was plagued by numerous technical and functional issues, and was subject to a recall. It's now been discontinued.Ive and Altman are surely well aware of the Humane failure, and they may have another form factor that isn't glasses or a pin. But they will run up against the same set of challenges. At least at first, the AI will have to be cloud-based, which means the device will stop working when off-network, and it may lead to latency even when connected.The pitch from AI-device start-ups is that we spend too much time looking down at our phones instead of being engaged in our surroundings, and that we need to be freed from our screens.

    "descriptionText": "For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL \u2013 May 20, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Moody's MCO, Broadcom AVGO, Microsoft MSFT and CoreWeave CRWV.U.S. Stocks Brush Off Moody's, Echo Past Tech BoomsIn poker, a \"tell\" is a player's subtle character or demeanor change that can unknowingly tip off an opponent and provide crucial information about how strong a hand they may have. The best and most powerful market tell on Wall Street is price action versus news. When the market gets hit with bad news, how fast it rebounds can be a tell for savvy investors.Friday, after the market closed, the Nasdaq and other major US indices fell more than 1% after Moody's credit rating agency downgraded US debt based on the rising US budget deficit. Though stocks suffered a knee-jerk reaction Friday evening, cooler heads prevailed Monday, and stocks shook off the bad news. Such action is a hallmark of a bull market. Savvy investors should ask themselves, \"If bad news can't bring down stocks, what is likely to occur when there is no news?\"Late 90s Internet Precedents Mimics PresentBeSpoke Investment Group (@bespokeinvest) posted a fascinating chart recently that compared the releases of Netscape versus ChatGPT. The precedent, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq, is very similar and provides a strong precedent. After all, the release of the Netscape web browser jump-started the internet boom in the late 1990s, while the ChatGPT chatbot release brought large language models (LLMs) to the masses and started the AI revolution.The overlayed chart shows the current Nasdaq tracking the late 1990s precedent very closely, rising 74.18% through 617 days, while the 90s example tracked 93.42% through the same time. Beyond the price action in the Nasdaq, the performance in individual AI names like Broadcom , Microsoft and CoreWeave shows that the party may just be getting started.S&P 500 Index Explodes to the Upside, Likely Not FinishedIf there's anything baseball's steroid era taught, it's that power and distance are correlated. Muscular hitters like Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa smashed records and often hit baseballs out of the stadium. The same metaphor holds for stocks. The S&P 500 Index screamed higher by more than 19% in just 27 days following a warming of trade tensions between the US and China.Considering that S&P 500 returns are historically ~10%, most amateur investors may assume that the market is done moving higher for the year. However, historical data from Ryan Detrick (@ryandetrick) of Carson Investment Research shows us that the exact opposite is true. In fact, since 1950, the S&P 500 Index has been higher one year later 100% of the time when it gains more than 19% in 27 trading days.Bottom LineOn Wall Street, just like in poker, observing the subtle tells can be incredibly insightful. The market's resilient reaction to the Moody's downgrade, coupled with the historical precedent of the late 1990s, signals a bullish market ahead.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

QuoteLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for Okta prior to this announcement:Factors to Note for OktaOKTA\u2019s expanding product portfolio, especially in security and identity governance, is expected to have helped it win clients, driving top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. It exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 with 19,650 customers and $4.215 billion in remaining performance obligations, reflecting strong growth prospects for subscription revenues. Customers with more than $100 thousand in Annual Contract Value increased 7% year over year to 4,800.Continued momentum from new products like Okta Identity Governance, Privileged Access, Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI, Workforce Identity Suites and Auth for GenAI is expected to have been a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter. More than 20% of the fiscal fourth-quarter bookings came from these products. The trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. Okta Identity Governance, in particular, has grown to more than 1,300 customers contributing more than $100 million in annual contract value within just two years of launch. This rapid adoption is expected to drive bookings to grow further in the to-be-reported quarter.Okta is expected to benefit from a rich partner base that includes the likes of Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler.\u00a0Okta\u2019s increasing strength in its partner ecosystem, particularly through its relationship with Amazon Web Services, supported its security efforts.

    "descriptionText": "By Nate WolfAfter a year of lagging behind its Magnificent Seven peers, Microsoft stock has plenty of room to rise in the year ahead, Wall Street analysts say.On Thursday, analysts at both Citi and Evercore issued positive outlooks for Microsoft, citing the strength of the tech giant's Azure cloud-computing arm, the payoff from its enterprise artificial-intelligence investments, and the cost savings of recent job cuts.Citi, which has a Buy rating on the stock, lifted its target price to $540 from $480 \u2014 a roughly 20% increase from Wednesday's close of $450.44. Evercore maintained its $500 price target and Outperform rating ahead of the investment bank's Microsoft 360 Day event on May 20.The stamps of approval from Wall Street are welcome news for Microsoft as it battles to keep pace with other megacap tech stocks.Over the past year, the company's 12-month price-to-earnings ratio has gained just 7%, compared with 29% for Roundhill's Magnificent Seven exchange-traded fund, according to data from FactSet.Trimming costs could help. Microsoft said Tuesday it will reduce its workforce by around 3%, equaling several thousand employees. A company spokesperson told Barron's the cuts would \"best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.\"Citi analysts see the layoffs as a positive, estimating they could save Microsoft roughly 4%, or $2.5 billion a year, in operating expenses.Meanwhile, the days of massive capital spending growth associated with AI infrastructure might finally be over, Evercore's analysts noted. They predict year-over-year capital expenditure growth has likely peaked. All that past investment now has the potential to pay off down the road.\"While the cost burden related to new AI infrastructure is being felt today, the revenue associated with these investments will be recognized for years to come,\" the Evercore analysts wrote.The AI boom could be particularly helpful for Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business, which had seen growth fluctuate in past quarters.At the start of the month, Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, buoyed by 33% year-over-year growth for Azure.

    "descriptionText": "By Tae KimCoreWeave shares were wavering in early trading Thursday after the AI cloud firm reported better-than-expected revenue for its initial quarter as a public company.While stocks often react to short-term news in the wake of quarterly results, CoreWeave offered some long-term good news for investors: it's starting to win significant business from major technology companies beyond its largest customer Microsoft.Late Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter with a loss of $1.49 per share. Revenue came in at $981.6 million, up 420% year-over-year, which was above analysts' expectations for $857 million.CoreWeave said it expects revenue in the current quarter to range from $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion versus the $988 million consensus. For the full year, the company expects revenue to range from $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, compared with the $4.66 billion estimate. The company also guided its 2025 capex to a range of $20 billion to $23 billion, which was higher than analysts' $19.3 billion estimate, according to FactSet.CoreWeave stock has wavered from positive to negative territory in the wake of the earnings report. Shares are currently up 0.7% in late-morning trading on Thursday.The stock is volatile on a day-to-day basis and had rallied 6.6% on Wednesday heading into the earnings report.\"Demand for our platform is robust and accelerating as AI leaders seek the highly performant AI cloud infrastructure required for the most advanced applications,\" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in a press release. \"We are scaling as fast as possible to capture that demand.\"In an interview with Barron's after the earnings call, Intrator said he is optimistic about the future prospects of a new hyperscaler customer that was signed in the first quarter. While he wouldn't name the new customer, the CoreWeave website now shows Google as a customer, which hasn't been disclosed in the past. Intrator also said that the faster Nvidia innovates on new GPUs, the better it is for CoreWeave as they are better equipped to quickly bring the new technology to customers.In the company's 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, CoreWeave also revealed it has entered into an agreement for additional services worth up to $4 billion through April 2029 with OpenAI.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated his Buy Rating on CoreWeave, citing the company's strong revenue outlook and customer wins. The \"top AI players keep knocking on CRWV's door,\" he wrote. \"We see no sign of AI compute tailwinds easing up soon & see CRWV as a multi-yr winner.\"Not everyone was positive about CoreWeave's first quarter. Skeptics pointed to the high level of interest and depreciation expenses that made up 72% of revenue in the quarter, reflecting CoreWeave's high risk business model that uses large amounts of debt and capital expenditures.

    "descriptionText": "Brazilian reforestation startup re.green has obtained 80 million reais ($14.13 million) in financing from state development bank BNDES, it said on Monday, in a deal that also involved lender Bradesco BMFBOVESPA:BBDC3 as a financial intermediary.The deal is similar to a 160 million real deal announced by Mombak last month, which marked the first reforestation project backed by Brazil's 10 billion real \"New Climate Fund\" unveiled in 2023 to finance climate-related projects.The deal comes as Brazil's nascent carbon market quickly gains ground and attracts interest from private investors and lenders such as Bradesco and Santander BME:SAN , which acted as an intermediary for Mombak.Some restoration startups have complained of difficulty getting loans to reduce capital costs and finance operations, as many investors still see it as risky.\"We have a mantra that is de-risking, which is how we will, over time, reduce uncertainty and bring more confidence to our market,\" re.green Chief Executive Thiago Picolo said in an interview.\"In our case, we now have the first disbursement from BNDES, also involving Bradesco for the first time. So it is a series of steps that reduce uncertainty, increase confidence, and facilitate fundraising.\"Re.green buys degraded land from farmers and ranchers or partners with them to replant native species in the Amazon rainforest and in Brazil's coastal Atlantic rainforest.By turning degraded land into forests, the company is working to generate \"carbon credits\" that companies can buy to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.The startup has a deal with Microsoft NASDAQ:MSFT to restore forests and is backed by Brazilian billionaire Joao Moreira Salles and asset managers such as Dynamo and Gavea, founded by former Brazilian central bank governor Arminio Fraga.The BNDES financing \"shows that we have a powerful tool to enable investments in the recovery of degraded areas in the country,\" said the state development bank's head, Aloizio Mercadante.\"It confirms the great power of this fund made available by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for BNDES to decisively fight the effects of climate change in our country,\" he added.The bank's program is part of Brazil's 2015 commitment to restoring 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) of its native forests by 2030, which Lula reaffirmed last year.($1 = 5.6632 reais)",

    "descriptionText": "Microsoft Corporation NASDAQ:MSFT and OpenAI have announced that\u00a0they are looking to\u00a0 reset their partnership . The reset is the latest chapter in a story that\u2019s been building between the two companies for the last six years. In\u00a0this case, it should be profitable for MSFT stock . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI started in 2019 with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft.\u00a0Over the next several years, that investment grew to over\u00a0 $13 billion , giving\u00a0Microsoft access to OpenAI\u2019s\u00a0 ChatGPT generative AI program .\u00a0In that time, Microsoft built its network of AI agents (i.e., Copilots) that ran on top of ChatGPT.This relationship vaulted Microsoft to the forefront of the AI race, and shareholders were the beneficiaries.\u00a0MSFT stock has delivered a\u00a0 total return of over 140% in the last five years.However, since 2023, the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft has become more strained, starting with OpenAI\u2019s decision to fire Sam Altman in December 2022 . At that point, the company\u2019s partnership was yielding positive benefits for both sides . But it also crystallized the idea that the partnership would have to evolve or end.Breaking Up Is Hard to DoIn January 2025, OpenAI and Microsoft seemed to be heading for a messy breakup . At that time, Microsoft confirmed that it was no longer going to be OpenAI\u2019s sole cloud provider . However, OpenAI was making a \u201c new, large commitment \u201d to Microsoft\u2019s AI cloud computing platform, Azure .OpenAI was planning to place its business under the control of a for-profit business . That plan has now been abandoned.\u00a0However, the company\u2019s goals of being a\u00a0public company haven\u2019t ended, and it will now\u00a0be financed by none other than Microsoft .That\u2019s right. While the terms of the new funding aren\u2019t completely clear, it appears that OpenAI will be using some of the $13 billion from Microsoft to fund an initial public offering (IPO) . But the plot thickens. Microsoft is expected to have an undefined level of equity in OpenAI\u2019s new business. However, reports are saying that Microsoft may be willing to reduce its equity stake if OpenAI allows Microsoft to have access to new technology developed by OpenAI after the 2030 cutoff .This would be a key concession from OpenAI and it would be yet another reason for long-term investors to be bullish on MSFT stock . [content-module:TradingView|NASDAQ:MSFT] The OpenAI News Allows MSFT Shareholders to Focus on the Bigger PictureMicrosoft stock is up about 3% in a week when the bulls returned to Wall Street. That\u2019s far below the returns of other technology stocks like NVIDIA Corp. NASDAQ:NVDA and Apple Inc. NASDAQ:AAPL that have gained 15% and 7% , respectively.However, Microsoft had less to catch up on. Over the last month, MSFT stock is up 18.9% . This cements the notion that Microsoft is a tariff-proof stock . The company will have some exposure to tariffs with its Xbox system . But overall, the company\u2019s software products are immune to tariff concerns .That said, the company has trimmed \u00a0its workforce by 3% in the last week. Those cuts, which included many management positions, aren\u2019t being made because of AI efficiencies. Microsoft may be trying to get ahead of what it perceives as a weaker environment for consumer spending on items like video game consoles and personal computers.At 36x earnings , MSFT stock is trading at a slight premium to its historical averages and near the top of its 52-week range. Those are two reasons MSFT stock hasn\u2019t climbed\u00a0even\u00a0after delivering\u00a0stellar earnings. However, the Microsoft and OpenAI reset is another reason investors are bullish on MSFT stock .Where Should You Invest $1,000 Right Now?Before you make your next trade, you'll want to hear this.MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.Our team has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and none of the big name stocks were on the list.They believe these five stocks are the five best companies for investors to buy now...See The Five Stocks Here",

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Factors Likely to Influence Salesforce\u2019s Q1 ResultsSalesforce appears well-positioned to report strong first-quarter results, driven by its strategic focus on digital transformation and cloud solutions. With businesses globally undergoing digital overhauls, Salesforce's commitment to aligning its product offerings with customer needs is likely to have boosted its revenues for the quarter.The growing demand for generative AI-enabled cloud solutions has been a major catalyst for Salesforce. By embedding generative AI tools across its products, the company not only enhances customer engagement but also strengthens its competitive position in the customer relationship management space. This forward-thinking approach might have significantly contributed to its top-line growth during the to-be-reported quarter.Salesforce\u2019s ability to deepen relationships with leading brands across industries and expand its reach in key geographic markets remains a cornerstone of its growth strategy. The company\u2019s increasing footprint in the public sector is likely to have provided a further boost, unlocking new growth opportunities during the first quarter.The acquisitions of Spiff, Own and Zoomin have been pivotal in enhancing Salesforce's capabilities and diversifying its revenue base. These additions are likely to have driven higher subscription revenues, particularly across its core cloud services. Salesforce\u2019s key cloud offerings, including Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data, are expected to have delivered robust growth.Our first-quarter revenue estimates for Sales, Service, Platform & Other, Marketing & Commerce and Data cloud services are pegged at $2.14 billion, $2.34 billion, $1.84 billion, $1.35 billion and $1.54 billion, respectively. We expect revenues of approximately $9.21 billion and $518.8 million for the Subscription and Support segment and the Professional Services division, respectively.The ongoing cost restructuring initiative is likely to have boosted Salesforce\u2019s profitability in the first quarter. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 33.1%, mainly driven by an improved gross margin and the benefits of cost restructuring initiatives, which include the trimming of the workforce and a reduction in office spaces.CRM\u2019s Price Performance & ValuationOver the past year, Salesforce shares have risen 1.4%, underperforming the Zacks Computer \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 10.4%. Compared to its peers, CRM stock has also underperformed other enterprise software makers, including SAP SE SAP, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT. Over the past year, shares of SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have gained 53.1%, 26.7% and 6%, respectively.One-Year Price Return PerformanceNow, let\u2019s look at the value Salesforce offers investors at the current levels. CRM stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/S of 6.48X compared with the industry\u2019s 9.25X.CRM stock also trades at a discounted multiple compared with SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. At present, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have P/S multiples of 8.38X, 6.77X and 10.87X, respectively.Investment Thesis for Salesforce StockSalesforce is the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management industry, consistently outpacing rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Gartner\u2019s annual rankings reaffirm its top position year after year. Its ability to maintain this dominance stems from its expansive product suite, seamless integrations and innovative approach to enterprise solutions.Strategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in strengthening its market position. The $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack in 2021 significantly enhanced its collaboration capabilities, making Salesforce a comprehensive enterprise software provider. More recently, the $1.9-billion acquisition of Own Company in 2024 bolstered its data protection and AI capabilities, a move that aligns with growing enterprise priorities around security and automation.Salesforce\u2019s AI initiatives further cement its leadership. Since introducing Einstein GPT in March 2023, the company has expanded its AI-driven functionalities across its entire ecosystem. This technology enhances automation, streamlines workflows and improves customer interactions, giving Salesforce a significant advantage as AI adoption accelerates across industries.Additionally, Salesforce is positioned to benefit from the continued rise in worldwide IT spending. Gartner projects global IT spending to reach $5.61 trillion in 2025, implying a 9.8% year-over-year increase. Enterprise software spending is expected to grow even faster, rising 14.2% year over year. As digital transformation remains a top priority for businesses, Salesforce is well-positioned to capture a substantial share of these increasing budgets.Conclusion: Hold CRM Stock Ahead of Q1 ResultsThe company\u2019s leadership in customer relationship management, aggressive AI expansion and increasing enterprise IT spending trends create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Its ability to deliver earnings growth despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties makes the stock worth holding.This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

    "descriptionText": "CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV recently reported first-quarter 2025 results, wherein revenues of $981.6 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% and jumped 420% year over year.Following the earnings announcement on May 14, shares of CRWV have gained over 19% and closed last trading session at $80.30. Since beginning trading on March 28, CRWV stock has more than doubled from its initial opening price of $39.\u00a0With substantial gains, the question is whether investors should still remain invested in CRWV stock or book profits and exit. Let\u2019s address this question by evaluating the company\u2019s latest quarterly performance and long-term prospects.CRWV\u2019s Q1 Earnings SnapshotCRWV\u2019s first-quarter loss per share of $1.49 came in much wider than a loss of 62 cents in the year-ago quarter. Loss per share includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense for awards with a liquidity-event performance-based vesting condition, which was satisfied at IPO.\u00a0Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $149.6 million compared with $23.6 million a year ago. Revenue backlog, inclusive of remaining performance obligations and other amounts the company estimates will be recognized as revenues in future periods under committed customer contracts, was $259 billion, rising 63% year over year.Management inked a strategic partnership with OpenAI for about $11.9 billion while adding several new enterprise customers and a hyperscaler client. It has signed expansion agreements with many customers, including a $4 billion expansion with a big AI-enterprise customer. CRWV added that the $4 billion expansion agreement signed with a big AI client will be reflected in revenue backlog beginning in the current quarter.Total operating expenses were $1 billion compared with $171.8 million in the year-ago quarter. This was inclusive of a one-time stock-based compensation expense recognized upon completion of the IPO. Adjusted operating income was $162.6 million, up 550% year over year, while adjusted operating margin was 17%, up from 13% in the year-ago quarter.Where is CRWV Headed From Here?Increasing demand for AI-cloud infrastructure bodes well. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been developed to scale, support, and accelerate GenAI. CRWV also highlights that its infrastructure and cloud services are purpose-built and highly optimized for AI workloads, unlike traditional cloud providers whose solutions were originally designed for web-scale applications and are hindered by legacy architectures. It also unveiled next generation of its CoreWeave AI object storage. This is purpose-built for training and inference, offering a production-ready, scalable solution integrated with Kubernetes.In the first quarter earnings call, CRWV highlighted that AI is forecasted to have a global economic impact of $20 trillion by 2030, while the total addressable market is anticipated to increase to $400 billion by 2028. Apart from scaling capacity and getting adequate financing for infrastructure, CRWV is also expanding its go-to-market capabilities.CoreWeave now boasts a growing data center network with 33 data centers across the United States and Europe, supported by 420 megawatts of active power. Moreover, the buyout of the Weights and Biases acquisition has added 1,400 AI labs and enterprises as clients for CoreWeave.CRWV also works with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to implement the latter\u2019s GPU technologies at scale. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems.Driven by healthy momentum, CRWV expects full-year 2025 revenues to be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $800 million and $830 million. For the second quarter, CRWV projects revenues to be between $1.06 billion and $1.1 billion. Adjusted operating income is forecasted to be between $140 million and $170 million.Challenges Aplenty for CRWVManagement\u2019s commentary surrounding higher capital expenditures is likely to have unnerved investors. CRWV expects capex to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for 2025 due to accelerated investment in the platform to meet customer demand. The company anticipates stock-based compensation to remain slightly higher in 2025 for the grants issued pertaining to the IPO. Higher capex can be a concern if revenue does not keep up required pace to sustain such high capital intensity, especially in a macro environment where AI demand cycles could fluctuate due to competitive pricing and regulatory changes.High interest expenses could weigh on profitability. In the first quarter, interest expense came in at $264 million, topping expectations. This was attributed to changes in vendor payment terms. The company now guides interest expense to remain elevated, at $260-$300 million in the current quarter. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation.CoreWeave faces tough competition in the AI cloud infrastructure space, which boasts behemoths like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform together dominate more than half of the cloud infrastructure services market. This is likely to have acted as a headwind. CoreWeave\u2019s 77% of total revenues in 2024 came from the top two customers. This intense customer concentration is a major risk, especially if the client migrates, the revenue impact could be material. Apart from this evolving trade policy, macro uncertainty and volatility remain additional headwinds.CRWV Stock Performance vs PeersCRWV shares have gained 126.7% in the past month. CRWV has significantly outperformed the 29.6% growth of the Zacks Internet Software industry and the 15.3% increase of the S&P 500 composite. The broader Computer and Technology Sector has risen 22.6% over the same time frame.The company has outpaced its peers like Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft and Amazon shares have gained 26.5% and 22.9%, respectively, in the same time frame.Should You Stay Invested in CRWV Stock?Staying invested in CRWV stock appears prudent for now due to its strong revenue growth prospects amid surging demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure. Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. The company's massive $259 billion revenue backlog and expanding data center footprint position it well for sustained growth.Despite near-term challenges, such as high capex and customer concentration, its differentiated AI-optimized platform offers a competitive edge. Nonetheless, competition from behemoths is a major concern.CRWV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates that investors should wait for a better entry point.

The latest catalyst for the stock is news that the company is likely to avoid fines from the European Union\u2019s (EU) antitrust case regarding Microsoft Teams . [content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:MSFT] At issue were allegations that Microsoft had abused its\u00a0 market dominance by incorporating Microsoft Teams into its Office suite, which includes signature applications such as Word, Excel, and Outlook. Microsoft has proposed offering the Office suite without Teams at a lower price than when Teams is included.In a blog post, Microsoft VP for European Government Affairs Nanna-Louise Linde described the proposal as a \u201cclear and complete resolution\u201d to its rivals\u2019 concerns and that Europeans would have more choice. However, the EU says it will seek feedback from Microsoft rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer. Interested parties have a month to provide feedback.The First Successful Attack on Microsoft\u2019s Walled Garden?This case has been ongoing since 2020, so it\u2019s not top-of-mind for many investors. However, lawsuits of any duration can weigh on earnings expectations. Microsoft has already paid the EU more than 2 billion euros, or roughly $2.67 billion, over the past several years. So at a time when earnings may be under pressure, it\u2019s good for Microsoft to put this case behind it.That\u2019s why, based on the headline proposal alone, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder why this should take so long. The price difference between the two suites is 8 euros, or about $9. While the headline draws attention, it\u2019s the details that make the story more compelling.Under Microsoft\u2019s proposal , competitors would be able to interoperate with certain Microsoft products and services for specific functions. They would also be able to embed Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in their own products and integrate their products into Microsoft\u2019s productivity applications.That\u2019s significant because the Windows operating system dominates the market and has increasingly drawn the ire of competitors for creating a \u201cwalled garden\u201d effect because it lacks open communication with other platforms.This reputation has been amplified with the introduction of Teams and, more recently, its AI initiatives with OpenAI . The deal with the EU, which would span 10 years, is one step toward, perhaps, a more open and inviting Office suite.Does MSFT Stock Have Short-Term Momentum?Like many technology stocks, Microsoft stock gapped up sharply after its earnings report on May 1. However, the stock was already off the 52-week low it made in March and April. Microsoft has been experiencing positive momentum as analysts are bullish about the company\u2019s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing . [content-module:Forecast|NASDAQ:MSFT] However, naysayers believe much of that growth is priced in, and MSFT stock is headed back to its April lows. The fact that the stock is trading at overbought levels reinforces that. A pullback on May 21 stopped its move to the all-time high it made last summer. It may also end a seven-day win streak and break the stock\u2019s momentum.Further support for a move lower is the stock\u2019s P/E ratio around 36x, which is a slight premium to its historical average.

    "descriptionText": "Microsoft envisions a future where any company's artificial intelligence agents can work together with agents from other firms and have better memories of their interactions, its chief technologist said on Sunday ahead of the company's annual software developer conference.Microsoft is holding its Build conference in Seattle on May 19, where analysts expect the company to unveil its latest tools for developers building AI systems.Speaking at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, ahead of the conference, Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott told reporters and analysts the company is focused on helping spur the adoption of standards across the technology industry that will let agents from different makers collaborate. Agents are AI systems that can accomplish specific tasks, such as fixing a software bug, on their own.Scott said that Microsoft is backing a technology called Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source protocol introduced by Google-backed Anthropic. Scott said MCP has the potential to create an \"agentic web\" similar to the way hypertext protocols that helped spread the internet in the 1990s.\"It means that your imagination gets to drive what the agentic web becomes, not just a handful of companies that happen to see some of these problems first,\" Scott said.Scott also said that Microsoft is trying to help AI agents have better memories of things that users have asked them to do, noting that, so far, \"most of what we're building feels very transactional.\"But making an AI agent's memory better costs a lot of money because it requires more computing power. Microsoft is focusing on a new approach called structured retrieval augmentation, where an agent extracts short bits of each turn in a conversation with a user, creating a roadmap to what was discussed.\"This is a core part of how you train a biological brain - you don't brute force everything in your head every time you need to solve a particular problem,\" Scott said.",

While enthusiasm is high, the question remains: Is this a sustainable uptrend or a short-lived bounce?Notably, despite this momentum, the IonQ stock still trades at a steep 35.5% discount from its 52-week high, raising a critical question for forward-looking investors: Is the post-earnings run just the beginning, or is the upside already priced in?IONQ Share\u2019s Price Performance Post Q1\u00a0Solid Start to 2025, But Profitability Remains ElusiveThe first-quarter 2025 results of IonQ, a pioneering force in quantum computing and networking, painted a mixed yet promising picture. Revenues were $7.57 million, essentially flat year over year, but beat estimates slightly. The company reported a net loss of $32.3 million, narrower than the prior year loss of $39.6 million, thanks to a non-cash gain of $38.5 million from warrant liabilities.However, the adjusted EBITDA loss widened to $35.8 million from $27 million a year ago, reflecting a significant uptick in R&D and acquisition-related expenses. Operating expenses rallied 38% to $83.2 million, underscoring IonQ\u2019s aggressive push to expand its quantum footprint.Despite the financial losses, the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance and showcased strong momentum in commercialization, government partnerships and M&A.Strategic Wins Reinforce IonQ's Market PositionA cornerstone of IONQ\u2019s first-quarter success was the $22-million sale of its Forte Enterprise system to EPB in Tennessee. This marked the first time a commercial customer has deployed both a quantum computer and a quantum network. The deployment not only added meaningful revenues but also validated IonQ\u2019s dual-platform model, positioning it at the intersection of quantum computing and networking.IonQ deepened its global presence through new partnerships in Japan and South Korea, and expanded its technological breadth via three acquisitions \u2014 Lightsynq, Capella and ID Quantique. These moves position IONQ to lead in quantum internet infrastructure and secure communications, areas where demand is rapidly growing and competition is intensifying.IONQ Builds Quantum Ecosystem With Long-Term VisionBeyond hardware and acquisitions, IonQ is focused on building an end-to-end quantum ecosystem. Recent innovations include cloud availability of its systems through AWS, progress in quantum machine learning applications, and photonic interconnects for scalability. Additionally, its selection by DARPA for a national quantum benchmarking initiative cements its credibility with the U.S. government.What makes IonQ stand out is its commitment to scaling the quantum internet, not just computing power. With Lightsynq\u2019s quantum repeater tech enabling 100 km photon transmission and Capella\u2019s satellite-based QKD capabilities, IonQ is laying the groundwork for a global, secure quantum network.IonQ\u2019s Strong Financial Cushion Enables Bold InvestmentsIONQ ended the first quarter of 2025 with nearly $700 million in cash and equivalents, giving it ample firepower to execute its roadmap without resorting to dilution or debt. This liquidity buffer allows the company to pursue aggressive R&D and acquisitions, even as near-term revenue remains modest. With a robust balance sheet, IonQ has the flexibility to absorb losses while building toward long-term monetization.IONQ\u2019s Estimate Revision TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed for 2025 over the past 30 days, as you can see below, depicting analysts\u2019 optimism. The estimated figure indicates a much narrower loss than the year-ago reported loss of $1.56.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 97.3%.\u00a0Valuation: A Lofty PremiumValuation remains a concern for the company. IonQ\u2019s forward 12-month price/sales ratio sits at a steep 75.86, far above the industry average of 3.34. Even though this figure has fluctuated between 20.55 and 229.06 over the past two years, it underscores the high expectations baked into the current share price.Yes, the IONQ stock trades at a 35.5% discount to its 52-week high, but it has also skyrocketed 467.7% from its 52-week low, highlighting the speculative nature of its movement. With limited revenues and significant losses, the premium valuation hinges entirely on IonQ\u2019s ability to execute flawlessly and capture the nascent quantum market ahead of competitors.\u00a0Potential Headwinds for IONQIonQ\u2019s largest hurdle in the near term is its cost structure. The company\u2019s heavy investment in talent, R&D and integration has led to ballooning expenses that overshadow stagnant revenue growth. A delay in revenue ramp-up or unexpected integration challenges from its multiple acquisitions can weigh on investor sentiment.Moreover, competition is intensifying globally. Chinese initiatives in satellite-based quantum communications, in particular, are accelerating. IonQ must prove that it cannot only keep pace technically but also commercialize its advances more effectively than rivals.The quantum computing landscape is marked by intense competition, with tech giants like IBM, Alphabet \u2019s GOOGL Google, and Microsoft MSFT committing billions of dollars to advance the technology. Meanwhile, emerging players such as Baidu, Amazon, and Rigetti Computing RGTI are also aggressively working to carve out their share of this rapidly evolving market. Quantinuum, a joint venture backed by Honeywell, is IonQ\u2019s most comparable rival in the trapped-ion space, boasting high fidelity and commercial readiness. Rigetti offers a full-stack superconducting platform but remains in early-stage commercialization with modest revenue. D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS operates in the quantum annealing domain, targeting optimization problems with above 1,200 qubit systems. Google Quantum AI unit is a dominant force in superconducting qubit development and set benchmarks in scalability and quantum supremacy. These players collectively shape the highly competitive and rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape that IonQ must navigate.How to Play IonQ Stock NowIONQ stands at the forefront of a technological revolution, with its dual focus on quantum computing and networking uniquely positioning it for long-term disruption. The recent 21% increase in share price following first-quarter 2025 earnings is more than just momentum; it reflects meaningful strategic progress.The $22-million commercial deal with EPB, expanding government partnerships like DARPA\u2019s benchmarking initiative, and acquisitions that bolster capabilities in quantum internet infrastructure all underscore IonQ\u2019s leadership in a rapidly evolving space.Despite high R&D expenses and integration risks, IonQ\u2019s nearly $700 million cash position provides the financial flexibility to pursue innovation aggressively without compromising its long-term vision. While the stock\u2019s valuation is lofty, the narrowing consensus loss estimates and reaffirmed guidance signal growing confidence in execution.For long-term investors willing to embrace volatility, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company offers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a company building the foundation of next-generation computing and secure communications.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).Zacks Investment Research",

It is one of the most successful hedge funds in history, helping founder David Tepper amass a fortune north of $20 billion. He used some of that to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers.Tepper's fund sold its positions in FedEx (350,000 shares) and Intel (1 million shares), while adding new positions in L3Harris Technologies (300,000 shares) and Apple (1.25 million shares).Along with adding Apple, a stake currently worth about $264 million, Appaloosa rejiggered its Magnificent Seven holdings. It sold roughly $50 million of Nvidia, $20 million of Amazon.com, and $200 million of Microsoft. It added about $20 million of Alphabet and $40 million of Meta Platforms.Overall, Magnificent Seven exposure has increased.
